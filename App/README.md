## Notes

### Airflow

The choice between running one Airflow instance with multiple DAGs versus multiple Airflow instances each with a single DAG depends on the specific requirements of your project. Here are some considerations:

Resource Utilization: Running multiple Airflow instances can consume more resources because each instance will have its own scheduler and webserver processes. If your backend services are lightweight and don't require a lot of resources, it might be more efficient to run a single Airflow instance with multiple DAGs.

Isolation: Running multiple Airflow instances provides better isolation between your backend services. If one service fails or causes an issue, it won't affect the other services. This can be beneficial if your services have different requirements or dependencies that might conflict with each other.

Scalability: If your backend services are expected to scale independently, running multiple Airflow instances might be a better choice. Each service can scale its Airflow instance as needed without affecting the other services.

Maintenance: Maintaining multiple Airflow instances can be more complex and time-consuming than maintaining a single instance. You'll need to monitor, update, and troubleshoot each instance separately.

In general, if your backend services are closely related and have similar requirements, it might be simpler and more efficient to run a single Airflow instance with multiple DAGs. If your services are independent and have different requirements, running multiple Airflow instances might be a better choice.
