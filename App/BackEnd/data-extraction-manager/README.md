data_sources/base_source.py: This file would contain a base class that defines the interface for a data source. The other data source classes would inherit from this base class.

data_sources/guardian_source.py and data_sources/nytimes_source.py: These files would contain classes that inherit from BaseSource and implement the methods for fetching data from The Guardian and The New York Times APIs, respectively.

data_processor/processor.py: This file would contain a class that uses the data sources to fetch data and standardizes it into a common format.

data_writer/neo4j_writer.py: This file would contain a class that takes the standardized data and writes it to a Neo4j database.

task_scheduler/cron_scheduler.py: This file would contain a class or function that schedules the data fetching, processing, and writing tasks to run at regular intervals.

utils/helpers.py: This file would contain any utility functions or classes that are used in multiple places in your code.

tests/test_data_sources.py, tests/test_data_processor.py, and tests/test_data_writer.py: These files would contain unit tests for your data sources, data processor, and data writer classes, respectively.

config/settings.py: This file would contain any configuration settings for your application.

main.py: This file would be the main entry point of your application. It would use the classes and functions defined in the other files to set up and start the data pipeline.

Dockerfile: This file would contain the instructions for building your Docker container.

requirements.txt: This file would list the Python packages that your application depends on.
