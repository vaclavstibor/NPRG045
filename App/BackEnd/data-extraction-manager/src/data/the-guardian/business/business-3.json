        "content": "The UK competition regulator has launched an investigation into the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three to create the UK’s largest mobile phone operator. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) now has up to 40 days to examine the deal and decide whether it warrants being subjected to a full, in-depth investigation on competition grounds. Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy.”   Related: Virgin Media is most complained about UK broadband provider   In a separate move this week, the government said the stake in Vodafone held by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group posed a national security risk to the UK. The Cabinet Office issued a notice late on Wednesday warning that the 14.6% stake held by Emirates Telecoms, which is also known as e&, amounted to a security concern given Vodafone’s strategic role in UK telecoms services. The government has now ordered a “national security committee” to be set up at Vodafone that will oversee and monitor any sensitive work the telecoms firm carries out that could have an impact on national security. In 2016, the CMA and the European Commission blocked Three’s attempted takeover of O2, arguing that it would have risked higher prices. However, in 2022 the UK telecoms regulator changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. Ofcom had previously argued that dropping to only three networks in a country could harm consumers. Vodafone UK has a number of government contracts, and Three UK is owned by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, which may raise concerns about foreign joint-ownership of a key national asset, particularly given the city’s status as part of China. Vodafone UK has public sector contracts with the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, NHS 111 and local police forces. Ahmed Essam, the chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: “We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players.” The two companies are the UK’s third and fourth biggest operators respectively. The newly combined company will, if the merger is completed, have more than 27 million subscribers, leapfrogging EE, which is owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2, which is owned by Spain’s Telefónica and the US-listed company Liberty Global. Robert Finnegan, the chief executive of Three UK, said: “We are confident that this transaction will deliver significant benefits to our customers, the country and competition, and we look forward to working closely with the CMA as they review our notification.”"

        "content": "Superdry has parted ways with its fourth finance boss in five years as losses widen at the troubled UK fashion brand. The company said Shaun Wills, who has been the finance director for three years, is leaving the business and being replaced next week by the interim finance boss Giles David. Wills was preceded this time around by the interim finance boss Benedict Smith after Nick Gresham left in October 2020, less than two years after taking over from Ed Barker. Wills was on his second stint as Superdry’s finance boss, having first left the business in 2015.   Related: Dr Martens’ revenue plummets by a fifth as US sales plunge   David has previously worked at the struggling businesses McColl’s and the Casual Dining Group, both of which fell into administration. Superdry said he had a “strong track record in consumer-facing businesses where he has operated successfully in turnaround environment”. Superdry warned it was facing another tough year in which it expected results “to reflect the more challenging environment seen to date”. In delayed half-year results published on Friday, the company said sales fell 23.5% in the six months to 28 October. In the following 12 weeks to 20 January, sales were down 13.7% led by a 38% dive in wholesale sales. The group dropped to a loss of £25.3m in the half-year, before a £36.3m one-off benefit, principally the sale of its brand rights in south-east Asia. A year before, the group made a £13.6m underlying loss. Superdry said its sales had been affected by the “milder autumn that persisted through the peak Christmas trading period”. It added that weak consumer demand had also led to “heavy discounting across the sector”.  The company had warned before Christmas that profits would be affected by the mild weather but did not give a figure. Julian Dunkerton, the founder and chief executive who returned to Superdry via a boardroom coup in 2019 to try to turn the business around, said: “This has clearly been a difficult period for Superdry. A challenging consumer retail market, set against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and some remarkably unseasonal weather conditions have all combined to weaken the financial performance of the group. “These macro and external factors have been further exacerbated by the underperformance of our wholesale segment. While, to some extent, this was expected due to the decision to exit our US operations and the sale of the brand rights in non-core territories, the segment continues to prove challenging.” He added that the group had made “significant operational strides” despite its “near-term difficulties”. Wholesale sales were affected by a decision to exit the US and “structural changes to the broader market” such as the closure of many department stores. Superdry said it had stepped up efforts to save costs as it remained almost £29m in debt at the end of its half-year, an improvement from the £38m of net debt a year before. The company now expects to make £40m in savings this financial year, £5m more than previously expected. It is also looking to sell its brand rights in further territories and sell off old stock in order to raise cash to reduce its debts. Russell Pointon, the director of consumer and media at Edison Group, said: “Today’s results, against the backdrop of the recent profit warning and the announcement of PwC’s involvement in reviewing debt-raising options, underscore the magnitude of challenges Superdry confronts in its quest for financial stability.” The widening losses and falling sales continue a tough period for the brand, which has been struggling to engineer a turnaround for several years. It is understood that it hired the advisory firm PwC before Christmas to review options for handling its debts, with the company saying on Friday that “cash management remains a critical focus area for the business”. By 23 January the group had just under £34m in cash and undrawn debt facilities of £12.4m. In May last year, the company raised about £12m from shareholders including Dunkerton before turning to restructuring specialist Hilco in the summer for a £25m loan at a hefty interest rate of 10.5% plus the Bank of England base rate. That came on top of a £80m facility from the specialist lender Bantry Bay agreed in December 2022, currently capped at £60m, with £30m of that to be repaid within three years."

        "content": "The prospect of early interest rate cuts this year across leading industrialised nations received a blow on Thursday after figures showed the US economy grew at a faster pace than expected last year. A stronger than forecast increase in US gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.3% last year dented hopes in the US, while the European Central Bank hinted at delays to the first cut in the cost of borrowing. Meanwhile a strong start to the year by the UK economy appeared to give the Bank of England, which meets next week to decide its next move on interest rates, a reason to hold at the current level of 5.25% into the summer. After leaving interest rates unchanged on Thursday, the president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, warned that it was “premature to discuss rate cuts” as she insisted future decisions would depend on incoming data. Investors cut their forecasts for the total level of rate cuts by the ECB this year to 1.3 percentage points from 1.5 percentage points two weeks ago. The central bank said inflation across the eurozone was slowly trending downwards. But Lagarde added: “We need to be further along the disinflation process to be confident that inflation will be at target – sustainably so.” Germany has fallen into recession and France has struggled to grow over the last year, prompting calls for interest rates cuts to boost economic growth. Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said: “Germany is in an absolute hole with no prospect of getting out of it, and yet the ECB seem more worried about inflation than they are about a depression.” The ECB expects household and government spending to drive recovery but figures from the economy appear to be painting a bleaker picture, with manufacturing remaining in recession and services cooling. Lagarde said cuts to government energy subsidies could weaken the eurozone further, though disruption to shipping in the Red Sea could send inflation higher, complicating the situation.  Higher import and export costs, pushing up shop prices, could prevent the ECB from reacting to weakening growth by lowering borrowing costs. Next week, the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates. However, comments from Jerome Powell, chair of the central bank, will be intensely scrutinised to assess when the bank might begin reducing the burden on borrowers. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told Reuters: “It’s only fitting that a year that defied expectations would show growth that exceeded expectations. You have to squint to see weakness in the numbers. What’s not to like?  “The problem for the market is that the Fed doesn’t have to be in a hurry to cut. Rather than cutting sooner and faster, the Fed can cut later and slower.” The US economy expanded by 3.3% in the last quarter of 2023, according to the annualised estimate for GDP, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter, but higher than expected by analysts."

        "content": "The rate of shoplifting in England and Wales has hit its highest level for more than two decades after rising by nearly a third in a year, the latest crime figures show. Data from the Office for National Statistics revealed there were 402,482 shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales in the 12 months up to September 2023, the first time the number has exceeded 400,000 since records began in 2002. The figures illustrate the increasing problem many retailers face with theft from their shops, with the British Retail Consortium estimating that retail crime cost businesses £1.7bn last year. The number of incidents was up 32% compared with the 304,459 in the previous 12 months and surpassed the previous high of 382,642 incidents in 2018. The uptick in shoplifting has led to some supermarkets security-tagging products such as baby formula, butter and cheese, or drastically reducing the number of display items on shelves. The cost of living crisis is widely acknowledged as one of the biggest driving forces in the growing number of incidents, as household spending becomes squeezed. Shops have said an increase in the number of organised criminal gangs targeting stores is also fuelling the problem. In October, Sharon White, the chair of the John Lewis department store group, which also owns the supermarket chain Waitrose, said some organised gangs were “shoplifting to order” and targeting expensive items such as wines and spirits. Retailers say many cases are going unpunished, with Co-op Food revealing in September that police attended about two in 10 of the incidents its workers reported. To combat the growing problem, the government launched an action plan last October including measures such as the creation of a specialist team to target organised criminals behind targeted incidents, and pledges from police to prioritise responding to incidents where shop workers are attacked or where a security guard has detained an offender. But in the same month, the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, set out measures for criminals facing jail sentences of under 12 months to receive suspended sentences and community service, with shoplifters one of the groups of offenders expected to benefit most from the change. The overall number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales in the year to September 2023 stood at 6.7m, up 1% from 6.6m in the previous year and higher than 6.1m in the pre-pandemic year of 2019-20. Catherine Grant, of the ONS, said there was a “mixed picture of crime” but that police-recorded crime was showing “notable increases in some theft offences, including shoplifting” as well as a rise in thefts of motor vehicles. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “We’d always want to do more to combat shoplifting. I think there is work that has been done, particularly with private companies, about how we can go further to tackle this issue.”"

        "content": "In the wake of this week’s announcement (Royal Mail could save £650m by moving to three-day-a-week service, says Ofcom, 24 January), maybe someone could send out a postie to knock on Vince Cable’s door for a comment or two. It was he who, as business secretary in the coalition government, oversaw the privatisation of Royal Mail, pledging that it would not threaten the universal service obligation to deliver to any home in the UK on six days a week. Indeed, Mr Cable went as far as claiming that securing that specified level of service provision was the “overarching objective” of privatisation – despite warnings to the contrary from unions, industry and other dissenting voices. But this somewhat inevitable outcome should come as no surprise. As we’ve seen with most privatisations in the UK, it’s never been about achieving a long-term sustainable business model, more responsive to the needs of the communities and ordinary people; it’s about making a quick buck and damn the consequences. The evidence abounds. Be it the privatised water companies, utilities, train companies or the Royal Mail – nobody delivers for the public any more. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh • Deliver three days a week? If only! Where we live, in north-west London, you’re lucky if you get mail delivered one day a week. And as for parcels, whistle for it. A once-edible birthday present that was sent on 9 January still hasn’t arrived. A book sent in November? Nix. A DVD sent two weeks ago? All I have is emails from eBay asking me to rate it. On one of my despairing visits to the local delivery office to pick up our mail (letters only – parcels vanish into a black hole), I asked why this is. The woman at the counter (open 8am-10am only) said that they used to have 15 posties, but eight were “let go”. If they’re going to run a poste restante service, why not say so and have done with it? At least then we’d know where we are.Ruth BrandonLondon • I’m not sure what Ofcom is basing its plans on. Here in Portsmouth we are already on a three-days-a-week (or fewer) delivery schedule. It is not probable that we could get as many first-class letters in one delivery, all with different posting dates, if Royal Mail weren’t storing up post until there was enough volume to put a postie on the route. My retired parents, in a more rural location in Norfolk, don’t get deliveries more than once a week. They’ve taken to driving over to the local office every couple of days and collecting their mail. Even then letters are being lost for weeks. Before Christmas, a “Tracked 48” parcel took six days to reach us. It was left in our recycling bin after we had already left for the holiday. It is fortunate that we have good neighbours who found it before the bins were emptied.David HaguePortsmouth • Any decent citizen should welcome the prime minister’s commitment to maintaining Royal Mail’s universal six-day delivery. However, constructive help is needed. The government should scrap the VAT on Royal Mail’s extra services such as the special delivery. A more sustainable service is good for small business customers, the lifeblood of our economy. Good communications and infrastructure such as the universal delivery are key.John BarstowFittleworth, West Sussex • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "published_date": "2024-01-25T16:58:52+00:00",
        "content": "Lloyds Banking Group is planning to cut 1,600 staff from its branch network as it tries to reduce costs and push customers towards digital services as part of a corporate overhaul. The UK company said it was adapting to a shift in behaviour, with more than 21 million of its 26 million customers choosing to use its services online. But the job cuts are likely to raise concerns for the 8% of Lloyds customers – about 2 million – who exclusively rely on going into branches to manage their accounts. The bank will simultaneously create 830 jobs in its relationship growth team – amounting to an overall reduction of about 769 jobs – to provide a hybrid service of in-branch, video or phone appointments for customers. However, there is no guarantee that those new roles will be given to staff whose jobs are being cut. Lloyds is closing about 114 branches this year, leaving a network of 1,061 sites. The staff cuts will be aimed at senior branch workers, with Lloyds maintaining its most junior roles. The staff union, Accord, hopes most of the cuts will be on a voluntary redundancy basis, where workers ask to leave and receive some compensation, though it is likely to be offered only in some cases. In November, Lloyds confirmed plans to slash nearly 3,000 roles from the wider business – excluding its branches – focusing on middle-management roles including analyst and product management posts. Again, the bank said it was creating thousands of positions that would ultimately result in a net 120 roles being added to its workforce. The job cuts are part of a £3bn overhaul announced under the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, in early 2022 in an attempt to push further into digital banking, bulk up the corporate bank and wealth division, and strengthen Lloyds’ position as a UK landowner. Commenting on the latest round of job losses, a Lloyds spokesperson said: “As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it is important our people are available when it matters most. We are introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.” Accord said: “LBG announced significant changes to its branch network structure and ways of working, which it says are necessary because of changes in customer behaviour. The move represents a significant change to the branch networks and our members.”"

        "content": "The stake in Vodafone held by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group poses a national security risk to the UK, the government said. The Cabinet Office issued a notice late on Wednesday warning that the 14.6% stake held in Vodafone by Emirates Telecoms, which is also known as e&, amounted to a security concern given Vodafone’s strategic role in the UK’s telecommunications services. It has now ordered a “national security committee” to be set up at Vodafone, which will oversee and monitor any sensitive work it carries out which could have an impact on national security. The action is “necessary and proportionate” to “mitigate the risk to national security”, the government said. The warning comes after e&, which is 60% owned by the UAE government, increased its stake in Vodafone since an initial investment of £3bn in 2022. In April, the company upped its stake to 14.6%, before entering a strategic partnership agreement under which the e& chief executive, Hatem Dowidar, joined the Vodafone board. That move triggered the government to look into the deal under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, owing to Vodafone’s importance as strategic supplier of the UK government and being involved in the country’s cybersecurity infrastructure. However, the government had not previously made any public announcements saying it was looking into the partnership. The Cabinet Office said the partnership would enable e& to “materially influence policy at Vodafone”. Oliver Dowden, secretary of state at the Cabinet Office, has now made several orders, including requirements that the UK government is notified if any elements of the relationship changes. UK government requirements must also be met regarding Vodafone’s board composition and functions. Under the terms of the strategic partnership, e& can increase its stake to just under 25%, while also having the opportunity to add another executive to the board if its ownership tops 20%. The state-owned firm has previously said it planned to be a “long-term and supportive shareholder in Vodafone and is not seeking to exert control or influence the company’s board or management team”. The company operates in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa and has an estimated 164 million customers globally. A Vodafone spokesperson said: “We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e&, and for e& to take a seat on our board.” The Guardian contacted e& for comment. The Vodafone agreement is one of several deals in recent years made by UAE-based companies and investment vehicles seeking to invest and grow their stakes in UK companies. Regulators have been looking into the prospective transfer of control over the Telegraph and Spectator from the Barclay family to the Abu Dhabi-backed investment group RedBird IMI on public interest grounds. Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had been due to report on Friday, but are now likely to be asked to look again at the deal and report in mid-March if, as expected, a second investigation is launched after the culture secretary said she was “minded to” issue a new public interest intervention notice. Lucy Frazer made the announcement on Wednesday after a last-minute corporate structure change by RedBird raised fresh concerns. There has been outrage from some politicians – as well as former and current Telegraph journalists – about the deal, which would allow an overseas government to control a significant stake in a UK national newspaper. Vodafone also faces separate regulatory scrutiny over its proposed £15bn merger deal with a fellow telecoms company, Three. An investigation was launched by the CMA in October to look into whether the tie-up could affect consumer options and prices. The union Unite has claimed the deal could add £300 a year to some phone bills. "

Last week, she told Bloomberg in Davos that the bank could start cutting rates in the summer. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. Growth slowed to an annualised rate of 3.3% from 4.9% in the third quarter. The economy grew by 2.5% in 2023, its best performance since 2021.

We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! – JK  Updated at 3.08pm GMT    2.57pm GMT  Bank of England, Treasury press ahead with 'digital pound'  The government and the Bank of England will press ahead with the design of a digital pound without pledging that a “Britcoin” will become available to the British public. Officials at the Bank and the Treasury said a consultation exercise last year showed there was an appetite for a new method of transferring money electronically. Responding to concerns that the Bank and the government would have access to users’ personal data, officials said primary legislation would safeguard digital currency users in the same way bank accounts are protected at the moment. The Treasury said it would also maintain cash in circulation after a strong backlash from among the 50,000 respondents to the consultation, including MPs, who feared paper banknotes and coins would be phased out. More than 40 countries are understood to be pursuing the development of a digital currency that is expected to rival the crypto currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are valued on independent exchanges. Supporters of the scheme, which could be launched before the end of the decade with the Bank acting as the backstop or custodian of the new digital currency, said it will allow innovation in the UK financial services sector, keeping firms in financial centres across the UK at the forefront of a global market place. Critics, including members of the House of Lords economic affairs committee, have said they have “yet to hear a convincing case” for why the UK needs a central bank digital currency (CBDC), while some MPs asked whether the plan is “a solution in search of a problem”. Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at research and campaign group Positive Money, said the government needed to respond to the rise of private crypto currencies.  The huge response to the consultation highlights the importance of a genuinely inclusive national conversation on the future of our money, which is presently facing a rapid privatisation as cash gets replaced by electronic bank money.      2.41pm GMT   Colin Finlayson, fixed income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, says the ECB may have to start cutting rates earlier than the summer.  The ECB kept policy unchanged at 4%, as widely expected. Although Ms Lagarde attempted to push back on the current market expectations of rate-cuts in the coming month, she did have to concede that both underlying inflation and inflation expectations have continued to fall.  With the ECB current growth outlook characterised as having risks to the downside, the market paid little attention to her attempts to dampen rate-cut enthusiasm. The ECB are guiding towards the summer at the earliest for any rate cuts to begin but we feel that they may not have the luxury of waiting that long.      2.39pm GMT   On the Lloyds job cuts, here is a statement from the bank:  As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it’s important our people are available when it matters most. We’re introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.  Lloyds is cutting 1,600 jobs as part of a shift to more online services but is also creating 830 jobs elsewhere – “in an expanded relationship growth team – part of our consumer relationships business – where colleagues will work to understand our customers’ financial goals and needs and meet them through our products and services”. The Accord union explains the changes in detail on its website:  There will be no compulsory role reductions at grades A and B, although grade B colleagues can express an interest in voluntary redundancy. Changes to management structures will mean there will be redundancies at grade C and above. The aim is to achieve most of these reductions through voluntary redundancy.   Updated at 2.56pm GMT    2.37pm GMT   Asked whether she stands by her forecast made in December that the eurozone will avoid recession, Lagarde said the most recent PMI surveys are encouraging for the economy.   People can challenge PMI numbers and they do but at least we are seeing numbers that are either to the upside or or stable… We recognise the weakness of of growth and that weakness obviously applies to Q4. You know there are multiple ways to define what is a recession, the technical terminology, two quarters in a row that that are negative is one way to look at it.  I remember discussing that with my colleague and friend Janet Yellen, where the US had two quarters in a row that were negative. And when I said well, Janet, you must be in a recession and she said: ‘What! With those unemployment numbers, forget it. We are not in recession.’ So I think we have to be attentive to all sorts of data signals and understanding of the economy.  This concludes the press conference.     2.19pm GMT   Back at the ECB in Frankfurt, chief Christine Lagarde is asked whether her comments mean that a rate cut in April is unlikely. She said:  In terms of an overall evaluation of our policy trajectory, which many of you are after, we need to be further along in the disinflation process before we can be sufficiently confident that inflation will actually hit the target in a timely manner and in a sustainable way at target. So it’s a disinflation process in which we are, it is working, but we need to be more advanced. and we need to be further along in that process, to be confident that inflation will be at target sustainably. So I’m giving you a little indication about what I call the trajectory, but it’s not forward guidance, it’s trying to give you the mechanics that we will apply in our considerations when we look at data in the next few weeks.   Updated at 2.20pm GMT    2.13pm GMT  Lloyds cuts 1,600 jobs as part of digital switch, Reuters reports  Just in: Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money.  It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Banks are keen to cut costs amid tough economic conditions and pressure on profit margins from competition and peaking interest rates. Rival Barclays also slashed thousands of jobs last year, with the majority in the bank’s back office support division.  Updated at 2.24pm GMT    2.06pm GMT   Lagarde also said the ECB is keeping a close eye on developments in the Red Sea, where attacks on ships by Yemen’s Houthi rebels have led to ships being rerouted, and concerns about shipping delays and higher costs, which could push inflation up.  We are observing very carefully because we are seeing that shipping costs are increasing, delivery delays are increasing. And while we all know that there is more shipping capacity than there was in in 2020 and 2021, we also know that costs and fees are increasing.      2.01pm GMT  Lagarde: 'premature to discuss rate cuts'  The Q&A has started. The first question is whether the governing council discussed a rate cut at today’s meeting. Lagarde said:  The consensus around the table of the Governing Council was that it was premature to discuss rate cuts. One other thing, which was very much a consensus around the table was that we had to continue to be data dependent.   Watch the ECB press conference live: President Christine @Lagarde explains today’s monetary policy decisions https://t.co/ZiyUyrahlk— European Central Bank (@ecb) January 25, 2024   Updated at 2.02pm GMT    1.58pm GMT   Lagarde summed up the risks to inflation:  Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, and hamper global trade. Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wage wages increase by more than expected or profit margins prove more resilient by contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolve in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations of the future path for oil and gas prices.      1.57pm GMT   Turning to inflation, ECB president Christine Lagarde said:  Inflation is expected to ease further over the course of this year as the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post pandemic reopening of the economy fade and tighter monetary policy continues to weigh on demand. Almost all measures of underlying inflation declined further in December. The elevated rate of wage increases and falling labour productivity are keeping domestic price pressures high, although these two have started to ease.  And the growth outlook:  Looking now at the risk assessment, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are key sources of geopolitical risks. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could be higher if rising real incomes mean spending increases by more than anticipated or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected.      1.53pm GMT   The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of economic health – grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%.   Related: US economic growth ends 2023 with surprising strength   The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many – including the Fed – had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a “soft landing”. Hiring has remained robust – unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low – and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. “The Fed – so far – has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,” said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth “but we are not using the recession word yet.”  Updated at 1.54pm GMT    1.52pm GMT   European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has kicked off the press conference with a statement on the economy.  Looking at the economic activity, the euro area economy is likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of ‘23. The incoming data continue to signal weakness in the near term. However, some forward looking server indicators point to a pickup in growth further ahead. The labour market has remained robust. The unemployment rate at 6.4% in November has fallen back to its lowest level since the start of the euro and more workers have entered the labour force.      1.48pm GMT  US economy grows faster than expected  The US economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, powered by consumer spending. GDP rose at a 3.3% annualised rate, according to the government’s preliminary estimate, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter. This compares with market forecasts of 2.2% growth. In 2023, the economy expanded by 2.5%, its strongest performance since 2021.  Updated at 3.01pm GMT    1.23pm GMT   ECB president Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference at 1.45pm GMT. You can watch it here.     1.17pm GMT  ECB keeps interest rates unchanged  The European Central Bank’s governing council has kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. The ECB’s rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. Its deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, is at 4%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. The central bank explained:  The incoming information has broadly confirmed its previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Aside from an energy-related upward base effect on headline inflation, the declining trend in underlying inflation has continued, and the past interest rate increases keep being transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. Tight financing conditions are dampening demand, and this is helping to push down inflation.   Updated at 1.20pm GMT    12.55pm GMT   Ahead of the European Central Bank’s interest rate decision at 1.15pm GMT, Germany’s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest level since early December. Germany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, touched a high of 2.371% earlier. Yields move inversely to prices. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged but investors will be looking for any hints on when borrowing costs will start to come down. The ECB’s deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, was last raised in September to 4% – the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. The rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. Jeroen Blokland, founder of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, tweeted:  Yikes! The German #ifo Index, a key bellwether for the German economy, unexpectedly fell in January and points to a #recession.

The FTSE 100 index is trading 14 points, or 0.2%, lower at 7,513. Germany’s Dax has lost 0.4%, while France’s CAC is down 0.45% and Italy’s FTSE MiB has slid nearly 1% ahead of the European Central Bank’s interest rate decision. In the oil market, Brent crude, the global benchmark, is $1.07 higher at $81.10 a barrel, a 1.3% gain. US light crude has gained $1.11 to $76.2 a barrel, up 1.5%. Oil prices rallied after data showed US crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, and the Chinese central bank’s cut in banks’ reserve requirements (the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve) raised hopes of more economic stimulus to kickstart the economy.   Related: China announces 0.5% cut in banks’ minimum reserves    Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.12am GMT  UK retail sales dive most in 3 years – CBI  Retail sales across the UK fell at the fastest pace in three years this month, according to an industry survey. The Confederation of British Industry’s monthly retail sales balance, which measures sales volumes versus a year ago, fell to -50 in January from -32 in December, the weakest since December 2021 when Britain was in a Covid-19 lockdown. The balance measures the number of retailers who said sales volumes rose minus those who said sales fell. February won’t be much better, the survey suggests. The volume of sales for this time of the year was -47, the lowest reading since May 2020. Martin Sartorius, the CBI’s principal economist, said:  Looking ahead, demand conditions in the sector will remain challenging as higher interest rates continue to feed through to mortgage payments and household incomes.  Official figures published last week showed British retailers suffered the biggest drop in sales for almost three years in December, raising the risk that the economy slipped into recession late last year.     10.42am GMT  Supreme problems: Domino’s Pizza shares dive 30%, wiping $1.5bn  Domino’s Pizza shares have dived, wiping more than $1.5bn from the company’s market value. A trifecta of problems facing the international operations of Domino’s Pizza Enterprises sparked a 30% plunge in the share price of the Australian-owned company on Thursday. Domino’s, which holds the branding rights in several countries of the American pizza chain, disclosed that net profit before tax for the recent six-month period was expected to be between $87m and $90m, down from almost $105m a year earlier. The shareholder response to the trading update was ruthless. Managing director Don Meij convened a call with analysts and investors, and sought to explain the troubles. “It’s quite humbling to sit in front of you and to be able to share the disappointing results in part of our business today,” he said on the video conference. “It really shows a rollercoaster.”   Related: Supreme problems: Domino’s Pizza shares dive 30%, wiping $1.5bn        9.52am GMT  Norges Bank keeps rates on hold, to stay at that level 'for some time'  Norway’s central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%, as expected, and said the cost of borrowing was likely to stay at that level “for some time ahead”. The economic prospects for Norway do not appear to have changed materially since December, Norges Bank’s monetary policy committee said. Norges Bank’s governor Ida Wolden Bache said:  The committee assesses that the policy rate is now sufficiently high to return inflation to target within a reasonable time horizon.  Monetary policy is having a tightening effect, and the economy is cooling down. At the same time, business costs have increased considerably in recent years, and continued high wage growth and the crown depreciation through 2023 will likely restrain disinflation.  In December, the central bank raised rates in a surprise move, even though inflation had slowed. Norway’s core inflation was 5.5% in December, a 15-month low, down from a peak of 7% last June, but still above the central bank’s 2% target. Economists are expecting a rate cut between July and September and another one in the final three months of 2024, which would bring the benchmark rate down to 4% by the end of the year.     9.43am GMT  Halfords hit by Christmas sales slump  In the UK, the bike and car parts retailer Halfords said sales in December were much weaker than in October and November. It explained that mild and wet weather affected demand for winter products and brought fewer people into its stores, while cash-strapped customers reined in spending in the run-up to Christmas.  Sales of car products fell 15.3% in December, after averaging 10.2% in October and November on a like-for-like basis (at stores open at least a year). However in January sales growth returned to those levels as conditions normalised, Halfords said. Group revenues grew by 2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. However, cycling and consumer tyres were “performing significantly worse than anticipated and have weakened in Q3”. Sales of bikes and accessories slid 1.2% in the quarter.  Halfords said it performed better than the cycling market as a whole, with kids bikes sales up 5% in December. Volumes in the cycling and consumer tyres markets are below pre-pandemic levels by 28% and 14% respectively.  The company is cutting costs of £35m this year, more than previously flagged, and announced a partnership with the specialist tyre distributor Bond International.  Graham Stapleton, the chief executive, said:  Trading in Q4 has begun strongly and we remain focused on everything that we can control, with a number of initiatives underway to achieve further efficiencies within the business, as well as investing in areas where we see real opportunities for future growth.      9.18am GMT   In German manufacturing, business expectations improved but remained pessimistic. Order books continue to shrink, albeit less rapidly than at the end of the year. The business climate in the service sector clouded over considerably while in trade, the index fell to its lowest level since October 2022. In construction, the business climate index also continued to slide.      9.16am GMT  Germany 'stuck in recession' as business confidence worsens  In Germany, business confidence worsened in January, as Europe’s biggest economy remains weak. The closely watched business climate index from the Munich-based Ifo institute fell to 85.2 from 86.3 in December. The institute’s president Clemens Fuest said:  Companies assessed their current situation as worse. Their expectations for the months ahead were also once again more pessimistic. The German economy is stuck in recession.  Technically, Germany dodged a recession at the end of last year (defined by two or more consecutive quarters of contraction). In the final quarter of last year, the German economy shrank by 0.3%, compared with the previous quarter, when output flatlined. But the economy contracted by 0.3% in 2023 and is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s amid the impact of higher energy costs and weaker industrial demand.  🇩🇪 ifo Business Climate Index Falls – The ifo Business Climate Index fell to 85.2 points in January, down from 86.3 points in December.

Sales revenues fell by 14% last year from 2022 while the market slumped by 22%, according to Foxtons. It said it has gone into 2024 with an under-offer pipeline far ahead of last year and expects year-on-year sales revenue growth in the first quarter, and further growth through the year. Things have improved in recent weeks. The firm explained:  Buyer demand has grown as mortgage rates have begun to normalise, with good levels of growth seen in recent weeks as the first mortgage products are released with rates below 4% since the September 2022 mini-budget. Any sustained reduction in interest rates is expected to spur significant further growth in buyer demand.  Total revenues rose 5% to £147m last year while adjusted operating profit edged higher to £14m from £13.9m. Gittins, the chief executive, has invested in the lettings business, which makes up 70% of group revenues and grew by 16%, delivering more than £100m revenue for the first time. In bad news for tenants, “rents are expected to stabilise and remain at historically elevated levels.” Gittins, who returned to Foxtons (where he started his career) in September 2022 after running rival Chestertons, said:  2023 has been a transformational year for Foxtons, following the implementation of a refreshed strategy and operational turnaround plan. We have delivered a year of market share growth and have ended the year with revenue and adjusted operating profit ahead of market expectations; our operational upgrades and investment in fee earners, training, data and brand, coupled with a return to driving innovation in the industry, are now consistently delivering material benefits to our competitiveness and market positioning, helping us to end 2023 as the UK’s fastest growing large lettings and sales agency brand.   Updated at 8.46am GMT    8.00am GMT  Dr Martens hit by lower US sales  Dr Martens has been hit by lower sales in the US, as cash-strapped consumers refused to splash out for Christmas. The British bootmaker said sales made directly to customers fell 3% in the three months to the end of December, its third quarter, and wholesale revenues tumbled 46%. Overall group revenues were down 18%. The company, which was founded in 1960 in Northamptonshire, is still expecting a decline of nearly 10% over the full year (“high single-digit percentage”). Kenny Wilson, the chief executive, said:  This was driven by a weak USA performance, as expected. Trading in the quarter was volatile and we saw a softer December in line with trends across the industry. Whilst the consumer environment remains challenging, we are taking action to continue to grow our iconic brand and invest in our business.   Updated at 8.02am GMT    7.48am GMT  Labour to unveil plans for City at forthcoming business conference  Labour will use its sold-out business conference next week to unveil the party’s City policy plans, the Guardian can reveal, as it tries to win over hundreds of UK executives before a general election. More than 500 bosses from across British finance will gather in London on 1 February for the event, where opposition leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, plan to “showcase Labour’s offer to business”. The party is hoping that the conference – which sold out within two hours in the autumn – will demonstrate its “commitment to work hand in glove with the business community” and will use it as an opportunity to reveal its business policy plans after two major industry reviews. The Guardian understands that will include Labour’s much-anticipated strategy for the City and will detail how the party plans to harness the strength of the UK’s £275bn financial and professional services sector.

The next UK government will face the toughest tax and spending decisions in 70 years, according to a leading think tank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said a combination of high interest rates and weak growth means whoever wins the general election later this year will find it “more difficult to reduce debt as a fraction of national income than in any parliament since at least the 1950s.” It warned that Jeremy Hunt’s much-predicted budget tax cuts – he will unveil the budget on 6 March – risk being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to “level” with voters before polling day.   Related: Labour and Tories need to be honest about economic trade-offs, says IFS   Chinese stocks rallied after a cut in Chinese bank reserve requirements, releasing about a trillian yuan for lending (nearly £111bn). The Shanghai Composite rose 3%, after hitting a four-year low on Monday, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2% while Japan’s Nikkei was little changed. Investors have been selling Chinese equities for months, amid worries about the sluggish economy and the country’s property crisis.

        "content": "The National Holden motor museum will put its name and its classic cars up for auction after failing to find a buyer to take it over. The closures marks the end of longest, continuously running, single-maker motor museum in Australia and the end of a local fixture in the regional Victorian town of Echuca.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  Its current operators, Tony Galea and Mark Galea (no relation), put the museum up for sale in August after the owner of their building said it was being put up for sale and their lease would end in three years. “It’s not great, but it is what it is,” Tony Galea said. When the museum failed to attract a buyer, the business partners announced on social media last Thursday, that it would auction-off its assets and close its doors. “It’s with great sadness that we announce the impending closure of the National Holden Motor Museum on 14 April 2024,” it said. “Thank you to display vehicle owners, current and past, our loyal social media followers, local businesses, visitors, friends and families for supporting us over the years.”   Related: ‘Last Holden’ made in Adelaide snapped up for $750,000 at auction   Tony Galea said the business was “profitable” and “going very, very well” but over three decades of operations, it had taken a toll on the business partners who have not been on a proper holiday since taking it over. “It’s basically burnout,” he said, “We love doing it, we love talking to the customers, listening to their stories – it’s great. But we’ve just got burnout now. “This is a big tourist destination, over 1.5 million tourists come through the region. This business is open seven days a week, 360 days of the year. If you add those days up, we don’t get many breaks. It’s taken a toll on us, physically and mentally. “I’m a grandad now, so I want to spend more time with the grandkids. And I want to see my parents. They’re not going to be around for ever.” The National Holden motor museum began in 1984 with two brothers, Alex and David Hughes, who would rescue damaged or old Holden cars and lovingly restore them. They started the museum in Bayswater, but it moved several times before being taken over by Tony Galea and Mark Galea. Holden’s CEO, Bill Hamel opened the museum when it moved to Echuca in 1993. “It was surreal,” Tony Galea says. “We both moved up from Melbourne, from the south-eastern suburbs. A bit of a tree change.”   Related: A history of Holden in Australia – timeline   “We made changes in the museum which we believe were good. We continually rotated the cars in here and the people kept coming back year after year, putting their head in to see what’s new. “It was a good feeling. We started to do things our way.” The museum is now host to the last SS Redline ute to roll off an Australian production, the last Holden Caprice and a GTS Maloo. Others in the collection include a first-build LJ Torana and a one-of-a-kind 1984 WB Caprice made from spare parts in the factory that was never put on the road. There are now 51 vehicles on loan to the museum, and another three cars owned by the business partners themselves. These three vehicles, along with the museum’s name and other assets will go up for auction through Burns & Co Auctions on 18 May. Since announcing the closure on social media, Galea said there had been renewed interest from potential buyers and anyone who wanted to take over the museum was welcome to buy the assets at auction. “At the end of the day, they can come to the auction and buy the whole lot,” he said. “If they buy the name, they can use it wherever they want.” • This article was amended on 27 January 2024 to correct the number of classic cars being auctioned from seven to three."

Polling since the end of the pandemic shutdowns has consistently shown that consumers are pessimistic about the state of the economy. There are signs that the gloom may be lifting. Last week the University of Michigan’s closely watched monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, its biggest monthly advance since 2005. “Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,” said Joanne Hsu, the University of Michigan’s director of surveys."

        "content": "Dr Martens said revenue dropped by nearly a fifth in the final three months of 2023, as sales in the US continued to plunge and inflation-weary consumers carried on reining in their spending. The British bootmaker said in a trading update on Thursday that sales fell by 18% in its third quarter to £274m, and that, like many retailers, it had seen a “softer December”, with many cash-strapped shoppers deciding not to splash out for Christmas. While sales made directly to customers fell by 3% in the third quarter, wholesale revenues – which account for demand by other retailers that sell Dr Marten footwear in their own stores – fell by 46%.   Related: Dr Martens: just another victory for private equity sellers over City mugs | Nils Pratley   “This was driven by a weak USA performance, as expected,” the company said. Total revenues dropped by 31% in the US, compared with 15% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and by 8% in Asia. Dr Martens said its US bosses were taking “action”, focusing on marketing and increasing online sales capabilities in order to recover revenues and grow the brand in America. The boot brand has a wide following, having originally been created in 1945 by a young German army doctor, Klaus Märtens, who designed an air-cushioned sole to help his recovery from a broken foot. The chunky boots famed for their yellow stitching were then introduced to Britain in 1960 by a Northamptonshire footwear maker, where their sturdy design first gained popularity among postal delivery workers and factory staff. The eight-holed 1460 boot was later embraced by skinheads and punks. A pair of the classic design of DM boots now costs £170. The retailer maintained its previous guidance for full-year revenues, which could be nearly 10% lower than a year earlier, noting it was expecting a fall in the “high single digits”. “Trading in the quarter was volatile and we saw a softer December in line with trends across the industry,” said Kenny Wilson, the chief executive. However, Wilson tried to strike a positive tone, saying: “While the consumer environment remains challenging, we are taking action to continue to grow our iconic brand and invest in our business. We remain confident in our product pipeline.” Shares were up by 3.5% at 79p after the announcement, making Dr Martens one of the top risers on the FTSE 250 on Thursday morning. However, the shares are about 79% lower than the 370p float price in January 2021."

        "content": "Treasury has estimated the redesigned stage three tax cuts would add just 0.1 percentage point or less to annual price increases – too small to affect the trajectory of inflation.\nTreasury analysed how the government’s proposed changes to the distribution of the tax cuts – with those on higher incomes getting less, and lower incomes more – would affect consumption, along with other areas, such women’s participation in the workforce. It deemed the changes to inflation to be small.\nTax receipts would grow by $1.3bn in 2024-25, and increase by about $28bn over the decade to 2034-35, compared with the original version, Treasury modelling showed.\nGuardian Australia understands that it was on the basis the demand effects were assessed to be minimal that Treasury did not plug the full suite of numbers into its main macro models. The Reserve Bank, too, is not expected to adjust its forecasts for inflation when it updates its predictions on 6 February.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers told ABC’s RN Breakfast on Thursday that the government had consulted the RBA governor, Michelle Bullock, as had the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy.\n\n Related: Stage-three tax cuts: how the Albanese government’s changes will affect you  \n\n“[Bullock] has indicated to us that she does not expect what we’re proposing today to alter the Reserve Bank’s forecasts or expectations for inflation,” Chalmers said.\n“I’m going to release in full the Treasury advice that we were provided in coming to this decision,” he said. “I’ve got it in front of me and it says very clearly the redesign of the stage-three tax cuts will not add to inflationary pressures.”\nAs reported on Wednesday, economists don’t expect the revisions to be large enough prompt the RBA to alter its interest rate plans in 2024 or beyond.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nGuardian Australia understands both Treasury and the RBA determined the changes were not going to stoke pressure on prices because the total cost to the budget of the cuts was unchanged. The expected $20.7bn tax cut had been factored into models used by both organisation since it was legislated in 2019.\nHowever, the redistribution of that cut so that those earning less than about $146,000 a year would receive a larger tax cut while those earning more would get less. Since those earning less typically spend more of any tax relief, there will be some extra demand in the economy.It is understood Treasury was first asked by the government to start considering changes to Stage 3 around Christmas. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese gave his first media conference on 3 January, where he called on treasury and the finance department to provide ideas for easing cost of living pressures.\nAmong the work done was the first modelling of how stage 3 would affect participation in the labour market, filling a gap from the previous government.\nTreasury determined that the difference between the tendency of middle income earners to consume and that of high income earners was too small to have an inflationary impact.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Kearns, who was the RBA’s head of domestic markets until joining Challenger as chief economist a year ago, said it would probably “take an analyst half a day to make a back-of-the-envelope” estimate about the cuts’ inflationary effect.\nIn Treasury’s case, the modifications could be factored into a fiscal model and also one for the wider economy, Kearns said.\n“It’s obviously a political decision” for Treasury not to run the model even if the aggregate effect on prices is likely to be “pretty small”, he said.\nWarren Hogan, chief economist for Judo Bank, said it would be “surprising” Treasury hadn’t done specific modelling for inflation.\n“[It] suggests this has all happened in the past few weeks,” Hogan said. “As an experienced economists, one can do the simple arithmetic on the impacts on consumption and domestic demand pretty easily and quickly using a few plausible assumptions about propensity to consume and save at different income levels.”\nThe RBA declined to comment.\nIn the advice released on Thursday, Treasury said the redesign “will not impact the inflation outlook”.\nInflation was projected to decline to 2.75% by June 2025, the advice shows, which would be well within the RBA’s 2% to 3% target range. The RBA will release its updated forecasts on 6 February, and may amend its prediction inflation will only slow to below 3% towards the end of 2025.\nAccording to its fiscal modelling, the tax cut rejig will boost tax receipts in the 2024-25 year by $1.3bn. This addition, though, would be reversed to produce a $1.3bn reduction in receipts in the forward estimates to 2027-28. By 2034-35, the budget would be “around $28bn” better off over the decade than if the original policy remained.\nThere will also be a “small improvement” in bracket creep for the first seven income deciles over the next 10 years. “Under the recommended redesign, average tax rates for higher-income earners are still significantly reduced compared to a no change in taxes scenario but by less than under Stage 3 [as legislated],” the advice said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMore women and those with lower formal education would also be encouraged into the workforce, the advice states.\n“Women have lower labour force participation rates and, when employed, are more likely to work part-time,” the advice notes. “When faced with the same percentage change to after-tax wages, women – particularly women with children – are more responsive in the amount they work compared to men.”\n“The redesign is expected to produce a larger increase in labour supply, driven by increases in hours worked and participation of women with taxable income between $20,000 and $75,000,” the advice states. “Overall, the recommended redesign sees an increase in labour supply of about 930,000 hours per week (0.25%), more than double Stage 3. Female labour supply is expected to increase by 0.37%.”\nJudo’s Warren said that it was important that the package was “broadly revenue neutral”.\n“It has positive implications for labour supply, for example, which people often don’t factor into their thinking about this question,” he said.\nKearns said it was clear that online interest in the tax cuts began picking up over January, with almost 10 times as many searches in the past week as in December.\nInvestors, though, don’t expect the tax changes to be significant when it comes to what the RBA decides to do with interest rates. “If the stage-three tax cuts were expected to have a significant inflationary impetus then we’d expect to see expectations for the cash rate increase relative to those for the [US] Fed Funds rate, and there isn’t evidence of that.”\nBrendan Rynne, KPMG’s chief economist said the assessment the policy changes would be “cost-neutral” was “optimistic”. His initial analysis suggested there was “a risk it could cost more than the government is assuming”.\n“The changes are likely to be marginally more inflationary than the original stage 3 proposals, due to income shifting from higher income taxpayers (who are net savers) to lower income cohorts (net spenders),” Rynne said. “Inflation is already coming down fairly quickly – business surveys are showing this ahead of official data – so the danger is that by stoking aggregate demand, cost of living pressures will continue longer.”\nKPMG estimates the total cost of the package – including the amendments – to be between 0.5%-0.7% of GDP, and so it would be stimulatory for the economy.\nLuci Ellis, Westpac’s chief economist and formerly the RBA’s head economist, said “while the changes this week alter the distribution of the benefits, the macroeconomic impact of this – relative to the package as originally announced – is marginal”.\n“We do not expect that this will affect the RBA’s view of the inflation outlook or the future path of the cash rate,” Ellis said.\n-with Paul Karp"

        "published_date": "2024-01-25T05:00:12+00:00",
        "content": "A former post office operator has come forward claiming she was told British Asian women were often pushed into theft as auditors urged her to confess to stealing £30,000 – a charge of which she was later cleared. Before her trial in 1997, it was allegedly suggested to Kuldeep Kaur Atwal, then 46, that her cultural background may have played a role in her criminality and that she was likely to receive a custodial sentence unless she admitted to stealing from her branch. A jury at Coventry crown court was subsequently instructed by the judge, Richard Cole, to return a not guilty verdict due to lack of evidence but the Post Office went on to demand that Atwal pay the money she had been falsely accused of taking. Atwal, a mother of three, whose husband, Gurpal Singh Atwal, was a teacher, was contractually obliged to make good on shortfalls and had to quickly sell her branch for a fraction of its market value to pay off the debt. Speaking to the Guardian, Atwal said the auditor’s alleged comment had made her angry at the time but she had felt powerless to respond. The Post Office apologised last year after a document was discovered in which operators were categorised as “negroid types”, “Chinese/Japanese types” and “dark-skinned European types”. Other victims have claimed that racism fuelled the prosecutions, with one claiming that he was told by a staff member that “all Indians are doing it”. Atwal said: “Looking back, I feel like saying they were bullies, to be honest. I lost my job and everybody judges you. The Post Office was so strong – everybody feared them. I felt for my husband more than anything with all the staff, all the students, looking down on him.” The accounting system Atwal had been using in her branch in Coventry was a predecessor to the infamous Horizon IT software built by Fujitsu, whose faulty returns have led to the wrongful conviction of more than 900 people. However, internal documents seen by the Guardian suggest the Post Office had also been aware of “serious problems” with the earlier system, known as Capture, prompting a series of software upgrades. One advisory note about Capture that circulated in September 1995 advised that users could continue with the latest software upgrade but the problems encountered were more significant than they had initially understood and branches risked “data corruption problems”. A “large number” of offices were said to have been affected. Kevan Jones, the Labour MP who has been prominent in the campaign for the post office operators, said he had been contacted by a number of people who believed the pre-Horizon system led to paper shortfalls in their accounts and persecution. He said: “What makes me angry is that the Post Office knew all along about the problems with Horizon, and now they are not coming clean about the pre-Horizon system. The Capture system was full of bugs and errors.” A Post Office spokesperson said: “We take very seriously the concerns raised about cases from before the Horizon system was first rolled out in 1999. We are investigating, including specific cases brought to our attention.” Atwal was accused of stealing the money over a period from July 1995 until November 1996, when Post Office auditors made a morning visit to the branch. “It was not unusual but after a couple of hours they said this branch will be closed for the rest of the day so I started thinking, ‘What’s going on?’” Atwal, 73, recalled. “They kept asking me whether I had had any accounting problems and I said, ‘No’. There had been a couple of occasions where there had been discrepancies but that was a few years back. “They said, ‘We are short of £30,000, do you suspect anyone?’ I said, ‘I don’t, no.’ They said in that case you are responsible for it. One of the auditors commented to me as they were questioning me that ‘It is quite common in your society that women come under pressure to take money on the side, they don’t tell the family. Is someone putting pressure on you?’ “He meant being an Asian woman that the culture is such that the rest of the family puts the pressure on the woman [leading to theft]. I said, ‘Don’t be silly’. I didn’t think much of the remark at the time but I was angry, to be honest.” Atwal, who had run the post office branch since 1989 without incident, said she was asked repeatedly whether anyone else in the family was involved in the business and whether she trusted her part-time staff. “They had been working with me for so many years so I did trust them,” she said. It was allegedly suggested by the auditors that if she admitted to being at fault that she may be able to avoid the harshest sanctions. Atwal was subsequently interviewed by Post Office investigators. “There was no support at all from the Post Office side, just accusation after accusation,” she said. “They kept on telling me to plead guilty, saying I would be treated leniently if I did. ‘You are otherwise definitely looking to a custodial sentence’, they said. I said, ‘I haven’t done anything, I won’t admit to it’”. Atwal appeared at Coventry crown court in August 1997. After three days of evidence, the judge said the Post Office had failed to provide any evidence of any shortfall in the accounts of agencies and clients. “They all said they had no complaints,” Atwal said. “But after the case the Post Office still wanted the money. I had no choice.”"

        "content": "Ofcom’s ideas on how to reform the postal service were so well advertised in advance that the government had rejected two of them by the time the report landed. If the prime minister “will not countenance” scrapping postal deliveries on Saturdays, then a five-day service is a non-starter and a three-day version is completely off limits for now. That, in theory – at least under this government – leaves only the surprise idea within Ofcom’s bundle: the one to slow down Royal Mail’s delivery speeds. It doesn’t have a simple name, but we could call it the “snail mail” proposal since it involves pushing the bulk of deliveries through a standard service taking “up to three days or longer”, as the regulator puts it. Urgent mail could still be delivered overnight, including for Saturdays, via a premium service that would operate outside the morning postal round – but you’d have to pay more than the current £1.25 cost of a first-class stamp.   Related: Royal Mail services may be about to change: how do other countries handle postal services?   Any good? Well, one can follow Ofcom’s thinking. The regulator starts from the position that “post users are willing to consider a slower letter service provided delivery is reliable”. One can also see the appeal for the government: it could say Saturday deliveries have been protected under a reliably slow standard model – it’s just that you’ll have to cough up if you really want an item to arrive the next day. An additional benefit for ministers, one might speculate, is that a vote in the Commons could be avoided. Unlike the five-day and three-day options, a “snail mail” reform to the current six-day-a-week Universal Service Obligation (USO) could happen just by Ofcom changing the regulations. The rest of us, though, should be deeply suspicious – and not only because of the potential lack of parliamentary scrutiny. For starters, three days “or longer” is as vague as it gets. Organisations that use the existing slow bulk service – think banks and utilities – may not notice a difference, but many small businesses would surely prefer a standard service that aims to be quicker. The Communication Workers Union is not alone in fearing we would end up with three-day-a-week deliveries by stealth.   Royal Mail has an unmatched hyper-local network that ought to be capable of delivering other services to the door   And how would a premium overnight service be priced? Weekly magazine publishers would be semi-obliged to go premium, but what would be the cost to them and their readers in terms of cover prices? The same applies to time-critical hospital appointment correspondence that can’t take a punt on three days or longer. The giveaway in Ofcom’s document was the enormously wide estimate of the net cost savings to Royal Mail under the slow-plus-premium model: £150m-£650m says details are sketchy and pricing is anybody’s guess. None of which is to deny that reform of some sort is needed. The volume of letters has fallen from 20bn to 7bn over the past 20 years and is predicted to shrink further. We are at a point where Royal Mail, even if it were managed superbly and banked every efficiency gain, would struggle to sustain the current universal service over the long-term. Many other European countries have already watered down their USO equivalents. The question is which route the UK should take. This column’s vote still goes to the five-day-a-week option as the least bad compromise. It yields the smallest savings under Ofcom’s modelling, but £100m-£200m is not small change and Royal Mail, despite it all, is still targeting a return to adjusted operating profit in the financial year that ends in March 2025. The challenge for the company is to find new sources of revenues beyond letters and parcels. Royal Mail has an unmatched hyper-local network that ought to be capable of delivering other services to the door. Five days a week looks the minimum to encourage innovation while simultaneously maintaining the “social fabric” role of Royal Mail, which also matters, not least in rural areas. Three days, or three days by stealth via “snail mail”, would be giving up."

James Bowler, the Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, was asked about Richard Hughes’s comments yesterday, and said he disagreed with them. Bowler told the Treasury Committee:  I don’t agree with what excellent head of the OBR said and I don’t agree with the language he used. There’s nothing new here. “You set out your spending plans, we have a three year spending plan, they’re due to finish in just over a year’s time and then you have an assumption as to what spending will be thereafter. “That’s not a new, nothing’s changed in that, so I don’t particularly recognise that there’s anything different. “It’s very good that we have multi-year spending plans. As you go through a multi-year spending plan as you get further towards the end of it, the closer you get to setting new plans so it is the case that in just over a year’s time that runs out, but I don’t think that’s new.”  Hughes told the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords that the OBR’s forecasts were based on “questionable assumptions” that lead people to call his efforts a work of fiction, due to a lack of support from the government about its public spending plans.

As part of the plea deal, Lewis has the right to appeal in the event he is sentenced to prison time, his lawyer David Zornow said. Lewis, whose family trust controls a majority of the Tottenham Hotspur soccer team, was charged in July 2023 with passing inside information on his portfolio companies to two of his private pilots as well as friends, personal assistants and romantic partners, enabling them, according to prosecutors, to reap millions of dollars of profit. Addressing U.S. District Judge Jessica Clarke, Lewis said he knew at the time that what he was doing was wrong. Lewis said:  “I am so embarrassed and I apologize to the court for my conduct.”  Lewis was charged with 16 counts of securities fraud last July, which he denied, accusing prosecutors of making an “egregious” mistake.

Data provider S&P Global reports that its Flash composite US PMI has risen to 52.3, from 50.9 in December, showing faster growth. But, as in the UK, the growth was driven by the services sector – while factories suffered from supply chain problems. S&P Global explains:  Businesses in the US signalled a stronger upturn in activity at the start of the year, as output growth quickened to the sharpest rate in seven months. The expansion was driven by service providers, as manufacturers continued to see a drop in production amid intensifying supply issues.   The report also shows that the prices charged by firms are rising at the slowest rate since May 2020, which may show that inflationary pressures are easing.

Asked at Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons if under his watch there will be no reductions in postal services provided by Royal Mail, Sunak said:   “I agree about the importance of the Royal Mail’s universal service obligation, and as you will have heard from the minister this morning, we remain absolutely committed to ensuring that it remains as it is.”      1.28pm GMT   Over in Argentina, the popularity of President Javier Milei’s austerity blitz will be tested today as unions stage a general strike. Bloomberg has the details:  The protest Wednesday organized by the CGT, one of the South American nation’s oldest and most powerful union groups, will help set the tenor of debate as the libertarian economist attempts to slash the size of the state in a bid to tame triple-digit inflation. “Depending on how many people they mobilize, the union will be able to demonstrate how much weight it carries at the negotiating table,” political analyst Raul Timerman said in an interview.  Milei won power last year promising a dramatic shake-up of Argentina’s moribund economy amid rampant inflation and widespread poverty.  He has already issued a decree deregulating vast swaths of the economy, while a so-called omnibus bill of austerity measures is making its way through the Argentinian parliament. Milei startled Davos last week with a fiery speech hailing free enterprise capitalism and claiming that the Western world was in danger having fallen to socialism.

Around 3,200 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year – nine women every day, according to Cancer Research UK. It says 99.8% of them are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which means that nearly every case is preventable. The UK could save £2.6bn by achieving the WHO global targets for cervical cancer by 2046, according to a report from the Office for Health Economics, which was funded by cervical vaccine maker MSD. It will be launched in parliament at 1.30pm today.   Related: ‘A golden opportunity’: screening and jabs give hope of ending cervical cancer   The World Health Organisation has set a target of four cases of per 100,000 women, by ensuring that 90% of girls are vaccinated by age 15, 70% of women between 35 and 45 are screened, and 90% of women with cancer are treated. The report said the UK would hit these targets by 2046, but warned that progress is not guaranteed, and called on governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to follow England’s lead in pledging to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. Vaccination and screening rates have worsened, according to the latest data published yesterday. This shows a one-dose coverage rate of 75.7% in year 9 girls in England, down from 82.2% in 2021/22. Of women aged 25-49, 65.8% received age-appropriate screening – down from 67.6% in 2021/22. Cervical cancer in the UK is associated with a lifetime cost of £208,086 per case.There are six licensed cervical cancer vaccines globally – MSD’s Gardasil and GSK’s Cervarix as well as jabs made in China and India. The NHS used Cervarix in the routine immunisation programme for girls aged 12-13 from September 2008; from 2012 it was replaced by Gardasil. Both vaccines protect against infection with HPV-16 and HPV-18, which cause the majority of HPV-associated cancers. Gardasil also protects against HPV-6 and -11, which cause genital warts.     12.13pm GMT  Metro Bank’s white knight moves onto the board  Metro Bank’s white knight investor – the Columbian billionaire who helped rescue the bank in early October – has clinched a seat on the lender’s board. Metro confirmed that the 65-year-old banking tycoon Jaime Gilinski Bacal would become a non-executive director, months after ploughing £100m of emergency funds into the lender in exchange a 53% stake. Metro Bank’s chair, Robert Sharpe, said:  “Jaime’s appointment underscores the commitment he has long shown to the bank as a supportive, long-term shareholder. He brings decades of banking expertise and experience which will prove invaluable on the next stage of the bank’s journey.”  As part of his rescue agreement, Bacal has been given the green light to appoint up to three directors in total to the board.  However, he already leveraged his position into a boardroom seat for his daughter Dorita Gilinski in autumn 2022. Bacal said in a statement:   “There are many opportunities for Metro Bank to grow and I am looking forward to playing a part in the evolution of the bank as we build on the solid foundational work undertaken to date.”      12.11pm GMT   Economic storm clouds are also gathering over Germany.

Ifo cited uncertainty caused bya constitutional court ruling that has left the government scrambling to revamp this year’s budget. And there could be worse ahead, if geopolitical tensions worsen. The Bundesbank has estimated today that an economic crisis in China would knock some 1.5% off German economic growth. According to its simulations, real German GDP would be 0.7% lower in the first year of the crisis and just under 1% in the second year.

Revolution Bars slashed its outlook for the year, telling shareholders that “January trade has started softly as guests recover from the expense of Christmas.” Revolution is also facing higher wage bills, with the minimum wage set to rise by almost 10% in April, while customer numbers have been hit by Aslef train strikes. Rob Pitcher, CEO of Revolution Bars Group, says last Christmas was the best in four years, adding,  It was pleasing to see our Revolution guests experience their first uninterrupted Christmas since 2019, driving growth for the brand. Revolution’s younger guests are however still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis. Looking forward, both business rates and national living wage will increase materially in April 2024 and therefore we have had to take the view that, with inflation remaining high, the recovery for the Revolution business, our largest brand, will take longer than we had previously forecast.      11.08am GMT  UK factories suffer new hit to orders, cut investment plans  Newsflash: British manufacturers have been hit with a fresh drop in orders and have scaled back their investment plans, new data from the CBI shows. The CBI’s industrial trends survey shows a contration in orders – its quarterly order book balance dropped to -13 in the three months to January, its lowest since July 2020. The survey also shows firms expect to cut back on investment in tangible assets such as buildings, machinery and equipment.  Investment intentions for the year ahead were mixed.

The spread between weak manufacturing (44.8) & strong services activity (53.8) is something of a chasm (but also a global trend).  https://t.co/8qbci7E9P5 pic.twitter.com/Ro066qdk8k— Simon French (@shjfrench) January 24, 2024      10.32am GMT   The UK PMIs point to brighter growth outlook but stubborn inflation, says ING developed markets economist James Smith.  “The UK service sector, which accounts for the lion’s share of economic output, edged further into growth in January, according to the latest purchasing manager’s index. What’s particularly interesting is that this extends a recent trend whereby UK service sector growth is apparently accelerating at a time when the equivalent eurozone index is edging further into contraction (though Europe’s manufacturing sector appears to be bottoming out). Before last autumn, the UK’s services PMI had largely tracked what was happening in its closest neighbours. This is another signal that the consensus among economists going into this year, which suggests the UK will underperform most major European economies in 2024, looks a bit too gloomy. While the recent sharp fall in market rates is good news for all economies, in the UK it makes a particular difference to the mortgage squeeze given the relatively high share of households due to refinance this year (around a fifth).      10.30am GMT  Eurozone private sector still shrinking  Over in the eurozone, business activity in the euro area fell at the slowest rate for six months in January. The eurozone Composite PMI Output Index has risen to 47.9, showing the smallest monthly contraction in six months (but below the UK’s 52.5, which showed growth). And although disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea caused eurozone supply chains to lengthen for the first time in a year, manufacturing input costs continued to fall on average, S&P Global reports.  Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.27am GMT   Today’s Flash PMI report on the UK economy (see 9.44am) shows that price pressures remain high, points out Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics. And that may worry the Bank of England, and make policymakers less keen to consider cutting interest rates. Webb explains:  The services output prices balance nudged down from 58.6 to 57.3. But that remains consistent with services CPI inflation easing only gradually from 6.4% in December to around 5.0% in about six months’ time. What’s more, the shipping disruptions in the Red Sea led to the steepest lengthening in suppliers’ delivery times since September 2022 and caused the input prices balance of the manufacturing PMI to rise from 47.5 to 53.5, to its highest level since March 2023.  The further small rise in the composite activity PMI, from 52.1 in December to 52.5 in January, suggests that “the economy has improved”, Webb adds.     9.44am GMT  UK factories hit by Red Sea crisis, but recession could be avoided  Newsflash: the Red Sea crisis is hitting UK manufacturing supply chains and pushing up input costs. Data firm S&P Global reports that its flash UK Manufacturing Output Index, which tracks factory production, has fallen to a three-month low of 44.9. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction. S&P Global’s survey of UK purchasing managers has found that manufacturing supply chains suffered from longer wait times for container freight during January in the wake of the Red Sea crisis. With supplies taking longer to arrive, firms have been running down their inventories. S&P Global explains:  Supplier delays were overwhelmingly linked to longer international shipping times as vessels rerouted away from the Suez Canal. At the same time, preproduction inventories fell to the greatest extent since last August as safety stocks were depleted.  These longer delivery times are adding to costs, with S&P Global predicting UK inflation will remain “stubbornly higher” in the 3-4% range in the near future (it rose to 4% in December). The better news is that services companies are growing at the fastest rate in eight months, with the UK Services PMI rising to 53.8. That helped the wider recovery in private sector output gains momentum in January, lifting the overall UK PMI Composite to a seven-month high of 52.5. That should help the economy avoid recession, they say.  💥 flash UK #PMI composite output index (manufacturing and services) rose again in January to 52.5 (December 52.1), a 7-month high... 👍Touch and go whether the UK avoided a technical '#recession' in the second half of last year, but 2024 already looking a lot brighter 🤓 pic.twitter.com/EnvRB4oDHK— Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) January 24, 2024  Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said:  “UK business activity growth accelerated for a third straight month in January, according to early PMI survey data, marking a promising start to the year. The survey data point to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.2% after a flat fourth quarter, therefore skirting recession and showing signs of renewed momentum. Businesses have also become more optimistic about the year ahead, with confidence rebounding to its highest since last May. Business activity and confidence are being in part driven by hopes of faster economic growth in 2024, in turn linked to the prospect of falling inflation and commensurately lower interest rates.   Updated at 10.02am GMT    9.09am GMT  Shares in IDS keep rising  Shares in Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services, have now jumped 3.4% in London, as traders ponder the savings it could make from fewer deliveries. That’re up 9p at 270p, adding to their earlier gains. Royal Mail shares floated at 330p in 2013, and swiftly surged over 500p. But they’ve had a choppy ride since, hitting record lows below 120p early in the pandemic before receiving a boost from parcel demand. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that there is opposition to Ofcom’s suggested improvements to the Royal Mail universal service obligation:  Royal Mail has long had its calls to scrap the government’s USO rejected. Now it looks like the tide could potentially be turning. Although there is still considerable opposition including from the Communication Workers Union (CWU) which argues a three day service would ‘destroy’ the company, as well as the Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake who said the government is committed to a six-day service. The company owned by International Distribution Services, has been facing a series of painful setbacks like the postal strikes, a fine from Ofcom for missing delivery targets and a cyber security incident. It has also been struggling with heavy operating losses on the back of a long-term structural decline in letter demand and the loss of its 360-year-old monopoly on delivery parcels from Post Office branches. Ofcom said letter volumes have halved since 2011, raising existential concerns about the future of Royal Mail and prompting calls for a drastic overhaul of the business to revitalise its finances and operations to ensure it doesn’t become ‘unsustainable.’ Shares in IDS are trading higher today reflecting optimism towards the regulator’s openness towards change at the embattled postal business. But shares are still sharply lower than the recent highs seen in 2021 during covid.”      8.55am GMT   Shares in easyJet have jumped 5%, despite the budget airline taking a £40m hit from the conflict in the Middle East. EasyJet reported that there was a temporary slowdown in flight bookings for the wider industry after the 7 October attacks, as well as an ongoing pause on flights to Israel and Jordan. But, it says, demand and bookings have recovered strongly from late November. This allowed it to narrow its pre-tax loss in the last quarter, to £126m, from £133m in October-December 2022.     8.51am GMT   Over in China, policymakers are cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in their reserves, to stimulate the economy. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has announce it will cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) from 5 February. This is the first RRR cut this year, and should free up 1 trillion yuan (£110bn) to support lending. China’s stock markets rose today, with the CSI 300 index up 1.4%. Mining stocks are rallying in London too.     8.36am GMT  Minister: Fujitsu should pay hundreds of millions of pounds compensation over UK Post Office scandal  Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, believes Japanese IT firm Fujitsu should pay “hundreds of millions of pounds” in compensation for its role in the Post Office scandal. Speaking to the Today programme, Hollinrake said:  This will cost the taxpayer a billion pounds, maybe more than that.  He added that Fujitsu, which supplied the flawed Horizon software, should pay “a significant proportion” of that bill. Last week, Fujitsu Europe’s boss admitted the firm has a “moral obligation” to contribute to compensation for sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted due to Horizon reporting that money was missing from their branches. The inquiry into Horizon also heard last week that some Horizone bugs were known about as early as 1999, but this information was kept from the courts.   Related: Post Office: ‘appalling’ that courts not told of bugs, Fujitsu boss admits   Hollinrake says what has happened is “absolutely disgraceful” and a “horrendous scandal”, in terms of both its scale and depth, and the impact on people’s lives.     8.20am GMT  Abrdn to cut 500 jobs in cost-cutting drive  There’s bad news for workers at asset manager Abrdn this morning. Abrdn is stepping up its cost-cutting programme, and today announced it will strip out another £150m of costs in 2024 and 2025, mainly across its group functions and support services. The plan will eliminate around 500 jobs. Abrdn says:  The programme includes the removal of management layers, increasing spans of control, further efficiency in outsourcing and technology areas, as well as reducing overheads in group functions and support services.      8.14am GMT   Citizens Advice are calling for proposals to tackle the causes of Royal Mail’s “persistent failings”. Morgan Wild, interim director of policy at Citizens Advice, says simply cutting services won’t automatically make deliveries more reliable:   “Given Royal Mail has failed to meet its targets for nearly half a decade, it’s clear the current Universal Service Obligation (USO) is falling short of its fundamental purpose: safeguarding consumers. Any changes must prioritise their needs, not Royal Mail’s bottom line.  “We agree that improving reliability is essential. Late post has real consequences - people miss vital medical appointments, legal documents and benefit decisions.  “Cutting services won’t automatically make letter deliveries more reliable, so we must see proposals to tackle the cause of Royal Mail’s persistent failings. Ofcom and the government have to spell out how any revised USO will start to deliver for the millions of us who rely on it.”       8.03am GMT  Shares in Royal Mail parent company IDS rise  Shares in International Distributions Services, Royal Mail’s parent company, rose by 1.8% at the start of trading in London, as traders digest Ofcom’s report into its USO.     7.59am GMT    'No action is not really an option'Dame Melanie Dawes, from regulator OFCOM, spoke to #BBCBreakfast about a consultation on the future of the Royal Mail which could reduce the number of letter deliveries from six per week to five or three insteadhttps://t.co/ZQirTB8I67 pic.twitter.com/yBtskhu0pl— BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) January 24, 2024      7.57am GMT  CWU: three-day delivery service would “destroy” Royal Mail  The Communication Workers Union (CWU) have said a three-day delivery service would “destroy” Royal Mail. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said the union could not support such a plan:  “We are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact on thousands of jobs. “Royal Mail has the biggest fleet in the country, a presence in every community, and boasts and unrivalled infrastructure. “This is the bedrock that a serious growth agenda, and the future of the company, can be built.”      7.52am GMT   Ofcom CEO Dame Melanie Dawes is on Radio 4’s Today Programme now, to discuss the regulator’s report into Royal Mail’s Universal Service Obligation. Q: Why should politicians make Royal Mail’s job easier? They’re failing to meet their current targets, and have terrible industrial relations…. Dawes agrees that Royal Mail is not delivering. It needs to improve their quality of service. But there’s also been a “huge shift” in the postal markets, with letter volumes falling and parcel demand rising. We have to respond to that, Dawes says, otherwise the service becomes too expensive, or worse, unsustainable. Q: Are you saying that Royal Mail could go bust if their obligations don’t change? Dawes replies that Royal Mail is currently loss-making, and has a big transformation ahead. She adds that Ofcom fined them £5.5m, just before Christmas, because of their poor service (missing delivery targets). Dawes adds:  We will remain absolutely vigilient in making sure they deliver what they are supposed to do at the moment.  But the regulator is also identifying where change is needed in the future, and wants to have a debate about this. Q: So, Royal Mail could scrap Saturday deliveries, and maybe other days as well? Dawes says some other countries already have an every-other-day service. But that needs to be combined with a really good overnight service, for deliveries that are urgent. Dawes says she isn’t proposing a third class of service, on top of 1st and 2nd class – (implying, I think, that 1st class would be a guaranteed overnight delivery).     7.27am GMT  Post minister: We are committed to six-day service  Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Government was committed to a six-day service from the Royal Mail (as flagged earlier). Speaking after Ofcom suggested letter delivery days could be cut to five, or even three, Hollinrake told Times Radio:  “The Prime Minister been very clear on this, six-day delivery is really important for many people in this country, many of our citizens, but also for many of our businesses.”    Related: Royal Mail’s Saturday letter service should stay, says Downing Street   Questioned over whether the six-day model for letters remained sustainable, Hollinrake said:  “Royal Mail made significant profits in previous years. They’ve had a couple of difficult years not least because of some of the industrial action they’ve been subjected to. But nevertheless we are keen to see Royal Mail become more efficient.”  He added:  “I believe the Royal Mail can build a sustainable model. But that sustainable model must be based on a-six day service.”   Updated at 7.28am GMT    7.18am GMT   The UK’s Communication Workers Union says Ofcom’s report into the Royal Mail’s Universal Service Obligation is “completely dead in the water”. The CWU is planning to produce its own report on the future of Royal Mail: CWU general secretary Dave Ward says:  “The response to the leaked information over the week showed that CWU members, the public and politicians are united against the deliberate, manufactured destruction of the postal service. “In the ongoing debate, Ofcom now have no credibility whatsoever, and their views are an irrelevance to the discussion that must take place between postal workers, businesses and customers. “To produce a report without any input whatsoever from frontline workers or their union is an attempt to railroad through the failed agenda of the previous Royal Mail management team. “The CWU will not stand for that. We will now launch an extensive engagement exercise and produce our own report on the future of Royal Mail, taking on board the views of our members and customers. “This will be a blueprint for a sustainable Royal Mail that can grow our economy and our communities.      7.16am GMT  Full story: Royal Mail could save £650m by switching to three-day-a week service, says Ofcom  Royal Mail could save up to £650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and £200m by stopping Saturday deliveries, the communications regulator has said (see 6.52am). The watchdog said a reduction from six to five days a week would save £100m to £200m, and going down to three days £400m to £650m, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. In a much-anticipated review, Ofcom laid out a series of options for the future of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver nationwide, six days a week, for a fixed price. The regulator began gathering evidence to show how the future of the service may be reformed to better suit consumers’ needs, amid a long-term decline in letter volumes and a surge in the number of parcels sent as online shopping has grown. It has conducted consumer research and modelled Royal Mail’s finances in the review, and will seek views with a further update planned later this year. More here:   Related: Royal Mail could save £650m by switching to three-day-a week service, says Ofcom        7.10am GMT   Ofcom want to hear your views to its suggestion that Royal Mail could deliver letters slower, or less often. The regulator is inviting views from interested parties by 3 April 2024, to understand the potential impact on people and businesses. This includes vulnerable people, those in rural and remote areas of the UK’s nations, as well as large organisations who use bulk mail services. Ofcom will hold events around the country to discuss the evidence and options, and after considering feedback it will provide an update in the summer.     7.04am GMT  Ofcom CEO: USO is unsustainable if we don’t take action.  Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, says:  “Postal workers are part of the fabric of our society and are critical to communities up and down the country. But we’re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels. The universal service hasn’t changed since then, it’s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don’t take action. “So we’ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we’re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of Second Class stamps.”      7.03am GMT   Ofcom argues that most people’s needs could still be met if Royal Mail delivered letters less often. Having conducted market research, it says:   Nine in 10 people (88%) say reliability is important for letter deliveries, compared to 58% for delivery on Saturdays (down from 63% in 2020).[7] Most participants in our research were also open to reducing some services and standards – particularly for letters – in the interests of keeping prices down and only paying for what was required. Similarly, there was strong acknowledgement that most letters were not urgent, but people still needed to have a faster service available for the occasional urgent items, even if that meant paying a premium for it.      7.01am GMT   What about a possible subsidy for Royal Mail, as some other countries provide? Ofcom reckons it’s preferable to change the specification of the universal service, rather than using taxpayer funds to maintain the existing levels of service and products. Ultimately this is a decision for Government, it adds.     6.58am GMT  Ofcom:  delivery targets should not be downgraded  Ofcom is also not proposing downgrading Royal Mail’s delivery targets – saying this is not an option for reform.  It adds:  In fact, it will be important to consider whether additional safeguards are necessary to ensure people’s needs are fully met. Any changes must improve existing levels of reliability.      6.55am GMT  Ofcom: Royal Mail could save £650m by cutting deliveries to 3 days a week.  Ofcom estimates that Royal Mail could achieve a net cost saving of £100m-£200m if letter deliveries were reduced to five days; and £400m-£650m if reduced to three days. If the large majority of letters were delivered within three days, it could achieve net cost savings of £150m-£650m, the regulator adds.     6.52am GMT  Ofcom review released: \"Universal postal service must modernise\"  NEWSFLASH: Ofcom is calling for the UK’s universal postal service to modernise, as it publishes its review of Royal Mail’s universal service obligation (see opening post). The regulator is inviting views on a range of options for redesigning the universal postal service to secure its future, while ensuring it reflects the way people use it. Ofcom points out that letter volumes have halved since 2011. And it says options for reform include changing letter delivery speed or the number of delivery days, as other countries have done, but not downgrading delivery targets. That could include cutting letter deliveries to just three days a week! Ofcom says it is proposing two primary options:  Making changes to existing First and Second Class and business products so that most letters are delivered through a service taking up to three days or longer, with a next-day service still available for any urgent letters. Reducing the number of letter delivery days in the service from six to five or three. This would require Government and Parliament to change primary legislation.   Updated at 7.28am GMT    6.44am GMT   Ofcom does not have the power to scrap Saturday letter deliveries, as the six-days-a-week service is part of the universal service requirement stipulated by law under the Postal Services Act 2011. Changing the obligation would require primary legislation, and a vote by MPs in the Commons.     6.36am GMT   Ahead of Ofcom’s announcement, my colleague Alex Lawson has examined how other countries run their own postal operations:   Related: Royal Mail services may be about to change: how do other countries handle postal services?       6.34am GMT  IDS chair: Royal Mail’s universal service needs help to survive  The chair of Royal Mail’s parent company says its universal service “needs help to survive”. Keith Williams, chairman of International Distributions Services, argues against “nostalgia for a bygone era” when assessing the future of Royal Mail. Writing in The Times this morning, Williams says there needs to be an “honest conversation” about how to protect the one-price-goes-anywhere postal service. He says:  The number of letters we deliver has fallen from 20 billion to 7 billion. We only deliver about four letters per address, per week. This means we have to walk more than three times as far to deliver the same number of letters as we did before, increasing the cost per letter of each delivery.  Williams warns that Royal Mail is currently “stuck in a vicious spiral” – without reform of the regulatory system, or a subsidy – leading to “heavy losses and an unsustainable service”. And on the possibility of Saturday letter deliveries being scrapped, Williams says there are other options… He says:  There has been a lot of discussion about dropping letter deliveries on a Saturday, while retaining daily parcel deliveries, to tackle the problem of declining letter volumes and Royal Mail’s material financial losses. The truth is there are a range of other options, including ways we can ensure a reliable service for time-critical mail such as hospital appointments and weekly magazines.   Updated at 6.36am GMT    6.27am GMT  Introduction: Regulator to report on potential Royal Mail reforms  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial market and the world economy. Royal Mail’s future is in the spotlight today, with UK communications regulator Ofcom expected to release the findings of its review into its universal service obligation (USO). Currently, Royal Mail is legally obliged to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week, for a fixed price, something the postal operator insists is unaffordable. Ofcom’s review will outline various options for the future of the USO, reflecting changes in the postal market as letter volumes fall, and parcel demand rises thanks to online shopping. Possible changes to the legal requirements of the British postal service could include changing its first and second class delivery targets (which it has strugggled to hit), or higher stamp prices. It’s also possible Ofcom could recomment changing the current six-day USO, paving the way for the axing of letter deliveries on a Saturday. That should please Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services, which warned last week that the six-day USO was ‘simply not sustainable‘. But that would be controversial, not least with prime minister Rishi Sunak. Earlier this week, Sunak’s spokesman said the PM “will not countenance” scrapping postal deliveries on Saturday, as they provide “flexibility and convenience” for customers and are “important for businesses and particularly publishers”.   Related: Royal Mail’s Saturday letter service should stay, says Downing Street   Ofcom itself has said its review will set out evidence and options on “how the universal postal service might need to evolve to more closely meet consumer needs”. They added:  “We will be inviting views on this, not consulting on specific proposals. “It would ultimately be for the UK government and parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service.”    Related: Ofcom to set out possible Royal Mail reforms – and Saturday deliveries could end   The agenda  7am: Ofcom expected to publish its review into the Royal Mail’s universal service 9am GMT: Eurozone flash PMI report into company growth in January 9.30am GMT: UK flash PMI report into company growth in January 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey of UK manufacturing   Updated at 6.34am GMT "

        "content": "Royal Mail could save up to £650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and £200m by stopping Saturday deliveries, the communications regulator has said in its much-anticipated review of the postal service. Ofcom laid out a series of options for the future of the universal service obligation (USO) – which requires Royal Mail to deliver countrywide, six days a week for a fixed price – including saving an estimated £100m-£200m by going from six to five days a week, or cutting costs by £400m-£650m with a reduction to three days. The regulator began gathering evidence last year to show how the future of the service might be changed to better suit consumers’ needs, amid a long-term decline in letter volumes and a surge in the number of parcels sent as online shopping has grown.  Interactive  Ofcom said there was an increasing risk that Royal Mail would become “financially and operationally unsustainable in the long term” given the cost of delivering the USO. Ofcom stressed it was not recommending specific proposals, but said the two “primary options” on the table were cuts to the number of letter delivery days, or changes that could mean making first- and second-class deliveries take up to three days or longer. That would be accompanied by a next-day service for urgent letters, it said. The first option would require parliamentary approval, but the second change is within the regulator’s gift. Ofcom has conducted consumer research and modelled Royal Mail’s finances in the review, and will now seek views from interested parties until 3 April. In consumer polling for Ofcom, 88% of respondents said reliability was important for letter deliveries. This compared with 58% who said a Saturday service was important, down from 63% when research was last conducted in 2020. Royal Mail has long pushed to be allowed to cut Saturday deliveries, but the government rejected the proposal last year. It emerged last weekend that the move was being studied, and Downing Street indicated it would oppose such a plan. Rishi Sunak reiterated that stance on Wednesday, saying the government was “absolutely committed to ensuring that [the USO] remains as it is”. Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), said: “We have been calling on government and Ofcom to tackle this issue for four years, and the lack of action means that we are now facing a much more serious situation. “While other countries have grasped the opportunity to change, the UK is being left behind. There has been a lot of discussion about dropping Saturday letter deliveries in the UK, but as other countries have shown, there are a range of options to consider.” In a letter last week to the Commons business and trade committee chair, the Labour MP Liam Byrne, Seidenberg wrote that the USO was “unsustainable” in its current form, and cited similar changes in other European countries. On Wednesday, Byrne said: “Let’s be absolutely clear: the USO is a vital public service, which is why we’ve called for government to get serious about talks with Royal Mail to agree a plan to secure its future.”   Related: Royal Mail hails best Christmas for four years – but staff miss £500 bonus    Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “We are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact on thousands of jobs.”  Tina McKenzie, the policy and advocacy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “Trading essential services for short-term savings is a slippery slope that may compromise the trust small businesses place in Royal Mail.” The Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: “This feels like a slap in the face for so many who already have the pain of delayed deliveries.” It had been speculated that Ofcom could suggest state subsidies for Royal Mail, but that option was not contained in the review. The company was privatised in 2013, with the government’s final stake sold in 2015. Shares in IDS rose by 4% on Wednesday morning after the review’s publication. Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom, said: “We’re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels. The universal service hasn’t changed since then; it’s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don’t take action. “So, we’ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we’re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of second-class stamps.”"

        "content": "It is fair to say I have not taken a neutral position on the stage-three tax cuts. After all, back in 2022 I was the guy who wrote: “The stage-three tax cuts are a pile of garbage, and everybody knows it.”\nI distinctly remember the 2018 budget lock-up when the cuts first appeared. My jaw hit the floor when I realised the government was not only contemplating introducing a flat income tax, but was so brazen it hadn’t even provided any costings. \nWhen the costings finally arrived (some four years later), they were big. The latest estimate released by the Parliamentary Budget Office this week estimated the cuts would cost $20.7bn in the first year.\n\n Related: Labor MPs endorse changes to stage-three tax cuts \n\nBut things got really ugly when you looked at who would have received most of the stage-three tax cuts. More than half ($11.2bn) was going to people earning more than $150,000 a year. All up, just over three-quarters of the cuts would benefit the richest 20%.\nWe were told the cuts would end bracket creep (they wouldn’t, given bracket creep affects low- and middle-income earners more than high-income earners). We were told the cuts would fire up productivity and participation (they wouldn’t, given the biggest tax cut was going to those on $200,000, and whose marginal tax rate of 45% wasn’t going to change at all).\nAnd now they are gone.\nStage three is dead. Long live stage three new … better … improved … fairer?\nThe details are yet to be officially announced and even since this column was first published different things have been confirmed to the media. I’ve updated some of the dollar figures and graphs a few hours after publication to reflect the new details as they’ve become public.\nVarious media reports suggest the end result will be to:\n\nreduce the lowest tax rate from 19% to 16%. The key aspect of this is unlike the stage-three tax cut, this means people earning less than $45,000 will get a tax cut of up to $804.\nreduce the 32.5% tax rate to 30% (this is the same as the old stage three).\nincrease the 37% tax threshold from $120,000 to $135,000.\nincrease the 45% tax threshold from $180,000 to $190,000 (the old stage would have increased this to $200,00).\n\nSo what does this look like? First, the dollar amount of tax cuts:\n \n\nIf the graph does not display click here\nThe median annual earnings for all Australian workers is now $67,600 – that is, half of our workers earn more and half earn less than that figure. This is the true “middle Australian worker”. They will be $804 better off under the new stage three than the old one – a $1,369 tax cut compared with $565.\nThe PBO estimates that 90% of income earners earn less than $153,000. Given that the new stage three is better for those earning less than $146,500 you can pretty confidently say that 85% of income earners are better off under this new stage-three arrangement.\nThat’s a pretty potent political weapon.\nBut now let’s look at the cut as a percentage of income.\n \n\nIf the graph does not display click here\nThose on the minimum wage of about $45,000, those on median earnings and even those on average full-time earnings of just under $100,000 all get much the same tax cut as do those on $200,000. The only bump is for those earning between $120,000 and $135,000 who get the benefit of the increased threshold.\nAnd when we look at the share of the benefits, the new stage three gives more to the bottom nine income deciles (the lowest 90%). It does this by massively reducing the total amount going to the top 10%.\n \n\nIf the graph does not display click here\nThe final result is a tax system that is much more progressive than would have been the case under the old stage-three cuts:\n \n\nIf the graph does not display click here\nThe political fight will obviously be about breaking an election promise. But that can only get the Coalition so far. Complaining that because Labor broke a promise 90% of people are going to be better off is rather unconvincing.\nDo they really think people on median and average incomes will be angry they are getting a bigger tax cut?\n\n Related: Stage-three tax cut changes will have minimal effect on inflation, economists predict \n\nThe bigger story is one of policy. Labor has a tax policy its members and ministers will be proud of. No longer will they have to cower. This is a Labor tax policy done by a government that looks as though it wants to be in charge.\nI always argued against these tax cuts because they produced a less fair economy, which leads to a less fair Australia. I criticised Labor when it promised to keep the cuts. It was a bad policy whoever implemented the cuts.\nThe government is right to dump them and come up with something better for the economy, and the country.\n\nGreg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work\nThis article was updated on January 25, 2024 to reflect changes in the dollar amounts of tax cuts after it was confirmed the tax-free threshold would not be raised.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Fund manager abrdn has said it plans to keep paying bonuses despite slashing 500 jobs and outsourcing more work as part of a £150m cost-cutting drive designed to boost profits. The investment company is cutting jobs at head office and in its back office support teams but said that frontline staff who deal with clients would not be at risk. The fund manager aims to strip out layers of middle management to simplify its complex internal structure. However, chief executive Stephen Bird said that the group would continue paying bonuses to staff this year, saying it was important to recognise “performing colleagues”. Meanwhile, it plans to outsource more jobs carried out by staff internally. Bird scrapped the Standard Life Aberdeen brand for its new name, abrdn, two years ago in a move which was described as “ill-thought out”. The company said the bulk of overall savings will come from cutting a number of “non-staff costs”, which could include off-loading some of its properties, including office space and renegotiating contracts with suppliers. The cost-cutting programme is expected to take until the end of 2025. Details of the latest bonus pot will be revealed on 27 February when abrdn releases its annual results. The company paid out £85m in bonuses for 2022, though that was down from £126m a year earlier. The CEO’s bonus was slashed by 62.4% due to not hitting profit and flows targets. Affected abrdn staff, who are not unionised, are expected to be axed by the end of 2024. The overhaul follows a “root and branch review” of the Edinburgh-based company, which said that its cost-cutting programme would help shift resources and restore its investment business to “an acceptable level of profitability” over the next two years.  The British asset manager suffered £12.4bn of net outflows in the second half of 2023, which the group partly blamed on high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty that had pushed clients to take safer bets. “Market conditions have remained challenging for our mix of business, and this is reflected in our year-end AUMA [assets under management and administration], flow numbers, and margins,” Bird said in a statement. “The board and I are committed to taking these significant cost actions now to restore our core investments business to a more acceptable level of profitability.” The share price initially dropped sharply, before recovering to rise by nearly 4% by midday today."

        "content": "Eurostar traffic returned to pre-Covid levels with a 22% rise in passenger numbers in 2023, the cross-Channel train operator has announced. Eurostar also said it had found a partial solution to allow it to maintain a limited service to the Netherlands during work at Amsterdam station, which had threatened to halt the popular route in 2024. Booming demand from London drove growth of 25% for journeys to Paris and more than a third on Eurostar routes to Brussels and Amsterdam, as total passenger numbers reached 18.9 million. Eurostar, which merged with Franco-Belgian high-speed operator Thalys in 2022, said it was “strongly on [its] way” to reach a stated target of 30 million passengers by 2030. Gwendoline Cazenave, the chief executive of Eurostar, said the company “achieved exceptionally strong growth in 2023. We carried almost 8 million passengers between London and France, 1.1 million between the Netherlands and the UK and 2.2 million to Belgium. “Our goal is to encourage more people to take the train so it’s a win for customers and a win for the planet.”   Related: Spanish rail firm planning London to Paris service to rival Eurostar   Its terminal at Amsterdam Centraal is due to close for six months from June but Eurostar will continue to run three direct trains from London, although only with slower services connecting at Brussels on the way back. Passenger numbers from the city have been severely limited due to UK border requirements and lack of space, which has worsened since Brexit, but Eurostar hopes for a big capacity increase when work is finished. Cazenave said Amsterdam was a “key hub”, adding: “The construction of a new terminal is vital for passengers, who will be able to increase their numbers significantly when it opens.” Eurostar services will be particularly in demand this summer when it expects to carry close to 2 million passengers to Paris for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The growth in passengers underlines Eurostar’s recovery since the pandemic, when travel restrictions saw it teeter on the edge of bankruptcy with only one train running each day. However, it has yet to reopen a number of stations, including Ashford and Ebbsfleet in Kent, and its network of direct routes remains limited. It may also face competition for the first time across the Channel, with the tunnel operator Getlink indicating that it has been in talks with a number of startups that wish to run high-speed trains."

        "content": "UK factories entered the new year cutting production and investment in a sign that rising tensions in the Red Sea are harming the ability of manufacturers to end almost a year of contraction. Factory owners reported import price rises and delays to exports that forced them to reduce output in January for an 11th consecutive month, according to a leading business survey. However, the UK’s dominant services sector expanded by more than expected, improving the overall outlook for the British economy. Investors reacted to the survey by pushing the pound higher in the expectation that interest rates would stay higher for longer. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee meets on Thursday next week and there is the prospect it could signal that inflationary pressures from stronger growth warrant a delay in the first cut to interest rates. The pound climbed to $1.27 and interest rate futures showed investors continued to expect four quarter-point cuts in 2024, but with less conviction than earlier in the day. Chris Williamson, chief business economist of S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the purchasing managers’ index (PMI), said: “Business activity and confidence are being in part driven by hopes of faster economic growth in 2024, in turn linked to the prospect of falling inflation and commensurately lower interest rates. “However, the surprising strength of growth in January, which has exceeded forecasts, may deter the Bank of England from cutting interest rates as soon as many are expecting, especially as supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.” The preliminary reading for the S&P Global/CIPS UK composite PMI, which spans both services and manufacturing companies, rose to 52.5 in January, its highest level in seven months and up from December’s final figure of 52.1. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly smaller increase to 52.2. A jump in the services index to 53.8 offset a 47.3 figure for the manufacturing sector and a three-month drop to 44.9 for manufacturing output. A separate survey by the business lobby group the CBI showed on Wednesday that manufacturers were on the back foot going into 2024 with total new orders falling at their fastest pace since July 2020 after an index balance slumped from +2 in October to -13 in the three months to January. Shipping costs had fallen steeply from early December, according to the Baltic Dry index which tracks the cost of shipping bulk dry goods and is a leading economic indicator. However, that has risen sharply in recent weeks after attacks by Houthi rebels on container ships passing through the Red Sea. Export sales remained a weak spot, said Williamson, with a sustained decline in the manufacturing sector offsetting modest growth in the service economy. The S&P survey found that falling inflation in the UK and a reduction in borrowing costs put services companies in a better mood and more willing to hire staff. The recovery in Britain’s services sector contrasts with weakness in the eurozone, where the composite PMI of 47.9 remained in negative territory in January and was fractionally below analysts’ forecasts. “The issue for the Bank of England is that inflation is also proving sticky, and the PMI highlights the disruption in the Red Sea,” said James Smith, economist at financial services firm ING. “Today’s data adds to the case for the Bank of England to wait a little longer before cutting rates. We expect a cut in August.”"

        "content": "The government has handed energy companies £22bn in billpayer-backed subsidies to burn wood for electricity despite being unable to prove the industry meets sustainability standards, the government’s spending watchdog has said. The head of the National Audit Office (NAO) has called on the government to rethink how it monitors compliance with its biomass sustainability regime, which has handed about £1bn a year to generators, because the assurances do not provide confidence that the environmental requirements have been met. Last week, the government put forward controversial plans to offer Britain’s biggest biomass generator, the Drax plant in North Yorkshire, extra subsidies to burn trees for electricity until the end of the decade. Biomass has provided about a 10th of UK electricity in recent years. It is considered a key plank in the government’s plan to reduce emissions from electricity to near zero by 2035. Many green campaigners, scientists and MPs are fiercely opposed to burning wood pellets that they claim damages natural ecosystems and increases carbon emissions. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “If biomass is going to play a key role in the transition to net zero, the government needs to be confident that the industry is meeting high sustainability standards. “However, government has been unable to demonstrate its current assurances are adequate to provide confidence in this regard … Government must review the assurance arrangements for these schemes, including ensuring that it has provided adequate resources to give it assurance over the billions of pounds involved.” Drax stands to earn an extra £2bn in subsidies under the government’s plan to extend subsidies to the power plant beyond the end of the scheme in 2027. The government has also granted permission for Drax to fit carbon capture technology to biomass plant, in a project that could cost billpayers an estimated £40bn. The government’s biomass sustainability monitoring relies on a combination industry-backed data, third-party certifications and some assurance audit reports. The NAO has suggested the government should devote more resources to ensure that energy companies are being compliant. Matt Williams, an advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US-based environmental group, said the NAO’s findings suggest “billions of billpayer cash could have been used to cause environmental damage”, adding that extending Drax’s subsidies in these circumstances was unjustifiable. Selaine Saxby, the Conservative MP for North Devon, said: “Since we first decided to subsidise energy generation from woody biomass, as part of the transition from coal, it has become clear that the science on the technology has changed. “Far more sustainable options have now been developed and improved, such as solar, wind and nuclear power generation, and I call on the government to support these technologies over biomass energy generation.” A spokesperson for the government said its sustainability criteria was in line with internationally recognised standards, and it would be consulting later this year on how the UK could go further."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-24T09:20:59+00:00",
        "content": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has been accused of “gross hypocrisy” as it prepares to open a new blast furnace in India, while citing a cut in carbon emissions for its decision to close two blast furnaces in south Wales, costing thousands of jobs. Tata announced last week that up to 2,800 jobs would be cut  under plans to close Port Talbot’s two huge blast furnaces and replace them with an electric arc furnace. However, union bosses told the Guardian the decision was at odds with a project to build a huge new blast furnace at Tata’s Kalinganagar industrial complex in eastern India, which is entering its closing stages. The job cuts have inflamed tensions between unions and the government, which steelworkers argue should have offered greater financial aid to the company to support domestic manufacturing. On Tuesday, workers gathered outside Westminster to protest against the decision, while Labour vowed to force a vote on the future of the British steel industry. In announcing the redundancies last week, the company said that the overhaul would “secure most of Tata Steel UK’s existing product capability and maintain the country’s self-sufficiency in steelmaking, while also reducing Tata Steel UK’s CO2 emissions by 5 million tonnes per year and overall UK country emissions by about 1.5%”. However, the project at Kalinganagar could increase the company’s overall global emissions. It will be among the largest blast furnaces in the world, with a 5,870 cubic metre capacity, and is due to be completed this year. Unions argue that building a new blast furnace while claiming an emissions cut in Wales represents double standards. The Indian site already houses a vast blast furnace, with a capacity of 4,330 cubic metres, which the company has lauded as the “backbone of steelmaking” at the plant. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “Tata’s actions in India expose the myth that its plan to close the blast furnaces in Port Talbot is due to concerns about climate change. It is nothing of the sort. Tata is simply seeking to boost its global profits. “That’s why much-needed public investment in green steel should come with job guarantees and a plan for growth.” The Welsh job cuts have been more than a decade in the making, as Britain’s steel industry has struggled to compete with cheaper Chinese imports and European rivals with lower energy costs. Long-running negotiations over government subsidies eventually resulted in Tata announcing a £1.25bn investment, including £500m from the taxpayer, to switch to an electric arc furnace, which uses electricity to melt scrap metal rather than burning coal and iron ore. But that will be far less labour intensive, resulting in 2,500 jobs being cut at Port Talbot and another 300 at another south Wales site, in Llanwern. Semi-finished steel slabs will be imported from sites in India and the Netherlands before the EAF is operational in 2027. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a GMB national officer, said: “This gross hypocrisy is exactly what GMB has been talking about – Tata’s plan is centred on importing steel from their plants in India and IJmuiden while the electric arc furnace is built – and beyond.  “This transition being ‘green’ is a false flag, allowing foreign entities to profit off the back of GMB members and their communities.” India has been far less proactive than Europe in tackling company emissions and its steel industry is reliant on coal. Britain’s more stringent approach to tackling emissions, and the country’s abundance of scrap steel to feed EAFs, have set the two countries’ industries apart, sources said. The site has also been trialling carbon capture technology and the new blast furnace will have its own gas cleaning plant and a “robust dust extraction system”. Tata has expanded Kalinganagar – a new town built up in the face of local tribal resistance and taking advantage of iron ore reserves in Tomka – to become one of the most important assets in its global portfolio. In the early 2000s, a government agency began buying land from the public and courting international steel companies to open operations in coastal Odisha. The site, sandwiched between the crocodile-filled waters of the Bhitarkanika national park and the Tomka iron ore mountain, is one of four huge Tata steelworks in India (including its powerhouse Jamshedpur site). Tata faced opposition from local villagers intent on receiving compensation and rehousing in return for their ancestral lands. The situation came to a head in January 2006, when police opened fire on a group of tribal people protesting against the construction of a boundary wall of the plant on land grazed by cattle, with 13 Adivasi people and a policeman killed. A memorial is held each year. A Tata Steel spokesperson said: “We understand how difficult this decision is for our workers and our steel communities ... We believe that scrap-based steelmaking is the right solution for our business in the UK – a country which is currently the second largest exporter of used steel in the world, and one in which renewable energy is developing quickly.”"

        "content": "Conflicts in the Middle East have cost easyJet more than £40m as a result of flight suspensions and weakening demand, the airline has said. The company said that, while its year-on-year results had improved, the conflicts in Gaza and the Middle East had hit trading. In the days after the 7 October attacks in Israel, easyJet was one of a number of carriers that paused flights to Israel and nearby Jordan for safety reasons. These flights have yet to resume. The airline said the £40m loss was largely because of suspending these flights, with demand for trips to Egypt also affected since the conflict started. The routes make up about 4% of easyJet’s winter flight schedule. Johan Lundgren, its chief executive, said there were, however, clear signs of recovery in Egypt. “It was definitely impacted hard in the first six or seven weeks, but very quickly bounced back as well.” Lundgren said in November that the conflict would cause a “short-term industry-wide impact on [flight] searches and bookings”, similar to the effect at the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022.  He said on Wednesday: “However horrific these events are from a humanitarian point of view, even if it’s relatively close to the network points, people will take a view – the underlying demand for travel is strong.” The airline reported a pre-tax loss of £126m in the final quarter of 2023, an improvement on the £133m loss during the same period last year. Airlines typically record seasonal winter losses as demand for holidays and flights drops. Group revenues at easyJet rose by 22% to £1.8bn. The group’s holiday booking arm, easyJet Holidays, which was launched in 2019, posted a profit of £30m for the final three months of 2023, up from £13m in the same period last year. The company predicted its first-half results would be up year on year despite the Middle East hit. It said the improved results came from “disciplined capacity growth” where demand was strongest and from productivity benefits. Lundgren said: “We see positive booking momentum for summer 2024 with travel remaining a priority for consumers. “Flight and holidays bookings took off strongly during the traditional busy turn of year sales period, as customers opted to secure their summer holidays to firm favourites like Spain and Portugal alongside destinations further afield like Greece and Turkey.” He said the airline had recorded increased booking volumes, equivalent to filling two planes a minute at peak period, and coming in at higher prices compared with the start of 2022. “Revenue per seat, a combination of load factor and the fares and then ancillaries, is well ahead versus the same period last year,” Lundgren said. Shares in easyJet rose about 4% in morning trading on the back of the upbeat outlook for bookings. The airline also announced an order for more than 300 engines from CFM to power the additional 157 Airbus aircraft it has bought. While easyJet has always used the Franco-American engine supplier, Lundgren said that with many other Airbus customers depending on troubled rival Pratt & Whitney – and other airlines affected by Boeing’s production woes – “we are probably the only airline who is getting the deliveries that we set out to do, with 16 aircraft coming in this year”."

        "content": "The owner of Hinkley Point C has blamed inflation, Covid and Brexit as it announced the nuclear power plant project could be delayed by a further four years, and cost £2.3bn more. The plant in Somerset, which has been under construction since 2016, is now expected to be finished by 2031 and cost up to £35bn, France’s EDF said. However, the cost will be far higher once inflation is taken into account, because EDF is using 2015 prices. The latest in a series of setbacks represents a huge delay to the project’s initial timescale. In 2007, the then EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said that by Christmas in 2017, turkeys would be cooked using electricity generated from atomic power at Hinkley. When the project was finally given the green light in 2016, its cost was estimated at £18bn. “Like other major infrastructure projects, we have found civil construction slower than we hoped and faced inflation, labour and material shortages, on top of Covid and Brexit disruption,” said Stuart Crooks, the project’s managing director, in a message to staff. Crooks said: “Running the project longer will cost more money and our budget has also been affected by rising civil construction costs. It is important to say that British consumers or taxpayers won’t pay a penny, with the increased costs met entirely by shareholders.” EDF had previously said that the first reactor unit at the nuclear site would be due to be complete by June 2027, with a 15-month buffer period which was likely to be used – putting its completion at September 2028, and a further year for the second unit. It costs were estimated between £25bn and £26bn, and this was later revised up to £32.7bn in February 2023. EDF gave three scenarios, ranging from becoming operational is 2029, to delays pushing this back to 2031. It said that the cost of completing Hinkley will be between £31bn and £34bn, although if completion is delayed to 2031 costs would rise to £35bn. In December it emerged EDF’s partner in the project, China General Nuclear, had halted funding for Hinkley. The move came after the government took over CGN’s stake in Hinkley’s proposed sister site, Sizewell C in Suffolk, stripping the Chinese state-owned company of its role in the project. The latest financial estimates are based on accounting in 2015 figures, meaning the total cost of the project could be far higher when inflation over the last decade is factored in. Hinkley’s ballooning costs have proved controversial with French taxpayers, which are picking up the tab. Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C are expected to herald a new era of nuclear plants touted by the government. Last year the government launched a delivery body, Great British Nuclear, with the aim of accelerating the development of new nuclear projects. Earlier this month ministers set out plans for out for the “biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years”. However, the Hinkley Point C delay will add to concerns over project delays and costs, as well as skills in an industry earmarked to deliver a quarter of the national electricity demand by 2050. Crooks wrote: “Dome lift happened 24 months later than we had planned when we began in 2016. Of that delay, 15 months was due to the global pandemic. So, beyond Covid, we’ve lost nine months since we started. That’s not perfect, but for the first nuclear plant to be built in Britain since 1995, it’s not bad.” Crooks said that project was “well past the halfway mark” and “many risks are now behind us”. EDF said in January it would delay the shutdown of four of its UK nuclear reactors for at least two years and increase investment in its British nuclear fleet."

        "content": "ExxonMobil is “committed to responsibly meeting the world’s energy needs”, according to the corporate blah blah, but it is clearly not committed to allowing its shareholders to express their own opinions on the “responsibly” bit of the boast. The US oil company is off to court in Texas to try to block a vote on a resolution tabled by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group that would like Exxon to move faster (a lot faster) on reducing emissions. Exxon has an argument of sorts, one might say, in that Follow This tabled similar-sounding resolutions at the last two annual meetings and neither passed. Some 27.1% of shareholders aligned with the rebels in 2022 and 10.5% last year. Why go through the same process again, the company will argue. And, since last year’s meeting at Exxon contained 13 shareholder motions in total, haven’t US regulators allowed agendas to become overcrowded? Yet the company’s legalistic stance looks absurd in at least three ways. First, Follow This is not an obscure two-bob outfit: its resolution to be heard at Shell’s annual meeting this year is being supported by 27 mainstream investment houses, including Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. Whether Exxon likes it or not, the group represents a meaningful strand of climate opinion in the investment world. The grownup approach would surely be to make a counter-argument and let shareholders decide, just as Shell et al do. Anything else looks like a grubby attempt to avoid scrutiny. Second, the thrust of the Follow This motion merely calls on Exxon to do what most other members of the big oil club have already done and set some targets to reduce scope 3 emissions, meaning those generated by the consumption of its products. If Exxon’s board is determined to stand out by resisting such commitments, it would surely be in its own interests to seek annual validation from its owners. Third – and most obviously – Exxon could probably expect to win again. Yes, the company was humiliated in 2021 when a small hedge fund called Engine No 1 managed to get three of its own candidates voted on to the board, but rebellions (sadly) tend to succeed only when share prices are low, which is not the case at Exxon currently. Why is the company taking such a hard-headed approach? One suspects its real motive may be corporate America’s wider resentment of the growing number of shareholder resolutions being tabled these days. Exxon may see itself as striking a blow for a board’s right to manage without outside interference, especially on climate matters. That is the point at which Follow This’s struggle to be heard should concern all shareholders, whether they agree with the proposal at hand or not. Voting rights matter, and ought to be defended as a basic way to hold cocooned boards to account. The occasional real-world confrontation with the members of the awkward squad is a useful corrective. When the activist in this case could command 27% support – a minority, yes, but not a tiny one – as recently as two years ago, it ought to be seen as outrageous that Exxon thinks it can waft away dissent by running off to court. It would be a useful development if big fund managers rallied to Follow This’s defence. The right to table a climate proposal at an oil company is basic stuff."

        "content": "Royal Mail is braced for the outcome of a five-month review by the communications industry regulator, Ofcom, on Wednesday. The watchdog is poised to lay out options for the future of deliveries, including the universal service obligation (USO) that mandates Royal Mail to deliver nationwide at a fixed price, six days a week. Pre-empting the review, a row has already broken out over an expected option to cut Saturday letter deliveries. As recently as last year, Ofcom rejected the idea, which Royal Mail has pushed for. Industry sources claim a cut to a five-day service is the first step on a road to a three-day a week, or alternate day service, or potentially relaxing delivery targets. Last week, Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of Royal Mail’s parent company, said the USO was “unsustainable” and highlighted shifts in postal services across Europe in a letter to MPs. However, some industry experts say comparing different countries’ services is difficult – with widely different populations, geographies, rates of letter volume decline and approaches to how customers are charged for distances of delivery and weight of packages. Here is how different countries are approaching their post. France A potential government subsidy to run the USO could be included in Ofcom’s review, and Seidenberg cited support in France in his letter. “The French government has granted a subsidy of €2.6bn between 2021-2025 for La Poste,” he wrote. In return, standard letters are delivered within three days against a target of 95% on time. Last year, the timbre rouge, a red stamp guaranteeing next day delivery, was replaced by a fiddly digital equivalent. A turquoise “services plus” now offers tracked delivery within two days, and compensation for late arrival. Denmark The Scandinavian nation has been arguably the most bullish in Europe in paring back its postal service, driven in part by a desire to reduce paper waste. Standard deliveries were first taken down to just one delivery a week in 2016 and, as of this month, the requirement for a single firm to handle a universal service has been ditched. Instead, several operators now offer a set price for letters and parcels nationwide. Exceptions have been made for visually impaired people, those living on small islands and international mail. Italy The Italian government has allowed its service to be reduced significantly, with the introduction of an alternate day delivery with a target of 80% arriving within one, two or three days depending on the region. A four-year, €1.3bn state subsidy for Poste Italiane reaches its final year this year. Meanwhile, Post Italiane’s 15-year remit to deliver to residents throughout Italy ends in 2026. The company, which began serving Italians in 1862, has argued that the “structural decline” in the letters market brought by digital communications continues, although the plunge seen during the pandemic has subsided. A nascent project to implement “smart letter boxes” – with a screen and a detector to sense if there is mail inside – is ongoing. Germany Deutsche Post has the universal service mandate in Germany, meaning it delivers nationwide while its competitors can pick and choose where to deliver, albeit while paying a sales tax. A recent change to legislation, previously last updated in the 1990s, last year recommitted to a six-day-a-week letter service, but reduced the standard letter service from delivery within a day to three days. It also allowed a new next-day premium service to be introduced. Spain The state owned Sociedad Estatal de Correos y Telégrafos, which started life in 1716, handles mail in Spain, and shares responsibilities for delivering to Andorra with France. Rates differ by region – for example, those on the Canary Islands pay more. In January 2020, Correos was awarded €1.28bn (£1.1bn) for delivering the universal service over the previous decade. In 2017, a post office in rural Zamora went viral after it emerged it only opened for 15 minutes a day (11.15am to 11.30am) because of scarce postal traffic in the area. Australia In a nation of 25 million people spread across 7.7m sq km, debate over the future of Australia Post has been raging for some time, amid speculation over further privatisation of the postal service. Last month, the government announced that daily letter deliveries would be phased out across six locations. Parcels will be delivered five days a week, whereas letter deliveries will now be spaced out, occurring every second or third day. Australians are expected to receive less than one letter each week by 2032."

        "content": "Primark is holding the price of its clothing steady this spring, after price rises in 2023, as the retailer said consumer spending remains fragile and some of its costs were falling. The cut-price fashion chain said sales at established stores in the UK rose 3.8% in the 16 weeks to 6 January as prices rose by about 3% and more shoppers bought its slightly pricier The Edit and Rita Ora ranges. Globally Primark’s sales rose 7.3% to £3.4bn in the period, helped by store openings in the US and Europe.   Related: Squishmallows success fails to cushion impact of £200m drop in UK toy sales   The amount of clothing sold fell back as a warm autumn and tight household budgets put off shoppers – although Primark said sales picked up strongly just before Christmas when cold weather hit. “The pricing power of the consumer is still fragile,” said Eoin Tonge, the finance director of Primark’s parent group, Associated British Foods (ABF). “[The world] is not in a strong consumer place at the moment. [Outside the UK] it is even tougher.” Primark’s pace of growth slowed in the autumn but the store-only seller’s growth was another sign of the high street’s win over online clothing specialists at Christmas. While major retailers that can offer online orders and a vast network of stores – such as Marks & Spencer and Next – did well over the festive period, those more reliant on web traffic or with weaker brands struggled. On Tuesday, the fast fashion website Boohoo said it had traded in line with expectations over Christmas – which were for a sales fall of up to 17% despite inflation – as it battles heavy competition from rapidly growing Chinese sellers such as Shein as well as a return to high street shopping, particularly among young people. Quiz, which makes almost a third of its sales online, also revealed that sales in December were down 11% on the same month a year before, which it said reflected the “negative impact of inflationary pressures on consumer demand which resulted in declines in traffic both in-store and online”. Tonge said Primark had gained its highest value UK market share to date as hard pressed shoppers turned to the cut-price chain. It was helped by a new online stock-checking service, click and collect on some products in 50-plus UK stores and sought-after lines such as the Rita Ora collection. “Our average selling price has been going up for about 12 months. We are out of that now and we don’t expect any more price increases. It is a question of whether we will start to see prices decreasing,” Tonge added. The cost of materials, such as cotton, and of manufacturing goods is coming down but staff costs are increasing. Tonge said wage rises would have greater impact than the additional cost of shipping driven by container ships having to travel around Africa because of attacks on vessels off the coast of Yemen, which are discouraging many from transiting the Red Sea. “This is not like Covid when all ports were having problems. This is one shipping [route] and most have just changed line. It is relatively adaptable,” Tonge said. He said the alternative route added two weeks to transit and would be more expensive. He thought this was “another reason that prices won’t come down soon” but added “we don’t think it is material and we will just have to absorb it”. ABF promised City analysts that Primark could stick to its plan to rebuild profit margins after last year’s drop, despite the freight issue, as analysts at Barclays said: “We doubt the impact would exceed £20m unless the situation in the Red Sea were to significantly worsen.” Tonge said there was still inflation on food but he expected prices to begin to fall by the end of 2024. “Commodities and energy have come down significantly and that was a big driver of inflation,” he added. While labour costs were still rising, he said: “The trend on food inflation will continue to come down and I think we will go into deflation.”"

Hughes explains that the level of spending headroom in the budget - which has improved based on the likelihood of lower inflation and lower interest rates this year - is still a fraction of the risks inherent in five-year forecasts of government debt. He said the £13bn available to the chancellor based on the November autumn statement forecast amounts to “a quarter to one eighth of the 2% to 4% of gross domestic product” at risk when there is a shock to the economy that forces an expensive rescue package to be deployed.

He said his forecasts were based on “questionable assumptions” that lead people to call his efforts a work of fiction. Hughes says:  “Some people call [the projections] a work of fiction, but that is probably being generous when someone has bothered to write a work of fiction and the government hasn’t even bothered to write down what its departmental spending plans are, underpinning the plans for public services”.   Updated at 3.57pm GMT    3.16pm GMT   Steelworkers from South Wales who travelled 170 miles from Port Talbot to Westminster have been urging politicians to “stand up and support them” after plans to cut thousands of jobs were unveiled last week. Electrical engineer Jason Wyatt, 41, said workers were being “held in contempt” by Tata, and warned that Port Talbot will fall “further into destitution” should the industry fail. Mr Wyatt who has been working in the industry for 25 years and lives in nearby Neath continued:   “Our message to politicians is step up, stand up and put your support behind us, behind the steel industry. “Steel is critical to the UK first and foremost, but to Port Talbot, it is the biggest employer in the area, and in contributing to the economy it’s massive in South Wales. “It’s imperative that we maintain operations on one blast furnace during the transition, at least until the electric arc furnace is brought online.”      3.05pm GMT   Over in France, Amazon has been fined €32m what the country’s data watchdog called “excessive” surveillance of its warehouse workers. The CNIL has imposed the fine on Amazon France Logistique, which manages the e-commerce giant’s warehouses, over the data recorded by handheld scanners used by staff. The watchdog said the implementation of the system measured interruptions in activity so precisely that it led workers to have to justify each break or interruption, and was in fact illegal. The CNIL called the system “excessive” and also raised concerns over Amazon keeping the data collected on workers for 31 days.     2.22pm GMT   In the property sector, Nationwide Building Society has joined the ranks of lenders cutting rates.

The UK government is contributing £500m to a £1.25bn programme to switch to more environmentally-friendly methods at the south Wales plant. But Gething, a Labour MS (member of the Senedd), said that the Welsh Government could not afford to invest the sums of money needed to prevent the job losses announced last Friday, most of which will fall at Port Talbot. He said:  “It would require hundreds of millions of pounds of additional investment. I am really clear about this” “It’s not a marginal investment of one or two million - it’s hundreds of millions. “I think this comes down to whether the UK Government is prepared to contribute to a future of the UK steel sector.”  Debate over the future of the steelworks reached Westminster today. As part of an “opposition day”, Labour plans to force a vote on the job cuts. Shadow business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds said.  “This is a bad deal, leaving thousands of workers out of a job, handing over millions of taxpayer’s money and risking the UK’s national security.”  As covered earlier, steelworkers gathered outside Parliament in blustery conditions to protest Tata’s decision and accused Rishi Sunak’s government of “stringing us along”. “We need real investment with job guarantees.” they said.

Hasn writes:  GBTC [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF] recorded outflows worth $640m yesterday alone. The reason for this huge amount is that the bankrupt crypto exchange, FTX, continues to liquidate its assets. This ETF, in turn, is also still suffering from the exodus of investors from it, either taking profits after previously buying at a large discount from the net asset value before converting it to an ETF, or moving to other alternatives that are substantially less expensive. This massive outflow of ETFs came after a week that saw net inflows of about $1.25 billion into all US spot Bitcoin ETFs, in addition to about $11.8 billion in trading volume, according to data provided by CoinShares. But in the end, all crypto investment products globally recorded outflows of about $21 million last week.

Related: The SEC has approved bitcoin ETFs. What are they and what does it mean for investors?   Some analysts predicted those ETFs would lead to a flood of money into bitcoin, as they made it easier to invest in it. Simon Peters, crypto analyst at eToro, says some ETF funds are proving popular:  As most in the crypto community predicted, IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust from Blackrock) and Fidelity’s FBTC are picking up a lot of the market share, currently accounting for 19% and 20% of the total ETF market share respectively. GBTC from Grayscale still holds the most bitcoin of any of the spot ETFs with 53% of the market share, however this was all acquired from its days as an investment trust, before it made the conversion to an ETF. GBTC since becoming an ETF has actually seen net outlaws totalling 66,500 BTC (around $2.6billion at current market prices) in all likelihood due to the high fees prompting investors to switch to lower fee alternatives.  Overall, the approval of the bitcoin spot ETFs has proved to be a ‘sell the news’ event, Peters adds. The WSJ reports that Grayscale, the crypto asset manager that forced U.S. regulators’ hand in approving bitcoin exchange-traded funds, “has lost billions from their launch” as investors cashed out. And last month, my colleague Nils Pratley did explain that hopes that bitcoin would now surge to the moon might be misplaced, if the necessary demand wasn’t there….

Instead, the chancellor could devote any extra headroom in the March budget to lowering borrowing, or to increased investment. Indeed, it would make more sense to work out how much investment the country needs, and then balance the burden between borrowing and tax (rather than prioritising cutting tax, and restricting investment to what you can safely borrow). But politics doesn’t seem to work like that. And if Hunt does blow a likely £20bn fiscal headroom on lowering taxes in March, it could make it harder for the Labour party to push its plan to spend £28bn on green capital investment, should it win the next election. The Financial Times reports:  Senior Labour figures have admitted they will look again at the £28bn-a-year spending promise if Hunt spends any fiscal flex that might be available to an incoming Labour government to cut income tax or national insurance. Hunt’s allies also expect Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to use the March 6 Budget as an “excuse” to drop the target, which has been repeatedly watered down in recent months. “We have got our fiscal rules, they come first,” said a Labour official. “This is a Budget we are not writing.”   New - Labour will look again at its £28bn green plan if ⁦@Jeremy_Hunt⁩ burns through the fiscal headroom for Budget tax cuts.

Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that higher VAT and income tax receipts coupled with lower spending resulted in a deficit of £7.8bn in December 2023 – the lowest for the month since the pre-pandemic year of 2019. With lower debt interest payments also contributing to the improvement in the government’s financial position, analysts said the prospects for a giveaway package had brightened. The December deficit was more than £6bn lower than the £14bn pencilled in by the Office for Budget Responsibility – the independent watchdog responsible for the government’s fiscal and economic forecasts.

Associated British Foods told shareholders this morning that it does not expect any significant disruption to our supply chain due to events in the Red Sea, adding:  We also feel more confident in the delivery of the Primark adjusted operating margin in this financial year, driven by a further improvement in product gross margin. This should insulate us well against potential additional costs of supply due to the disruption in the Red Sea should they arise.   ABF also reported that sales slowed at Primark last Christmas. Like-for-like sales grew by 2.1% in the 16 weeks to 6 January 2024, driven by higher average selling prices, slower than the 8% growth recorded in the previous quarter. Total Primark sales grew 7.9%, after a slow start blamed on unseasonally warm weather. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says:  “Primark remains the engine of growth for the business, with its value offerings still hitting the spot with an increasingly cost-conscious consumer. Despite a slow start to the quarter given some unseasonably warm weather, Primark was back with a bang for Christmas. Womenswear and menswear were particularly strong, with the Christmas ranges proving popular.      7.58am GMT   New data from HM Revenue and Customs this morning shows how the tax burden has risen this year. Total HMRC receipts for April 2023 to December 2023 have risen to £580.8bn, which is £26bn higher than a year ago. Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) rose by £12.8bn, while VAT brought in £8bn more and business taxes raked in an extra £9.2bn. Inheritance Tax receipts for April 2023 to December 2023 were £5.7bn, £0.4bn higher than the same period last year. Nicholas Hyett, Investment Manager at Wealth Club says:   “The government’s income from death duties is going up. That makes changes to IHT policy a careful balancing act.  Cutting rates might win votes, since many see IHT as an unjust grab for money that’s already been taxed once. But the revenue earned is playing an important part in the government’s spending programme, and a shortfall would need to be made up somewhere else.  Contrary to popular belief, inheritance tax doesn’t just affect the super-rich. Frozen tax brackets mean many who would not consider themselves wealthy will find themselves falling into the IHT bracket in future. Their standard of living hasn’t changed, indeed inflation means it might have gone backwards, but the government now considers them to be wealthy enough to face inheritance tax.  But receipts from stamp taxes fell by £4bn, while tobacco reeipts were £1.3bn lower.     7.47am GMT   Elsewhere in the economy, Lidl is increasing minimum pay for its shop staff from £11.40 to £12.00 an hour from 1 March, in the cut-price grocer’s third pay rise in a year.  The increase brings Lidl in line with rival Aldi which will increase minimum pay to £12 an hour next month. Both will be in line with the independently verified living wage as competition for workers continues to be high in a tight labour market.     7.41am GMT   The drop in government support for energy bills also pushed down borrowing in December, says Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK. Stelmach explains:  “Public sector net borrowing came in at £7.8 billion in December 2023, down significantly from £16.2 billion a year earlier. This was mainly due to a large drop in debt interest payments which reflected a fall in monthly RPI inflation in October, while the energy price schemes, which contributed to spending last winter, are no longer in place. Indeed, government spending on subsidies and other current grants, which included the cost of the Energy Price Guarantee and other support schemes, was down by £5.9 billion on a year ago.  Stelmach cautions, though that the UK’s fiscal outlook is “riddled with uncertainty”. That means that some of Jeremy Hunt’s wiggle room could “easily be squashed” if some of the downside risks materialise.  Stelmach explains:  The government’s implicit commitment to freeze fuel duty rates lowers revenue by £6 billion a year relative to current plans, while the assumption that real spending on unprotected departments would have to fall by over 2% a year is largely unrealistic in the absence of significant productivity improvements. That’s before considering the longer-term pressures from an ageing population, energy transition, and slowing workforce growth.”      7.38am GMT  Capital Economics: more wiggle room for a big pre-election splash  Jeremy Hunt has “more wiggle room for a big pre-election splash”, following this morning’s drop in government borrowing, say City consultancy Capital Economics. Ruth Gregory, their Deputy Chief UK Economist, estimates that Hunt could have £20bn of headroom for tax cuts in March. She says:  After nine months of the 2023/24 fiscal year, borrowing is on track to undershoot the OBR’s full-year borrowing forecast of £123.9bn by £5.0bn.  What’s more, with market interest rate expectations and long-dated gilt yields having fallen since November, we suspect the OBR will revise down its borrowing forecast significantly from 2025/26. That may provide the Chancellor with “headroom” against his fiscal mandate of about £20bn in the Budget. That will probably allow him to unveil a freeze in fuel duty in April 2024 (costing about £6.0bn a year) but perhaps also to announce more crowd-pleasing measures, such as a 1p cut to income tax (costing £6.9bn a year), while still maintaining fiscally prudent appearances.      7.31am GMT   Divya Sridhar, economist at PwC, is hopeful that the bill for the UK’s inflation-linked bonds will continue to fall – easing the pressure on the public finances:  “The relatively lower debt interest payments in December 2023 were a key driver of the lower monthly borrowing figure compared to recent months.  Last month recorded the lowest December interest payment figure since 2020, and was less than a fourth of the interest payments paid in December 2022. Despite the small uptick in CPI inflation last month from 3.9% to 4.0%, we expect inflation pressures to continue easing over the coming months, further lowering government spending on interest payments.”      7.24am GMT  Trott: economy is beginning to turn a corner  Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, has commented on this morning’s UK borrowing figures, saying:    “Protecting millions of lives and livelihoods during Putin’s energy shock and a once in a century pandemic has created economic challenges. However, it is right that we pay back these debts so future generations are not left to pick up the tab. “Because of this Government’s decisive action, the economy is now beginning to turn a corner: Inflation has more than halved. Debt is on track to fall as a share of the economy. And we have been able to afford tax cuts for 27 million working people, and an £11 billion tax cut to drive business investment. “      7.23am GMT   The broader picture is that the UK national dent was clocked at £2.685 trillion at the end of December 2023, which is around 97.7% of UK GDP. That’s 1.9 percentage points higher than in December 2022 and the highest level since the early 1960s.  Public sector net debt was £2,685.6 billion at the end of December 2023, and was provisionally estimated at   around 97.7% of the UK’s annual gross domestic product.➡️ https://t.co/KEl5HlNE51 pic.twitter.com/BI75ubxuoE— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 23, 2024      7.20am GMT  Introduction: UK borrowing falls  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s monthly government borrowing fell last month, potentially giving chancellor Jeremy Hunt more room for tax cuts in the March budget. Figures just released by the Office for National Statistics show that the UK’s public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) fell to £7.8bn in December. That’s the lowest deficit for any December since 2019, just before the Covid-19 pandemic, and half as much as the UK borrowed to balance the books in December 2022. It’s also a lot lower than forecast; economists polled by Reuters had expected public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, to hit £14bn.  Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was £7.8 billion in December 2023.This was £8.4 billion less than in December 2022, and the lowest December figure since 2019.➡️ https://t.co/KEl5HlNE51 pic.twitter.com/z00WhjRpRC— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 23, 2024  Falling inflation helped to push down borrowing, by lowering the interest bill on index-linked government debt. Central government debt interest payable was £4bn in December, £14.1bn less than in December 2022, the ONS says, due to the fall in the Retail Price Index measure of inflation. So far this financial year (since April), the UK has borrowed £119.1bn, which is £5bn lower borrowing than the £124.1bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. That indicates there is wiggle-room for some fiscal loosening, while keeping within the government’s fiscal rules. This is the fourth-highest borrowing bill at this stage of the financial year since monthly records began in 1993, behind the Covid-19 years of 2020, 2021, and 2009 following the global financial crisis. Last week in Davos, Hunt dangled the prospect of big tax cuts in his March budget, telling reporters that he wanted to move in the direction of a low-tax economy. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, the chancellor said:  “In terms of the direction of travel we look around the world and we note that the economies growing faster than us in North America and Asia tend to have lower taxes, and I believe fundamentally that low-tax economies are more dynamic, more competitive and generate more money for public services like the NHS. That’s the direction of travel we would like to go in but it is too early to say what we are going to do.”    Related: Jeremy Hunt hints at voter-friendly tax giveaway in March budget    Also coming up today Workers from Tata’s steelworks in Port Talbot are heading to Parliament today, ahead of a House of Commons debate on the future of the plant.

        "content": "A leading online travel agent has added filters to let users exclude flights that use Boeing’s troubled 737 Max planes, after a piece of fuselage falling off an Alaska Airlines flight led to a surge of user interest in avoiding the airliners. Kayak first introduced an aircraft filter in March 2019, to add and exclude specific models of plane, but the company says it saw little use compared with the more prominent filters of the number of stops or airports. Following the Alaska Airlines incident, it says there was a 15-fold increase in use of the original filter, prompting it to rework the setting, making it more prominent on the search page and adding the ability to distinguish between 737 Max 8 and Max 9 planes, since only the latter has been grounded by America’s Federal Aviation Administration. “Whether you’re searching by cabin class, flight quality or aircraft type, Kayak’s filters aim to provide travellers with all the information they need to make smart decisions and travel with confidence,” a company spokesperson said. The surge of interest in the new feature demonstrates the unusual extent to which typical travellers are actively avoiding the 737 Max planes. Such filters are more commonly used by regular travellers with esoteric preferences around particular seat locations on various planes, rather than a broad-brush fear of an entire family of jets. On Sunday, the FAA expanded its scrutiny of Boeing jets to another, older model of 737, the 737-900ER, which it says uses a similar door design. “The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning these aircraft to service,” it said. In response, United Airlines, which has 79 737 Max 9s and a further 136 737-900ERs in its fleet, issued a profit warning. The airline has more of the affected planes than any other, and it forecasts that it will not be able to fly them again until at least February. In its annual earning report on Tuesday, United reported flat pre-tax profits of $3.4bn for 2023, but said it expected to lose money in the coming quarter."

        "content": "Households across Reading, the UK’s biggest town, have been without water for three days after water mains burst in the cold weather. An incident at the Pangbourne water treatment works meant that water pressure dropped across the town on Saturday. Thames Water, which has its headquarters in Reading, said that subsequent pipe bursts then made it impossible to increase water pressure to homes, meaning some people have been without water for days. Emergency bottled water stations have been set up in the affected areas. On Monday, some schools and offices were forced to close as the low water pressure meant it was unsafe to stay open. Hundreds of homes in south London also reported having no water over the weekend after leaks across the network caused shortages. This is despite heavy rain falling over recent days. Water companies are preparing to announce steep bill price rises for customers. Thames Water, according to reports, wants to raise bills by 20% in the coming years to pay for infrastructure improvements after public outcry over sewage spills and leaky pipes. Water companies have failed to replace leaky pipes, which are many decades old. Analysis has shown that it would take English water companies 2,000 years to replace their pipes to get them up to standard at current rates. Analysis of Water UK data from 2021 by the Angling Trust found that on average, water companies replace 0.05% of their water and wastewater pipe networks a year. Most European countries replace their water and wastewater pipes at about 0.5% a year. Alok Sharma, the MP for Reading West, apologised to his constituents and said he was in talks with senior managers of Thames Water. He said: “So sorry that constituents continue to experience problems with water supply. Have just spoken to a senior manager at Thames Water who says they are working hard to restore pressure.” Jason Brock, the leader of Reading borough council and Reading Labour, said the communication with residents had been poor. He told Reading Today: “Their support to, and communication with, residents has been unacceptably poor. Residents understandably feel that Thames Water simply don’t care about them.” Lib Dem environment spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: “This is a complete farce. Thames Water’s new CEO should write to every person affected with compensation and a grovelling apology. It begs the question just how bad a state is the infrastructure they get paid to maintain? It’s time they stopped spending millions of pounds on bonuses and dividends, and instead focused on the basics.” A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry to customers in the Reading, Pangbourne, Tilehurst and nearby areas who continue to experience low water pressure. “We have over nine tankers supplying water in the area to meet demand and improve water pressure. We also have over 50 engineers in the area fixing leaks and removing airlocks from our network. Teams are also repairing over 10 burst water mains, following the cold weather last week. “We expect water pressure to improve in the coming days as we carry out repairs and as reservoir levels increase, following a technical issue at Pangbourne water treatment works, which was resolved on Saturday.” "

        "content": "The boss of the struggling housebuilder Crest Nicholson is stepping down after it revealed its profits have plummeted by 70% in a year amid runaway costs and a slump in the number of property completions. Peter Truscott will be replaced as chief executive by Martyn Clark, now chief commercial officer at rival Persimmon, later this year. After three profit warnings in the past six months – the most recent a week ago – Crest reported a 70% decline in adjusted profits before tax to £41.4m in the 12 months to 31 October.   Related: Tweaks, delays and compromises define UK’s post-Carillion response | Nils Pratley   It completed 2,020 new homes, down about a quarter from 2,734 the year before, leading to a 28% drop in revenue to £657.5m. It blamed the weakness in the housing market. Truscott said the company was aiming to build 1,800 to 2,000 homes this year. Profits were adversely affected by additional costs of £5.5m at the Brightwells Yard site in Farnham and other sites. The Farnham project has been delayed because of a series of planning, legal and construction problems. The company took a further charge of £11.3m for internal and external works on older buildings to rectify fire safety defects after the devastating Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 caused by combustive cladding. Crest’s total provision has risen to £144.8m from £140.8m. Builders have been forced to join the government’s developer remediation contract committing them to rectify unsafe buildings. Separately, Crest booked a charge of £13m for a legal claim it has recently received, relating to a low-rise apartment block built by the group near Reading in 2019 that was damaged by fire in 2021. Truscott described the results as “disappointing”, but added: “Recently there has been some positive macro trends with inflation and mortgage rates falling, which bode well for the housing sector. “Although it is too early to gauge customer behaviour, we have been encouraged by an increase in customer interest levels and inquiries this calendar year. However, we remain mindful of ongoing uncertainties within the broader economy.” He said hurdles in the planning system would leader to slower housebuilding volumes across the sector. Andy Murphy, an analyst at Edison Group, said: “The announcement of CEO Peter Truscott’s retirement and the appointment of Martyn Clark signals a crucial leadership transition. “Clark brings extensive industry experience, and his role becomes crucial in steering the company’s strategic recovery, controlling costs, and sustaining growth. Investors will closely watch how the leadership change contributes to Crest Nicholson’s efforts to overcome the recent operational and financial challenges.” Other housebuilders have also reported sharp declines in home completions. Persimmon built 9,922 homes last year, down by a third from the 14,868 in 2022. However, its fourth quarter was stronger as mortgage lenders cut their rates amid a fierce price war. Looking ahead, the housebuilder said market conditions remained highly uncertain, particularly for first-time buyers. Taylor Wimpey also built fewer homes last year – 10,848 compared with 14,154 in 2022 – but raised its average selling price by 5.1% to £370,000."

        "content": "Charles Randell had no idea what was about to unfold as he made his way to Downing Street in September 2007. Days earlier, the then chancellor Alistair Darling had taken drastic measures, guaranteeing deposits at Northern Rock in an effort to halt Britain’s first bank run in 140 years. The future Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) chair – a partner at “magic circle” law firm Slaughter and May at the time – had followed the news closely, but admits: “I had no idea that this was the beginning of a huge snowball that would lead to a much bigger set of problems – and a very long-running assignment.” After a briefing with Treasury officials, who were familiar with Randell’s work on projects privatising the likes of British Gas, he was led down to No 11 Downing Street to meet his next client: Darling himself. “The whole thing is quite a blur,” Randell recalls. What ensued was a five-year appointment as the government’s chief legal adviser, as ministers spent £1tn to bail out and stabilise a banking system whose bosses were slow to recognise the severity of the crisis. Randell recalls being “stunned” weeks later, as he watched Northern Rock’s board discuss paying dividends just weeks after Darling’s intervention, eventually spurring him to push for government contingency plans for the bank’s eventual nationalisation. A year later, he was in the room as disgraced Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was sacked by ministers, who had launched a bailout to save the lender from collapse that eventually totalled £46bn. “He was very surprised, and I think the [RBS] board was quite surprised,” Randell recalls. “I think this was another example of the fact that many people took a while to adjust the understanding of how bad things actually were.” It was a relentless role that sent Randell’s career in a very different direction tto what he had imagined. Born in 1958, he spent his formative years in postwar Germany, where his father worked as an intelligence officer for MI5. His family’s financial circumstances had been masked by subsidised military living, but the illusion was shattered when he was 12 years old and they returned to the UK during the economic doldrums of the 1970s. With no savings and only enough money to rent a small flat in Merton, south London, “it was quite a bleak comparison”, says Randell. While he eventually secured a place at Oxford University, financial worries pushed him to switch from English to law. His father’s sudden death from lung cancer left his mother with a meagre civil service widow’s pension, and a young Randell prioritising a supportive salary over his own educational passions. But a graduate position in 1980 would lead to “varied and interesting work” as Slaughter and May became the go-to law firm for privatisation projects that took companies such as British Telecom, British Aerospace and British Gas out of public hands. His reputation resulted in his financial-crisis-era role with the UK government, which was swiftly followed by a similar position advising the Portuguese government on its own crisis in 2012. Randell eventually returned to the UK and in 2013 was convinced to join long-term efforts to reinforce the now tarnished financial system. He became a founding board member of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – one of two City regulators that replaced the disgraced Financial Services Authority in the wake of the crisis. There, he helped implement the first stress tests, meant to measure the financial strength of the banking sector, helping earn him a CBE for services to financial stability and climate change policy in 2016. By 2018, he was persuaded to chair the second arm of the City’s regulatory system, the FCA, alongside Andrew Bailey, now Bank of England governor. But the numerous issues plaguing the FCA – which was in desperate need of modernisation and was accused of failing to protect investors who had lost hundreds of millions of pounds though the Neil Woodford and London Capital & Finance scandals – led to a demanding four years. While the FCA and PRA started with comparable workloads, the balance started to tip in 2014, when the former of the two bodies was put in charge of more than 30,000 consumer creditors, including derided payday lenders. “The workload of the FCA was doubled but the staff wasn’t and the budget wasn’t,” Randell says. Next came fears over failed providers of funeral plans and concerns over the cryptocurrency boom. “I probably look at the FCA as the most challenging job I’ve ever had. Many things were not fun … [but] there were other things that were hugely valuable to me,” Randell says, particularly connecting with real people affected by a financial sector often criticised for operating in its own City bubble. He recalls meeting a man struggling to pay off a loan shark linked to a paramilitary group in Belfast, pensioners in Solihull struggling to access increasingly digital banking services and workers in Blackpool struggling to manage finances on meagre benefits. They left such lasting impressions that Randell, who left the FCA after four years in 2022, was spurred on to join the Financial Inclusion Commission in November: a group of experts that sponsors research and lobbies for accessible financial services for vulnerable consumers. Its work is now set to influence Labour’s financial sector agenda, with Randell among 10 independent City grandees advising the party as it crafts fresh policies before the next general election. While Randell emphasises his lack of political leanings, his wealth of experience leaves him warning Labour to be prepared: “The key thing is to have a plan. Because once you get into power, events take over.” CV Age: 65Family members: Wife Celia, three adult sons.Education: Bradfield College in Berkshire, an undergraduate degree in law at Trinity.

        "content": "Consultancy firm EY Oceania was supporting the oil and gas industry’s lobbying efforts while being paid by the federal government for independent advice on its signature climate policy and gas emissions. The firm, which is a member of the oil and gas lobby and audits Santos, insists there was no conflict of interest between its work for industry and government. But a bipartisan group of politicians and transparency advocates is not convinced and has demanded more information.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  In late October, EY Oceania was hired by Australian Energy Producers (AEP) to publish a report on the future of the gas industry. The 27 November report called for “ongoing investment in gas supply” and warned against a rapid transition away from gas. EY Oceania was also hired to support AEP – formerly known as the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association – and prepare a submission outlining concerns about the government’s future gas strategy, which was being developed by the industry department. The submission, also submitted on 27 November, frequently cited EY’s analysis and conclusions.   Related: EY fired Australian partner accused of promoting tax minimisation scheme, letter published by Senate inquiry reveals   While EY was working for AEP, it was also contracted by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to provide “analysis and advice on emission outputs for oil and gas facilities”, “analysis and advice under the safeguard mechanism” and “professional advice on market modelling services electricity”. These contracts were worth $510,000, according to government records. The Albanese government’s safeguard mechanism aims to limit emissions from the country’s biggest industrial sites. This would impact many AEP members including Santos. EY did not tell the government it was a member of the AEP. “There is no overlap of subject matter nor is there a risk of one EY team reviewing the work of another EY team,” the spokesperson said. “When a conflict of interest exists, or arises during an engagement, we will disclose this to the client, which may result in EY declining to act, as required by professional standards.” Despite claiming there was no conflict of interest, EY was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement while working on the safeguard mechanism and to submit written assurances about how internal conflicts would be managed with regard to staff and other engagements. Greens MP Abigail Boyd, who is leading a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the consulting industry, was not convinced by EY’s assurances and said she would seek more detail when EY appears before the inquiry next month. “Once again we have a consulting firm deploying a farcically narrow and self-serving definition of conflict of interest that simply doesn’t pass the pub test,” Boyd said. “I’m putting EY on notice that I fully intend to interrogate this issue. The implications for government and public policy in this space are too grave for this issue to go un-interrogated.” Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who is a member of a federal inquiry into the industry, said she was concerned by firms advising government on policies that would affect the profitability of their private sector clients. The chief executive of Transparency International, Clancy Moore, said there was “clearly a potential conflict of interest in this case”.   Related: China instructs state firms to phase out big four auditors   “It’s not a good look to have the government paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a consultancy firm for independent advice on the oil and gas industry while the same firm is also on the payroll of the oil and gas industry,” Moore said. “We would expect EY to have disclosed the conflict of interest and explained how they managed the conflict of interest to relevant stakeholders including the government.” Doctors for the Environment Australia, a group of medical professionals who lobby the government on climate change, said EY should not have been hired by the department. “It is deeply troubling that our government engages a consultancy firm to advise on mechanisms touted to reduce our reliance on gas when that same firm is also employed by the gas industry to provide advice on its ongoing expansion,” said the group’s executive director, Dr Kate Wylie. A DCCEEW spokesperson said it hired EY “to provide specialist services and capability that that were not available in the department”. Independent ACT senator David Pocock said there was “clear scope here for a serious conflict of interest” given EY’s taxpayer-funded contracts and “the work they were being paid for by the oil and gas lobby”."

        "published_date": "2024-01-23T13:56:04+00:00",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt’s scope to cut taxes by about £20bn in his March budget has been boosted after the latest official figures showed UK government borrowing halving in the past year.  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that higher VAT and income-tax receipts coupled with lower spending resulted in a deficit of £7.8bn in December 2023 – the lowest for the month since the pre-pandemic year of 2019. With lower debt-interest payments also contributing to the improvement in the government’s financial position, analysts said the prospects for a giveaway package had brightened.   Related: Average UK person has lost out on £10,200 since 2010, thinktank says   The December deficit was more than £6bn lower than the £14bn pencilled in by the Office for Budget Responsibility – the independent watchdog responsible for the government’s fiscal and economic forecasts. Despite the smaller than expected December deficit, in the first nine months of the financial year the government borrowed just over £119bn – £11bn more than in the same period of 2022-23 and the fourth highest on record. Borrowing in the first eight months of 2023-4 has been revised down by £4.2bn. Hunt could use any windfall to cut taxes, increase public spending or pay down debt – or a combination of all three – but the chancellor dropped a broad hint when he attended last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos that he was planning a package of tax cuts in his 6 March budget. With opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives are on course for a landslide defeat, the budget is seen as one of the government’s last hopes of changing the political climate. Another indication of Hunt’s room for manoeuvre will be provided by the January borrowing figures, traditionally a bumper month for income-tax receipts before the self-assessment deadline. For January 2023 the ONS reported a surplus – where tax receipts are higher than spending – of £7.4bn. Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the analysts Capital Economics, said that after nine months of the 2023-24 fiscal year, borrowing was on track to undershoot the OBR’s full-year borrowing forecast of £123.9bn by £5bn. “What’s more, with market interest rate expectations and long-dated gilt yields having fallen since November, we suspect the OBR will revise down its borrowing forecast significantly from 2025-26,” she added. Hunt’s scope to cut taxes is constrained by his rule that debt should be falling as a share of national income in five years’ time, but Gregory said the latest data showed the chancellor would meet this target with about £20bn to spare. The ONS said debt was 97.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in December – an increase of almost two percentage points compared with a year earlier. Gregory said: “That will probably allow him to unveil a freeze in fuel duty in April 2024 (costing about £6bn a year) but perhaps also to announce more crowd-pleasing measures, such as a 1p cut to income tax (costing £6.9bn a year), while still maintaining fiscally prudent appearances.” Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “Protecting millions of lives and livelihoods during Putin’s energy shock and a once in a century pandemic has created economic challenges. However, it is right that we pay back these debts so future generations are not left to pick up the tab. “Because of this government’s decisive action, the economy is now beginning to turn a corner. Inflation has more than halved. Debt is on track to fall as a share of the economy. And we have been able to afford tax cuts for 27 million working people, and an £11bn tax cut to drive business investment.” Cara Pacitti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Lower-than-expected inflation late last year has reduced debt interest costs and given the chancellor a timely fiscal boost ahead of his budget in March. “However, lower inflation is also likely to mean lower tax receipts. How these factors offset each other will be important in deciding how much fiscal headroom the chancellor has.”"

        "content": "Last year was no fun for the UK toy industry with annual sales dropping by nearly £200m as cash-strapped parents bought fewer and cheaper games and action figures for their children – with the bestseller being a £9 cuddly toy. Sales dropped by 5% to £3.5bn in 2023, according to the annual toy industry report by the market research company Circana. With households mired in a cost of living crisis, the runaway success story was Squishmallows. The whimsical soft toys shifted by the truckload in a market in which 12.5m fewer toys were sold than in 2022.   Related: Mr Kipling maker to cut more prices after bumper festive sales   Nearly two-thirds of toysbought in the UK market were under £10 as shoppers opted for cheaper purchases. “People are saying no to those impulse purchases and even saying no to pester power,” said Melissa Symonds, the executive director of UK toys at Circana. “They are still buying toys for birthdays and Christmas.” While other products were left on the shelf, sales of collectible stuffed animals are thriving. Children and adults are filling their bedrooms with cuddly stuffed creatures, with Ty Beanie Babies, Pokemon and of course Squishmallows among the brands selling well. Launched in 2017, there are now thousands of Squishmallows designs, each with a unique name and biography, a facet that stokes their appeal for collectors who seek out their favourite characters. Bumper sales of the smaller-sized versions, which cost about £9, helped the soft toy category defy the gloom to post growth of 11%. While less money was spent on toys for children, adults spent more on stuff for themselves, with “kidults” (buyers aged 12 and over) behind almost 30% of total UK toy sales in 2023. The kidult market was up 6%, spending £1bn on popular items such as Lego sets, soft toy collections and action figures. “Adults are seeking out escapism activities that tap into their childhood, evoking a more carefree time in their lives,” added Symonds. “This inclination towards toys that fulfil this need not only indulges their nostalgia but also positively contributes to their mental wellbeing.” Despite businesses coming under pressure from inflation, the average selling price of a toy increased by just 25p to £10.79. After several difficult years, Circana said the toy market is expected to stabilise in 2024 as consumer confidence is improving. “With people facing difficult times financially, these figures are not surprising,” said Kerri Atherton, the head of public affairs at the British Toy and Hobby Association, speaking as its annual toy fair got under way in London on Tuesday. The robust demand for plush toys, games and building sets pointed to the resilience of the UK toy market, she added."

However, Premier Foods is continuing to increase the cost of the own-brand products it makes for retailers and the food ingredients it supplies them, adding to inflation in shoppers’ baskets. One of the UK’s biggest food manufacturers, Premier hailed its biggest ever Christmas, with grocery sales up 11.9% year on year in the 13 weeks to 30 December. Overall group sales rose 14.4%, as the company grabbed a bigger share of the market. International sales increased 11%.

However, Premier flagged price increases in retailer branded products compared with the same period last year. Alex Whitehouse, the chief executive, said: “The lower promotional price points we introduced in the third quarter have positively impacted performance while also helping consumer budgets go further. These lower prices will be extended to additional products … in quarter four.” The company said a lot of its volume was sold on promotion throughout the year. Food prices have been rising steeply in the past couple of years, as manufacturers pass on higher energy and labour costs to customers. Food inflation has eased in recent months, bringing some relief to consumers. Premier sold 4m more mince pies in the Christmas period than the year before, while new product ranges such as Bisto meat-free gravy, Oxo stock pots and Paxo chicken and bacon stuffing also did well. The company said it was “well on track” to meet its previously raised profit expectations. In November, Premier upgraded its annual profit forecast for the second time in 2023. The company, which reported a 21% increase in adjusted profits before tax of £56.9m in its first half, said it expected full-year trading profits to be 10% ahead of last year’s £157.5m."

        "content": "English sparkling wine maker Chapel Down toasted a 14% rise in sales last year to £15m as the company said homegrown fizz makers had grabbed share from champagne.  The Kent-based vineyard, which listed on the Aim junior stock market last month, said it had increased sales of its core sparkling wine by 25% last year helped by a 12% increase in prices. Sales of all Chapel Down products in pubs and restaurants rose 26% as the brand extended to new outlets, while exports were up 67% as the brand had a successful first year in UK duty free outlets including Heathrow and Gatwick.   Related: New Brexit checks ‘pose existential threat’ to UK fruit and flower growers   The UK’s biggest sparkling wine maker benefited from a shift towards English fizz, with the category increasing retail sales by 16%, while champagne sales were down 9%, according to the market research firm Nielsen. Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Chapel Down, said: “Chapel Down is the market leader in an industry which is enjoying rapid and sustained growth, we have the strongest and most recognised brand, the deepest distribution which we continue to expand at pace, and we continue to win international acclaim for the quality of our wines.” One disappointment for Chapel Down was a 7% fall in still wine sales to £2.6m, in a competitive market that was hit by an increase in tax last year. Sales of the group’s gin and vodka were also down 7% and the company confirmed plans to exit the spirits category by April. Carter said the “fantastic, record-breaking” 2023 harvest – which was helped by a “near perfect year” for weather combined with more land in production – meant Chapel Down carried “significant momentum into the new financial year”. While wet weather delayed new planting for some vineyards last year, the lack of frost at key times across most of the country, a warm June, a wet August and a hot September all contributed to a heavy crop. Chapel Down said it had gathered in 3,811 tonnes of grapes last year, up from 2,050 tonnes in 2022, and has planted a further 47 hectares (118 acres) at its Boarley vineyard, taking its total land under vine to 366 hectares (906 acres). Wine makers have been expanding as financial investors bet on a market that has been helped by the changing climate and more professional production techniques. Michael Spencer, the former Conservative party treasurer and founder of The financial group Nex, previously known as Icap, owns more than 25% of Chapel Down. Eric Heerema, a former lawyer and asset manager, owns its biggest rival, Nyetimber, while the ex-banker Nicholas Coates founded the sparkling wine maker Coates and Seely."

Jim Mullen, who has run Reach since 2019, told staff in the meeting that they had to face the ramifications of the fact its traditional print operations have declined by 17% annually over the past four years.   Related: As editor exits, can Mirror and owner Reach survive ad crisis?   “Our biggest revenue stream is newsprint and the papers,” said Mullen, in an internal town hall video meeting with staff. “When I started I said there is at least 10 years of profitable business in newspapers and probably more. I have been in the business for five years so half of that is gone. There is probably five to seven years that we can look at. We have to face into this inconvenient truth.” Mullen said the Mirror, which now sells about 230,000 copies daily, would be “pushing” 100,000 copy sales in five years at the current rate of decline. However, Mullen said that the cost-cutting drive to move to a digital-first approach to increase online revenues – which last year declined by £21m year on year to £127.8m – would stabilise the profitability of the titles. “At the moment print, the big brother, the big sister, is supporting the digital business,” he said. “At some point in the next five to seven years, which is where we have to think of, digital will get to a point where it will repay that debt and support the print business and keep those titles running. There is a future for our titles but the future is going to be different. The titles you are passionate about at some point get to a point where they will be of minimum use on paper but will [also] exist in other forms.” Mullen said the costs associated with running print plants and distribution remain high even as copy sales fall, exacerbated by print ad revenues falling in line with reduced circulation, and that readership was “under attack every day” from factors including the shift to digital and the life expectancy of its mid to late-50s average readership. “The big one we can’t avoid, that’s nature, we die,” he said. “So, we have tracked the mortality rate and the readers are basically dying over a period of time. Also you get to 75, that’s average mortality in the UK. This may sound really dry but it is important.” He also told staff who expressed concern that the deep cuts are making it increasingly difficult to adequately cover the news comprehensively that it was a matter of “prioritisation”. “I think we have significant resources, even though we have cut them,” he said. “The question is, the argument is, we are spread too thinly. We need to accept the fact people are going to be asked to do more. We need to talk about prioritisation.” Mullen added that he had “never been involved in the editorial process” and how the cuts and “prioritisation” strategy is handled is up to editorial leadership. While he added that the deep cuts form part of a plan to ensure that this year will be free of redundancies, he could “not guarantee” there would be no more job losses if unexpected market shocks cause a faster than planned commercial deterioration. Mullen said the often-criticised overloading of webpages with ads and pop-ups is a fact of life as the business drives digital advertising to balance the decline in print. “The user experience is really straightforward, we are ad funded,” he said. “I am as disappointed as anyone else that people don’t really want to pay for our content online. Not enough of them, nowhere near enough of them. Some people struggle particularly on the websites but if we did not put those ad blocks in and did not get additional revenue in then those cuts would have to be deeper.” Asked about the strategy of flooding its websites with stories, Mullen indicated that reader engagement and the quality of articles did not drive revenues as much as volume of content. “We are in the real world,” he said. “I need to get the page views, that is the way we sell advertising blocks, and advertising blocks deliver revenue. I know it is not ideal. We don’t talk about engagement and quality. We do, but it is not in the trading report.” Reach declined to comment."

        "content": "London is capturing an ever-bigger share of the UK’s record service sector exports and government action is needed to ensure other big cities keep pace with the capital, a report says. The Resolution Foundation said London accounted for almost half of the UK’s service sector exports, with its share of the total rising from 38% to 46% between 2016 and 2021. Glasgow was the only other big city with a rise in its share of services exports, although it only exported 5% of what London did in 2021. Between 2016 and 2021, London’s services exports have grown by 47% to reach £152.2bn, the report said. Exports from the UK’s second- and fourth-largest services-exporting cities – Greater Manchester and Birmingham – also grew, but at much slower rates of 11% and 3% respectively. Britain’s economy is becoming increasingly dominated by services, which account for about 80% of national output and 56% of exports. In the third quarter of 2023, exports of services stood at £119.9bn while exports of goods were £94.3bn. The Resolution Foundation said the concentration of services exports in London contrasted with France, where growth in Bordeaux and Lille had been faster than in Paris. The report said policymakers needed to understand services exports were far more broad-based than banking for Britain’s big cities to improve their performance. In London exports of information and communications technology were up 15% between 2016 and 2021, while exports of professional services grew by 12%. Banking exports were up by 8%. The thinktank said major cities outside London had the potential to sell more services overseas but they needed “vastly” more public investment in public transport and housing, and a major expansion of city centres to accommodate more firms and high-skilled workers. Emily Fry, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said services exports were one of Britain’s secret economic success stories. “Sadly, major cities outside London have failed to share in this growth, and the capital now accounts for almost half of all Britain’s services exports. “Britain needs to build up, rather than talk down, services as a route to future economic prosperity. Tradable services aren’t just about banking, and should not be something that just happens in the capital. “We have a wide range of strengths in services – from world class universities, to accountants and entertainment industries – and getting more of our major cities to sell this to the world would boost both local living standards and national economic growth.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-23T07:00:42+00:00",
        "content": "Campaigners have spoken out against proposed changes to the law that would ease restrictions on marketing baby formula, arguing that they would not help cut prices for hard-pressed families but instead give free rein to powerful brands. The boss of Iceland, Richard Walker, has written to MPs proposing an amendment to the competition bill currently going through parliament that would remove the ban on advertising in stores, free samples, discount promotions and “any other promotional activity to induce the sale of an infant formula”. The prohibitions were introduced to avoid discouraging breastfeeding. Walker said that while breast milk “is always the best for babies” the regulations were “making it harder for families to access more affordable formula”. The competition watchdog is expected to make recommendations this summer on how to tackle profiteering in the baby formula market after an initial investigation last year found prices had risen 25% in two years. The Competition and Markets Authority found parents could save as much as £500 a year by switching brands but were reluctant to do so while competition was hampered because only one own-label alternative existed – from the cut-price chain Aldi. Families could also be buying more formula than required, the CMA said, as manufacturers’ feeding volume guides were “systematically higher” than those recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. Campaigners, including Walker, have called on the government to introduce measures such as a price cap that would control profiteering on baby milks. Alison Thewliss MP, the head of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Infant Feeding, said Walker’s proposals would enable formula makers to spend more on marketing than they already did, adding to the costs and price of their products. Brands get around the limits on advertising infant formula by promoting “growing up” milk – a type of formula targeted at toddlers who do not need a special drink to remain healthy. She said Walker’s plan “played into the hands of formula companies and I don’t see how that cuts costs for people at the till. The UK government should be challenging companies directly on how much it is costing for product that for many is an absolute essential”. Dr Vicky Sibson, the director of the First Steps Nutrition Trust (FSNT), a baby health charity, said Walker’s proposals “would not make any difference for struggling families” and could lead to the sale of unnecessary products to those on low incomes. She added: “These laws on marketing formula are there to protect all babies no matter how they are fed. Weakening those laws runs the risk of affecting babies’ health.” Sibson said enabling the use of loyalty scheme points or vouchers for the purchase of formula would not help families on low incomes, who are most affected by high prices, as they would have to spend potentially thousands of pounds in order to get enough points for a tin. The FSNT is calling for a public health campaign to highlight that the content of all infant formula is strictly regulated, no matter the price or brand, so that they are nutritionally equivalent. Prof Amy Brown of Swansea University, who has researched the marketing of baby formula, said the most simple way to cut baby formula prices was for brands to reduce their profits. “They are making huge profits and that is what needs to change,” she said. “The rules [on marketing] are there for a reason and that is because they can’t play nicely. They use [free samples and discounts] to hook people in and persuade them to buy more expensive products.”"

It would be a sharp turnaround from the last two years, when the Fed jacked its main interest rate drastically higher in hopes of slowing the economy enough to grind down high inflation. Some stronger-than-expected reports on the economy recently have forced traders to push out their forecasts for when the Fed will begin cutting rates.

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-22T18:29:36+00:00",
        "content": "Downing Street has indicated that the government will oppose Royal Mail plans to scrap Saturday letter deliveries, as the regulator assesses the possibility of cuts to the postal service. Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, is expected to publish a series of options for the future of the postal service when the results of a five-month-long review are published this week, probably on Wednesday. The watchdog is likely to lay out a number of potential changes, including cutting the Saturday services, in its review of the universal service obligation (USO) – the legislation that requires Royal Mail to deliver nationwide, six days a week at a fixed price – and a consultation will then follow. But Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said on Monday that the government “would not countenance” enabling Royal Mail to ditch its six-day-a-week letter postal service. The prime minister’s representative said: “Obviously Ofcom has a role here and is reviewing the future of Royal Mail. “But the prime minister’s strong view is that Saturday deliveries provide flexibility and convenience that are important for businesses and particularly publishers and the prime minister would not countenance seeing Saturday deliveries scrapped. “So I think we’ll see exactly what the outcomes are. But given the importance of these deliveries, particularly to businesses, it’s not something we would countenance.” Ofcom has previously said cutting Saturdays could save Royal Mail £125m to £225m a year. Its proposals could also include changing first- and second-class delivery targets, higher stamp prices, a state subsidy for Royal Mail to provide the USO and even alternate day deliveries. However, the regulator does not have the authority to order any such changes, which would require an update to the Postal Services Act 2011. Royal Mail has long argued that delivering the six-day service in its current form is unsustainable, but last year Ofcom rejected those calls before later fining the company £5.6m for missing delivery targets. The Observer revealed this month that the regulator was canvassing views on alternate day and three-day services, and a former employee said that Royal Mail’s push for a five-day service was a “red herring” before a more radical longer-term reduction in delivery days to cut costs. In a letter to MPs, the boss of Royal Mail’s parent company, Martin Seidenberg, said the USO was “simply not sustainable” and cited changes in other countries, including a move to alternate day deliveries in Germany and Italy. The Downing Street comments could cause problems for Labour if the party wins power at a general election this year as polls suggest. The party has yet to firmly assert its position on Saturday deliveries. Asked whether Labour would be content with an alternate day service, the shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, told Sky News: “No, I think it’s very worrying. There is a USO obligation, wherever you live in this country you should get a regular postal service – I think that’s still an important part of the infrastructure of our country and it’s very worrying to hear these proposals.” It is understood that Labour has been in talks with the Communication Workers Union (CWU) for 12 months and conversations are continuing over how to sustain the USO. Labour said last year it would conduct a regulatory review to improve quality of service and labour standards across the postal sector if it gained power, and opposed the breakup of Royal Mail mooted during industrial action. On Monday, the CWU said: “Ofcom have abandoned their responsibilities on quality of service and are now attempting to do the same on the USO.” The Labour backbencher and former Royal Mail employee Kate Osborne said: “Royal Mail is trying to strip away our much cherished postal service with no regard for the longer-term impact it will have on not only the workers and communities but also on businesses that rely on a six-day service.” Royal Mail reported its best Christmas in four years last week, despite missing targets that would have triggered a £500 staff bonus."

        "content": "Here it is, then, six years after the collapse of Carillion: the UK’s response to the massive governance failure at a major government contractor that folded only six months after its first profits warning. From 2026 – so after yet more delay – the boards of quoted companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange will have to declare that their firms’ internal controls are up to scratch. If this rule change sounds like a watery imitation of what was promised in the aftermath of the Carillion fiasco, you’d be right. Back then, there was a zeal to take radical measures to reform the responsibilities of company directors, as well as to shake up the entire audit industry and the audit regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Instead, in terms of what will be required of directors, we’ve ended up with a tweak to the UK corporate governance code. Companies with a premium listing in London – the only ones to which the code formally applies – already have to carry out an annual review of the effectiveness of their financial, operational, reporting and compliance controls. The new obligation will merely make boards explain how they conducted the review and what it concluded. The change isn’t nothing, but the contrast with the US is stark. Over there, they have the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was introduced within a year of their own spectacular corporate blow-up – at the energy company Enron in 2001. US companies have to involve an external auditor in the review of their controls, which is a more intrusive process, and the act carries criminal sanctions. The UK version, even in tightened form, is less onerous by several degrees. The lowering of ambition has really been led by the government. Amid the general panic about the “competitiveness” of UK plc and the declining status of the London Stock Exchange as a venue for company listings, anything that can be caricatured as bureaucratic red tape has been downgraded. The government’s mantra these days is to encourage risk-taking and growth. The FRC, in keeping rule changes “proportionate”, is merely following the script. That same script has already resulted in years of delays to the creation of the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga) as a muscular and statutory replacement for the FRC with powers to take enforcement action against all directors, not just – as at present – those who happen to be members of the accounting trade body. The failure to legislate for Arga is all part of the timid tone from Westminster. The corporate lobby has won most of the battles. An incidental benefit – let’s hope – is that we may see an end to whingeing from boardrooms about the supposedly impossible burdens placed on them by regulators and box-ticking investors. The plea never made much sense given the existence of Sarbanes-Oxley in the US. And it is even less persuasive now that the FRC has also dropped, more justifiably, earlier proposals to beef up reporting on environmental and social areas and the setting of diversity expectations. For good measure, Richard Moriarty, the chief executive of the FRC, has reminded companies that London’s “comply or explain” principle means what it says: cogent explanations for diverting from the code are allowed, and indeed are better than half-hearted compliance. That bit, at least, sounds like good sense. Company chairs are paid to make decisions and justify them. They should count their blessings: their lives have not been made impossible by regulations."

        "content": "Britain’s biggest airports are to miss the June deadline to install new security scanners, meaning the government will not be able to relax the ban on passengers carrying liquids in their hand luggage this summer. Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports Group said that they hope to complete the upgrade of their scanners by 2025. The next generation of security equipment – whose computed tomography (CT) scans provide clearer, more accurate 3D images – is already fully in use at some UK airports. At London City and Teesside, where the scanners are in use, passengers are not required to remove laptops or liquid containers from hand luggage and can take larger bottles in their carry-on cases – although they may not be able to bring them back from their destination, where other rules apply. However, in most airports liquid can only be taken through security in containers of 100ml or less under UK legislation, despite the capability of the new scanners. The Department for Transport is not expected to change its rules to allow up to 2l bottles until all airports are fully compliant. The technology should, however, speed up security, with fewer rules to delay passengers who may not be travelling with checked-in bags. Currently even small tubes of toothpaste or other toiletries have to be removed from hand luggage and put in another clear bag. Restrictions on liquids were introduced in 2006 after a plot to blow up a transatlantic flight was uncovered. The government had originally set a deadline of 2022 for the new CT scanners to be introduced, which in 2022 was pushed back to June 2024. Most UK airports have started implementation, but the weight, size, cost and training requirements for the new equipment has made it a lengthy process. Some smaller airports, many of which nearly went out of business during Covid, initially struggled to meet the multimillion-pound cost of new scanners. Other airports have had to expand buildings or replace floors to bear the weight of the substantially heavier machines. Security staff, who were in short supply in the UK during a chaotic post-pandemic recovery, also need time off to be trained, and bigger airports have struggled to find time and space to install and implement scanners while still running busy operations. Heathrow is spending about £1bn on the new equipment, having to upgrade a total of 146 security lanes across four terminals – more than all other UK airports combined. MAG, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said the scanners would be introduced “lane by lane” at its airport. A spokesperson said it was making good progress, but it was “a complex programme of work requiring the expansion of terminal facilities, while at the same time maintaining operations during construction”. It expects to have many scanners in place by June, but not complete the programme until 2025. A spokesperson for Gatwick said the airport “will have made significant progress installing state-of-the-art next-generation security scanners by June 2024 in both terminals”, and expects to complete work by spring 2025. While the government could sanction airports for non-compliance after June, it is understood to be preparing to grant extensions for businesses struggling to meet the deadline. A DfT spokesperson said: “The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience. “We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes. For security reasons we don’t talk in detail about aviation security measures.”"

        "content": "The train drivers’ union Aslef will stand down its five days of additional strikes at LNER after the state-owned operator withdrew plans to impose minimum service levels during next week’s industrial action. LNER, which runs trains on the east coast mainline from London to Scotland, had told Aslef it intended to use the controversial new laws to run trains during the initial 24-hour strike called for Friday 2 February. The union then said it would strike for another five days from 5 to 9 February, which it has now rescinded in response to the climbdown. The minimum service levels legislation passed by the Conservatives had not been tested until now. Ministers have been privately lobbying train operators to use the new powers during rolling strikes across England next week. LNER, which along with Northern and Southeastern is run by the state’s own operator, had been under particular pressure to impose minimum service levels, compelling some drivers to work during the strike and run a minimum 40% of the usual timetable. While LNER has not publicly confirmed its plans or retraction, the apparent U-turn throws further doubt over the new laws, which rail industry bosses already feared could be unworkable. No other train company has confirmed whether it would attempt to use the new laws, but it is understood that none have yet started the formal process of consultation ahead of issuing notices obliging staff to work. An LNER spokesperson said: “We welcome news that the threat of extended disruption to our services has been lifted. We encourage Aslef to work with us to find a way to end this long running dispute which only damages the rail industry.” An Aslef spokesperson said: “As LNER have withdrawn their minimum service levels, we have withdrawn our five additional days of action.” Unions in all sectors have vowed to oppose the new minimum services levels law, which they say removes the right to strike. The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “No decent employer would force workers to work during strikes – and threaten them with the sack if they fail to comply. We are clear. The full force of the union movement will stand behind any worker disciplined or sacked for exercising their right to strike. “Unions will keep fighting this spiteful legislation. We won’t stop until it is repealed.” Industrial action by train drivers will still proceed next week, but with just one 24-hour strike at LNER, in line with action across England on different days from Tuesday 30 January and Monday 5 February. Aside from LNER, drivers will strike at Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Thameslink and South Western Railway on Tuesday 30 January; at Northern Trains and TPE on Wednesday 31 January; at Greater Anglia and C2C on Friday 2 February; at West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast and East Midlands Railway on Saturday 3 February; and at Great Western, CrossCountry and Chiltern on Monday 5 February. Drivers will also work to rule across all the companies, including refusing to work overtime, throughout the strike period, which is likely to cause additional disruption for operators such as TransPennine Express that rely on rest day working."

The Conference Board Leading Economic Index fell by 0.1% in December 2023 to 103.1 (2016=100), following a 0.5 percent decline in November.   🇺🇸 CB Leading Index MoM (Dec)Actual: -0.1%Expected: -0.3%Previous: -0.5%https://t.co/BpRhCg7Tgs— DailyFX Team Live (@DailyFXTeam) January 22, 2024  This means the LEI has contracted by 2.9% over the six-month period between June and December 2023, a smaller decrease than its 4.3% contraction over the previous six months. Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators at The Conference Board, says:  “The US LEI fell slightly in December, continuing to signal underlying weakness in the US economy. “Despite the overall decline, six out of ten leading indicators made positive contributions to the LEI in December. Nonetheless, these improvements were more than offset by weak conditions in manufacturing, the high interest-rate environment, and low consumer confidence.      3.12pm GMT   Shares in London are also rallying, although they’re nowhere near a record high. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is now up 0.36%, or 26 points, today at 7,488 points, as stocks rally after their worst week since mid-October. It’s nearly a year since the Footsie broke over 8,000 points for the first time.     2.59pm GMT   Here’s Reuters' take on the drama on Wall Street today:  The S&P 500 touched a fresh record high on Monday in another session of gains for Wall Street’s major indexes, with investors monitoring the ongoing corporate earnings season and any clues on interest-rate cuts this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55.75 points, or 0.15% at the open, to 37,919.55. The S&P 500 opened higher by 13.61 points, or 0.28%, at 4,853.42, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 82.08 points, or 0.54%, to 15,393.05 at the opening bell.      2.56pm GMT   Back in the UK, train drivers’ union Aslef is standing down its five days of additional strikes at LNER, bringing some relief to passengers. The move comes after LNER, the state-owned operator, withdrew plans to impose minimum service levels during next week’s industrial action. LNER, which runs trains on the east coast main line from London to Scotland, had told Aslef it intended to use the controversial new laws to run trains during the strikes. The minimum service levels legislation passed by the Conservatives has not yet been tested until now. Ministers have been privately lobbying train operators to use the new powers during rolling strikes across all of England’s train operators next week and the LNER U-turn throws doubt over how workable the new law is in practice. While LNER has not confirmed it planned to compel some drivers to work during the strike to run a minimum 40% of the usual timetable, it is understood that its plans prompted the Aslef escalation of action announced last week, which is now to be withdrawn.

The S&P 500 index of US shares is up 0.5% at 4,863 points, up 23.7 points, and above the record highs set on Friday.  * S&P 500 HITS FRESH INTRA-DAY RECORD HIGH, LAST UP 0.4%@reuters $SPX— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) January 22, 2024  Technology stocks are continuing to rally, as investors continue to bet on tech. Western Digital Corp, the hard drive maker, is the top riser on the S&P 500, up 5.2%, with solar power company First Solar (+4.7%) close behind. Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, says hopes that the US can avoid a recession, and excitement over artificial intelligence, have both been lifting the markets:  Shares on Wall Street reached a new all-time high last week, as the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence went into overdrive and another round of solid economic data reinforced hopes that the US economy can avoid a recession. Companies with direct exposure to artificial intelligence such as Nvidia spearheaded the rally. Investors increasingly view these stocks as ‘bulletproof’ because even if the global economy loses steam, demand for AI products will still remain elevated, shielding corporate profits from any macroeconomic headwinds. Another element behind the blistering market rally was the Michigan consumer survey, where inflation expectations declined while consumer confidence improved significantly, painting a rosy picture of the American economy. The S&P 500 gained 1.2% to eclipse its previous record high, set in early 2022.  But…. the S&P 500 is being held back by US agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland. Its share have slumped 16%, after it put its chief financial officer on leave and delayed its quarterly earnings release as it investigates accounting practices in its nutrition business.     2.27pm GMT   Employees at the European Central Bank have given their president, Christine Lagarde, a thumbs-down in a staff survey, according to reports. Politico say that most participants in a trade union survey of ECB staff said they don’t think Lagarde is the right person to head the ECB now, with 50.6% of respondents ranking her overall performance in the first half of her eight-year term as “very poor” or “poor.” That’s rather worse than recent predecessors, such as Mario Draghi or Jean-Claude Trichet. Trichet only attracted “very poor” or “poor” ratings from 14.5% of respondents – even though his ECB blundered by raising eurozone interest rates in July 2008, just before the financial crisis exploded, and later threatened to cut off support for Ireland unless it sought a bailout. Compared to these blunders, what is Lagarde’s crime? Apparently, the former French finance minister and IMF chief has been using the ECB to boost her personal agenda, wading too deeply into politics, and focusing on non-core issues such as gender equality rather than the fight against inflation. Politico says (with an intriguing ‘ahem’…):  Both her predecessors also received bad marks for their handling of internal affairs, but staff were scathing about Lagarde, with almost three-quarters expressing unhappiness about her approach to management.  Some of that was mundane grumbling over things like hot desking, restrictions on working from home and, ahem, pay rises that don’t keep up with inflation. But other claims went much further.

Germany’s chemicals sector relies on Asia for around a third of its imports from outside Europe. Martina Nighswonger, CEO and owner of Gechem GmbH & Co KG, which mixes and bottles chemicals for big industrial clients, says her procurement department is currently working “three times as hard” to get hold of raw materials. As a result, Gechem has lowered production of dishwasher and toilet tablets because it can’t get enough trisodium citrate as well as sulfamic and citric acid. More here.  Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.10pm GMT   Boeing is facing more scrutiny, after the US aviation regulator recommended that airlines which operate its 737-900ER jets inspect door plugs to ensure they are properly secured. The advice came after some operators reported unspecified issues with bolts upon inspections. The recommendation follows the FAA’s grounding of 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes after the 5 January mid-air cabin blowout of a door plug on an eight-week-old Alaska Airlines Max 9 jet.

Cornwall Insight, a respected industry consultant, has forecast that average bills will fall by 16% on the previous quarter, and could reach their lowest since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The forecaster predicts that the industry price cap, representing the average annual bill for a typical household in Great Britain, will fall from its current level of £1,928 set at the start of this month by £308 to hit £1,620 from April – £40 lower than it had forecast in December. Analysts had feared that tensions in the Red Sea, where Houthi rebels have attacked vessels and upended the global shipping industry, would push up wholesale oil prices and feed through to household bills.   Related: Energy bills in Great Britain forecast to fall by 16% in April       11.59am GMT   Reuters also reports that antimony prices have hit their highest since September 2022 as European and U.S. buyers grapple with delayed shipments of the metal from Asia. Supplies of antimony, which is used in batteries and semiconductors, have been affected by disruptions on the Red Sea route. Prices of the material that is also used in the manufacture of fire-retardants, ceramics, glass and rubber products have jumped 17% from $11,350 a metric ton since December and were around $13,300 in the European spot market this month, traders said.   Related: What impact have UK and US strikes had on Red Sea shipping disruption?       11.52am GMT   German shipping group Hapag-Lloyd has also announced it will introduce land corridors to transport goods through Saudi Arabia to mitigate the impact of Red Sea disruption on its business. The move comes as Hapag-Lloyd decides to continue routing its vessels around the Cape of Good Hope until further notice (see earlier post). The company said it would offer land connections from Jebel Ali, Dammam and Jubail to its ocean shuttle service out of Jeddah, explaining:  “Our aim is to provide (customers) with a convenient contingency solution to overcome this unexpected closure until the situation in the Red Sea has been normalized.”   ⚠️  HAPAG-LLOYD TO OFFER LAND TRANSIT THROUGH SAUDI ARABIA AMID RED SEA DISRUPTION (Reuters)  German shipping group Hapag-Lloyd will continue to route its vessels around the Cape of Good Hope until further notice due to Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, it said on… pic.twitter.com/I63Qr6D2JO— PiQ (@PiQSuite) January 22, 2024   Updated at 11.55am GMT    11.39am GMT  China vows to punish officials who falsify economic data  There’s long been some scepticism about the accuracy of China’s economic data, given the pressure to hit growth targets (and, frankly, the challenge of measuring such a huge, complex system as it moves from being a command economy to a market economy). And today, the National Bureau of Statistics has declared that China will investigate and punish officials for falsifying economic data. Reuters has the details:  Fabricating economic data or interfering in statistical work by officials has persisted despite government steps in recent years to improve the quality of the data, the bureau said in a statement, citing an unidentified senior official. Officials who commit data fraud “will be found, investigated and dealt with, and will not be tolerated,” the official said. “Statistical fraud is the biggest corruption in the field of statistics, which seriously violates the statistics law, seriously affects the quality of statistical data, obstructing and even misleading macro decision-making,” the official said.      11.35am GMT   British farmers are calling on MPs to support tougher regulations to protect them from “unfair” treatment by the “big six” supermarkets. A protest by dozens of ‘scarecrows’ outside Parliament today comes as MPs are set to debate reforms to the grocery supply chain, after more than 110,000 people signed a petition pressing the Government to overhaul the grocery supply code of practice. Veg box firm Riverford Organic, which initiated the petition, said the scarecrows standing outside Parliament represented fruit and vegetable farmers who claim it is likely they will go out of business in the next 12 months, with many blaming supermarkets’ buying practices as a threat to their livelihoods. The petition calls for regulations that ensure supermarkets adhere to “fair” purchasing agreements, including buying agreed quantities and paying the agreed amount on time “without exception”. Riverford said current government policies failed to provide adequate support for farmers and were rarely enforced.     11.24am GMT   More shipping news: Danish shipping group Maersk is diverting its ME2 container service away from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Instead, the vessels will be rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope, the company said in an advisory to clients today, Reuters reports. The ME2 service links Italy and the western Mediterranean Sea to the east coast of India and the United Arab Emirates.     11.16am GMT  Full story: Top hedge funds make record $67bn in profits for 2023  Billionaire hedge fund managers Chris Hohn and Ken Griffin led the industry to record profits last year as bets on the stock market paid off handsomely for clients. The top 20 hedge fund managers made $67bn (£53bn) in profits for investors in 2023, as the industry made combined profits of $218bn, topping the previous record of $65bn set in 2021. TCI Fund Management, which is run by British billionaire Hohn, who paid himself $346m last year, topped the list making $12.9bn for clients. Citadel, founded by the US billionaire Ken Griffin, who has been involved in a bid for the Telegraph newspaper with the co-owner of GB News, ranked second, making $8.1bn.

Hapag-Lloyd says:  “We continue to monitor and review the situation constantly. As soon as the situation changes, and it is safe again we will route our vessels through Red Sea and Suez Canal.  There were concerns at the World Economic Forum last week that ongoing disruption to shipping would hit trade growth, and push up inflation. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organisation, warned Davos that trade growth this year might not hit the WTO’s 3.3% forecast, due to geopolitical conflicts, and the problems in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.  Updated at 10.52am GMT    10.48am GMT   The value of farmland in England and Wales grew twice as fast as blue-chip shares on the London stock market last year, new research shows. Knight Frank’s Farmland Index, released this morning, shows that the value of bare land in England and Wales rose by 7% in 2023, trading over £9,000/acre on average for the first time. That’s almost twice as fast as the 3.8% increase in the FTSE 100 last year. Knight Frank reckons scarcity of supply and persistent strong demand from a diverse selection of buyers supported farmland prices, in the face of high inflation, rising borrowing rates, weak commodity markets, and a decline in farm subsidies. Rising prices could also be due to the growth in the nature capital market, which provides farmers with new funding sources, such as carbon sequestration and enhancing biodiversity.  Will Matthews, Head of Farms & Estates at Knight Frank, says:  “The absence of forced sellers has certainly created a unique market dynamic. A persistent low supply makes it challenging to envision farmland trading at levels below those we’ve witnessed. The robust demand and intense competition among affluent buyers frequently pushes values to £10,000 per acre, and large blocks can even exceed £15,000 per acre.”      9.36am GMT   2023 also ended badly for German exporters. Exports from Europe’s largest economy to countries outside the European Union fell by 4.0% in December compared to November 2023, the Federal Statistical Office reports. Exports to the United States fell by 9.9% compared to December 2022, while exports to China fell by 12.7%, and exports to Russia fell by 32.3% compared to the same month last year. But, German exports to the United Kingdom increased by 19.7% year-on-year.     9.08am GMT   Stocks have opened a little higher in London this morning, at the start of a new week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has gained 16 points, or 0.2%, to 7479, which still leaves it down 3.2% so far this year after a weak start to 2024. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms has gained 0.7%, led by thermal processing specialist Bodycote (+4%) which announced a £60m share buyback programme this morning after completing the takeover of US rival Lake City HT for less than expected. Investors are in a somewhat upbeat mood, after rising tech shares lifted the US S&P 500 to a record high on Friday. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says UK markets also joined the bullish turnaround this morning, albeit at a more measured pace, adding:  The FTSE100 was buoyed by a broad mark-up which included a broker upgrade for Segro. In addition, retailers recovered some poise with gains for the likes of Ocado, JD Sports and Kingfisher ahead of a week which will see an update from Primark owner Associated British Foods. A broker downgrade to Sage scuppered what little hopes there may have been for strength in UK tech stocks, such as they are.      8.57am GMT   There’s also a little takeover drama in the City today. British catering firm Compass Group is has agreed a deal to buy rival CH&CO, as it looks to expand its UK and Ireland business. CH&CO, which caters to sectors including businesses, sports and universities, is one of the royal warrant holders for catering services ,and cates for some iconic and landmark venues including the Royal Opera House, Kew Gardens, and Abbey Road Studios.

Trifast, which makes high end industrial fastenings such as bolts, nuts, screws, rivets and washers, is cutting 10% of its non-operational staff worldwide, after concluding that results this year will be “significantly below” its previous expectations. Trifast says demand was “volatile” in the last quarter, including significantly lower than forecasted volumes in December. It told the City that demand was slowing, as “geopolitical events” also hit sales, saying:  The more testing environment that we are now experiencing in 2024 in terms of growth is being severely impacted by a further slowdown in customer demand and volumes across the business and to an extent by the reported macro-economic challenges and geopolitical events.   #TRI Another Day Another Profit Warning ⚠️ A nasty start to the week for Trifast shareholders with revenue to be significantly below expectations at £230mJob losses looming for c10% of the staff, sad to see 😢 pic.twitter.com/nb568Ijeoq— Aston Girl (@reb40) January 22, 2024  Shares in Trifast have dropped 20% in early trading. This is the third profit warning from the company in 15 months. It warned in October 2022 that underlying profits would miss market expectations, then in Febuary 2023 it announced annual profit would fall well below market expectations, and the surprise departure of its CEO.     8.09am GMT  Sorrell: Geopolitical issues are worrying clients  2023 was a difficult year for S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s technology-focused digital advertising, marketing and technology services firm. S4 has reported this morning that it expects its like-for-like net revenues fell by 4% in 2023 , as cautious clients – particularly in the technology sector – cut back on spending. Sorrell told Radio 4’s Today programme that last year was ‘tougher’ than in the previous four years since he founded S4. But, the outlook this year is slightly better. Sorrell says:  This time last year, clients were looking at interest rates rising. The slightly better news this year is that they are now looking at interest rates as falling.  Inflation is coming down quite sharply. It may not reach the core rates that central banks wish, ie 2%, but we’ll see how we go through the year  Sorrell adds that here is a “conflict” between what’s happening economically, and politically, explaining that geopolitical issues are worrying clients:  The three big issues that absorb our clients, or worry our clients, are firstly around US-China relationships, or lack of them, secondly Russia and Ukraine, and third and not least Iran and what’s happening in Gaza with Israel and Hamas. There are other things as well, but those three obsess them.   Interesting commentary from #SFOR @S4Capital.

They hit 870p in September 2021, before falling through 2022 and 2023.     7.25am GMT  25% rise in UK firms in critical financial distress  Accountancy firm Begbies Traynor has reported a sharp jump in businesses in ‘critical’ financial distress in the final quarter of last year. Its latest Red Flag Alert report has found that there were more than 47,000 businesses near collapse in the UK at the start of 2024. That’s a 25% jump on the 37,722 recorded at the end of Q3 2023, and the second quarter in a row in which critical financial distress grew by about a quarter. Critical financial distress grew rapidly in the last quarter in the Construction (+32.6%), Health & Education (+41.3%), Real Estate & Property Services (+24.7%) and Support Services (+23.6%) sectors. Begbies Traynor adds that “serious concerns” are growing about the construction and real estate sectors which still represent nearly 30% of all businesses in critical financial distress. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, says the ‘perfect storm’ of high interest rates, rampant inflation, weak consumer confidence and rising and unpredictable input costs are hitting every corner of the economy. Palmer adds:  Now that the era of cheap money is firmly a thing of the past, hundreds of thousands of businesses in the UK, who loaded up on affordable debt during those halcyon days, are now coming to terms with the added burden this will have on their finances. “For some, a better-than-expected Christmas may kick these concerns down the road for a little longer, but the rapid growth in the levels of critical financial distress point to an economy that is waking up to the danger of debt ladened businesses in a higher rates environment.   Updated at 7.53am GMT    7.11am GMT  Share price surge helps largest hedge funds to biggest profits on record  Recession fears haven’t prevented top hedge funds from recording bumper profits last year. New data shows the world’s most successful hedge funds made their biggest profits on record last year. Punchy bets on stock markets paid off when share prices surged at the end of 2023, when markets were lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts. The Financial Times reports:  The top 20 managers made profits for investors of $67bn in 2023 according to research by LCH Investments — up from the previous record of $65bn in 2021.

Updated at 7.11am GMT    7.10am GMT   Today’s forecasts suggest the UK’s period of economic stagnation is slowly coming to an end, adds Hywel Ball, EY UK Chair. Ball says:  Households and businesses are still facing a tough outlook in 2024, due in part to the lagged effect of interest rate rises, but slowing inflation and anticipated Bank Rate cuts should help build economic momentum as the year progresses.  Business investment, which has been disappointing for some time, is also expected to see a resurgence in the medium term, Ball adds:  A modest contraction is forecast for 2024, but this should be followed by a revival in capital expenditure in subsequent years. Falling inflation and declining market interest rates, coupled with the potential for additional tax cuts in the Chancellor’s spring budget, suggest the UK is at a turning point in 2024 and about to enter a more positive phase of growth.”   Updated at 7.51am GMT    7.09am GMT  Introduction: \"Good chance\" UK fell into technical recession  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain may well have slipped into recession at the end of last year, forecasters at the EY ITEM Club believe. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club said this morning “there’s a good chance” the economy may have shrunk slightly in the final three months of 2023. That would mean two negative quarters in a row – after the 0.1% fall in GDP in July-September – meaning a technical recession. EY ITEM Club have slashed their forecasts for growth in 2023 to just 0.3%, down from 0.6%. Beck told Radio 4’s Today Programme:  We know that GDP - gross domestic product - shrunk in the third quarter and looking at the high frequency numbers for Q4, there’s a good chance that it may have shrunk slightly again.  The official GDP data for the October-December quarter are due on 15 February. Headlines declaring the UK in recession would not be good news for the government, as the Conservatives try to plot a tricky path to another election win. But, as Beck points out, “it doesn’t make a massive amount of difference to the person on the street” if the economy shrank by 0.1% or grew by 0.1%. And looking ahead, EY ITEM Club are more optimistic about the UK’s future prospects, helped by slowing inflation and likely interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. Beck says:  We should end 2024 on a happier note than 2023.  The group now expects the economy to grow by 0.9% in 2024, up from the 0.7% growth projected in October. And next year, growth is seen hitting 1.8% (up from 1.7% forecast three months ago). That’s better news for Rishi Sunak, and chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who is working on his next budget statement which is likely to include tax cuts.

        "content": "The US oil company ExxonMobil has filed a lawsuit to block a vote on a climate resolution brought by a green activist, in move that will be watched closely by fossil fuel companies worldwide. The company hopes to stop investors voting on a motion put forward by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group, which called for Exxon to accelerate its attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The company filed the lawsuit at a US district court in Texas on Sunday, arguing that the proposal violates SEC investor petition rules. It asked the court to make a decision by 19 March, before its annual meeting on 29 May.   Related: Rishi Sunak facing renewed pressure over plans to ‘max out’ North Sea oil   The move will be followed closely by other oil and gas companies and green groups, as environmental campaigners attempt to hold the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies to account for their emissions. Follow This, which put the motion forward with the investment adviser Arjuna Capital, has registered motions at a series of oil companies’ annual general meetings for years, in a campaign to tighten their commitments to reducing their emissions. Shell is facing a rebellion from investors that own about 5% of its shares over a Follow This resolution at this year’s AGM, after a chaotic meeting disrupted by green campaigners last year. It is unclear whether Exxon also sent a “no action letter” to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the typical route taken by listed companies attempting to stop a vote on a resolution. The company has argued that the Follow This and Arjuna proposal breaks the US regulator’s rules designed to prevent shareholders being able to “micromanage” businesses’ decisions through proposals. The SEC has come under pressure for allowing environmental groups to register too many motions at annual shareholder meetings, after it revoked policies adopted by the Donald Trump administration. Last year, ExxonMobil announced it planned to reach net zero by 2050 for greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations. In 2021, an activist hedge fund, Engine No 1, won three seats on Exxon’s board at its annual meeting after demanding it reduced its emissions more quickly. An Exxon spokesperson said: “The breakdown of the shareholder proposal process, one that allows proponents to advance their agendas through a flood of proposals, does not serve the interests of investors. “We are simply asking the court to apply the SEC’s proxy rules as written to stop this abuse and eliminate the significant resources required to address them.” Mark van Baal, of Follow This, said: “With this remarkable step, ExxonMobil clearly wants to prevent shareholders using their rights. Apparently, the board fears shareholders will vote in favour of emissions reductions targets. We don’t know why ExxonMobil took this remarkable step.” In the UK, ExxonMobil’s subsidiary Esso Petroleum Company (EPC) owns the Fawley oil refinery in Hampshire as well as a fuel distribution business. There are 1,200 Esso branded forecourts in the UK, of which 197 are company owned. Accounts filed at Companies House this month showed EPC’s pre-tax profits surged from £150m in 2021 to £864m, while turnover more than doubled, from £6.3bn to £13.7bn. The group’s UK operations paid a £440m dividend to its US parent in September 2023, the accounts show. “Turnover was significantly higher due to the economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic, driving up both volumes and prices,” the directors said. EPC’s gross emissions in 2022 increased by more than 5% to 2.81m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, up from 2.66m in 2021."

        "content": "New cars in the EU and UK have grown 1cm wider every two years, the Guardian can reveal, driven by large luxury SUVs whose sales show no sign of slowing. “It’s unrelenting,” said James Nix, an analyst at the Transport and Environment (T&E) campaign group and author of the report. “Spurred on by sales of the largest SUVs, vehicles are getting wider every year.” New cars have become so bloated that half of them are too wide to fit in parking spaces designed to the minimum on-street standards in many countries, the report found. The average width of a new car in the EU and UK passed 180cm in the first half of 2023, having grown an average of 0.5cm each year since 2001. “That may not sound like a huge figure,” said Nix. “But the reality is that – unless there is reform – a cohort of large luxury SUVs and pickups will become as wide as trucks and buses.”   Related: Paris is saying ‘non’ to a US-style hellscape of supersized cars – and so should the rest of Europe | Alexander Hurst   Big cars are more likely than small cars to kill people in crashes because they weigh more and have tall front ends that trap victims beneath them instead of knocking them to the side. They also pump more toxic gas into the air and eat up more space on roads and pavements. For some cars that were originally designed decades ago, the need to incorporate safety features like airbags and crumple zones are part of the reason that newer models have grown bigger. But the recent trend is driven by consumers buying far larger cars that make roads more dangerous.  Interactive  In the mid-1990s, the EU banned vehicles wider than 2.55 metres to stop trucks and buses from growing too large. But the legislation did not create separate limits for cars, which analysts say have started to cross key thresholds for which roads and cities were not designed. Ahead of a planned revision of EU vehicle rules, campaigners have called on lawmakers to support a clause that would make the European Commission review the width limit. They argue that the trend towards bigger cars has reduced the space for other road users and increased the danger. Crash data from Belgium from 2017 to 2021 shows that a 10cm increase in the height of vehicle fronts raises the risk of death by 30% when a car hits a pedestrian or cyclist, according to a study by the Vias Institute, previously the Belgian Institute for Road Safety. Nix, who is based in Brussels and has two young children, said: “I have three- and five-year-old kids and we’re all about encouraging them to cycle. But I – as a man in my mid-40s – am becoming ever more intimidated by particularly large oncoming vehicles in streets in Brussels.” The growth in car size also causes issues for their drivers. The report found that large luxury SUVs, which are around 2 metres wide, no longer fit in off-street parking. They also leave too little space for passengers to get in and out of vehicles in typical off-street spaces, which are around 2.4 metres wide, the report found.  Interactive  Giulio Mattioli, a transport researcher at Technical University Dortmund, said: “Too much urban space is allocated to cars in cities – including free parking at the taxpayers’ expense for which little justification exists.” Even in trailblazing capitals such as Paris and Barcelona, which have fought hard to reclaim roads for people to walk, bike and relax, more than half of street space is reserved for cars. On top of that, said Mattioli, cars in many cities are sometimes parked illegally, with little enforcement of parking rules. “The fact that cars are getting bigger is likely to make the situation even worse,” said Mattioli. “It could also lead policymakers and planners to increase the standard measures of parking spaces, which could result in a vicious circle of ever-increasing size of cars.” Paris may become the first big European capital to tackle this trend next month when it holds a referendum on higher parking charges for heavier cars. A similar scheme is set to start in Lyon in the coming months. France has fought the trend towards heavier cars more than most of Europe’s big economies. Since 2008, it has provided a financial bonus to people buying a cleaner car and a malus, or penalty, to people buying a dirtier one. In 2022, the government extended the system to apply penalties that cover the weight of a car. “That’s definitely one way to go because it could be budget-neutral,” said Gracia Brückmann, a transport policy researcher at the University of Bern. “[That] makes it easier to sell it to the public or taxpayer.”"

        "content": "More than 47,000 UK companies are on the brink of collapse after a 25% jump in the number of businesses facing “critical” financial distress in the final three months of 2023, according to a report. It marks the second consecutive quarter-on-quarter period when critical financial distress has risen by a 25%, the latest “Red Flag” report by insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor found. The construction and property sectors accounted for 30% of all businesses facing critical financial distress. The quarterly rate of increase in the number of companies facing critical financial distress grew by 32.6% in the construction industry, by 41.3% in health and education, a quarter in real estate and property services and 24% in support services. Eighteen of the 22 sectors covered by the report recorded double-digit percentage growth in the number of firms whose finances have reached critical condition. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said the tough macroeconomic conditions had created a “perfect storm” for UK businesses. “After a difficult year for British businesses that was characterised by high interest rates, rampant inflation, weak consumer confidence and rising and unpredictable input costs, we are now seeing this perfect storm impact every corner of the economy,” she said. The Bank of England raised interest rates from 0.1% at the end of 2021 to 5.25% to try to tame inflation. That has significantly increased the cost of borrowing for UK businesses, preventing many from papering over the cracks with cheap debt. “Hundreds of thousands of businesses in the UK, who loaded up on affordable debt during those halcyon days, are now coming to terms with the added burden this will have on their finances,” Palmer added. “Sadly, for tens of thousands of British businesses who should be looking ahead with some degree of optimism, the new year will bring a fight for survival.” The report found that 539,900 UK firms were facing “significant” financial stress by the end of last year, up by 12.9% on the third quarter of 2023. Most firms facing critical financial distress were based in London and the south-east, with the fewest in the north-east and Northern Ireland. “Last year, the number of firms going bust had already reached the highest level since the great financial crisis [of 2008],” said Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “A big chunk of those firms sending up alarm signals are expected to collapse over the next year, adding to expectations that a recession in the UK is imminent.” Top 10 sectors with firms facing ‘critical’ financial distress  Construction (7,849) Support services (7,096) Real estate & property services (6,228) Professional services (4,347) General retailers (3,133) Telecoms & IT (2,830) Health & education (2,719) Media (1,828) Financial services (1,373) Food & drug retailers (1,343) "

        "content": "Billionaire hedge fund managers Chris Hohn and Ken Griffin led the industry to record profits last year as bets on the stock market paid off handsomely for clients. The top 20 hedge fund managers made $67bn (£53bn) in profits for investors in 2023, as the industry made combined profits of $218bn, topping the previous record of $65bn set in 2021. TCI Fund Management, which is run by British billionaire Hohn, who paid himself $346m last year, topped the list making $12.9bn for clients. Citadel, founded by the US billionaire Ken Griffin, who has been involved in a bid for the Telegraph newspaper with the co-owner of GB News, ranked second, making $8.1bn. The list, compiled by the research company LCH since 2012, examines which money managers in the $4tn hedge fund industry are the most successful based on overall profits in absolute dollar terms they have made for investors, excluding fees. The top 20 firms oversee less than one-fifth of the industry’s assets, but generated about one-third of the overall $218bn gained for clients. The report found that over the past three years the top 20 star hedge fund managers have generated 83% of the gains made by the industry as a whole. “These managers have been generating above average performance over several decades reflecting the persistence of their superior returns,” said Rick Sopher, the chair of LCH. “In most cases this reflects an ability to limit the downside in adverse conditions and to make money when conditions are favourable, as they were toward the end of 2023.” The strong performance of the stock market had carried into the new year with the S&P 500 index of leading shares hitting an all-time high on Friday, driven by the strength of tech stocks. TCI, which ended last year up by 33%, counts Google-owner Alphabet, Visa and General Electric among its largest holdings. Other major hedge funds include Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking, which made $6bn last year, and the US billionaire Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, which rejoined the top 20 making $3.5bn. TCI and Pershing Square are the newest funds on the list while Citadel sits among the long standing, founded by Griffin in Chicago in 1990. The research found that the top 20 managers have created $755.4bn in profits since they were set up, more than the $655.5bn in assets they have under management."

        "content": "People in Aberdeen are a total of £45,000 worse off since 2010 after suffering the worst growth performance in the UK over the last decade, according to a report exposing the dangers of dependency on the fossil fuel industry amid the climate crisis. Warning that every part of the UK had been “levelled down” after years of weak economic growth, the Centre for Cities said the Scottish oil and gas capital had lost out the most of the 63 UK towns and cities it had analysed. Aberdeen was one of the most prosperous places in Britain after an energy industry boom in the 2000s, with about a third of jobs in its export base – the part of the economy that trades with the rest of the UK and the world – directly related to oil and gas.   Related: UK workers will be worse off in 2024 than in 2019, thinktank warns   However, the granite city has suffered over the past decade from an energy sector slump amid the US shale oil revolution, highlighting the risks of being dependent on an industry exposed to increasingly volatile global shifts. The Centre for Cities said near-stagnant progress across the UK since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 had left people with £10,200 less to spend or save on average than if the economy had grown at pre-2010 trends. However, there were differences in the size of shortfall for some towns and cities, and Aberdeen had experienced a shortfall more than four times the national average. The people of Burnley were also out of pocket; there, the average person was £28,090 worse off, while people in Cambridge and Milton Keynes were poorer to the tune of £21,000. Highlighting Aberdeen’s boom and bust tendencies, the report said gross disposable income per head in the city was £45,240 lower on average than it would have been if the local economy had continued to grow at the rate seen between 1998 and 2010.   Related: Rishi Sunak facing renewed pressure over plans to ‘max out’ North Sea oil   “Aberdeen has gone from being one of the best performers to [having] a pretty disastrous decade,” said Paul Swinney, the director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities. “All of this stems from over-reliance on one industry, which has knock-on effects.” The report found that while an estimated 9,000 jobs had been lost in areas connected with oil and gas, this was likely to have affected the amount of money spent in the city and hurt other areas. The city suffered a 30% drop in retail jobs, compared with a 6% downturn nationally. House prices have also been hit, with prices only 3.4% higher in 2022 than in 2010, compared to a 50% rise nationally. It comes as Rishi Sunak doubles down on anti-green policies to create a wedge issue with Labour before the general election, while pushing to advance North Sea oil and gas exploration to “max out” the UK’s reserves. However, economists – including the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney – have warned that the strategy could cause Britain to fall behind its global competitors amid the transition away from fossil fuels, while leaving the nation too heavily invested in the “sunset industries” of the past. Swinney said the UK had painful past experience of the transition away from industries including coal and shipbuilding during the 1970s and 1980s. “Notwithstanding the shorter-term policies the government has announced, you would expect that oil and gas is not going to play as big a role in the next 50 years as it has in the last. The question for Aberdeen and the rest of the country is about the transition.”"

        "content": "The UK economy will benefit from falling inflation and lower interest rates in the second half of the year, boosting growth and allowing the government to offer pre-election giveaways, according to a study by a leading forecaster. Handing Rishi Sunak a new year boost, the advisory business EY Item Club, which is sponsored by the accountancy firm EY, said its winter forecast showed that a long period of economic stagnation “should begin to fade this year as falling inflation, potential interest rate cuts and tax reductions create momentum for growth in 2024 and 2025”. Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hinted last week that a budget statement in March was likely to include tax cuts, building on the reduction in national insurance that was promised in last November’s autumn statement and which took effect on 6 January.   Related: Can tax cuts save the Tories? – podcast   Further tax cuts could feature in the 2024 autumn statement before a general election expected before the end of the year, if the recovery proceeds as predicted. The report shrugged off the likelihood of a recession in the second half of last year and the possibility of a further three months of negative growth in the first quarter of 2024, saying the underlying signs of a recovery would soon take effect. An increase in gross domestic product of 0.7% in 2024 made in the firm’s autumn forecast was upgraded to 0.9%, while the UK economy is now forecast to grow by 1.8% in 2025, up from the 1.7% predicted in October. Last year’s growth was downgraded from 0.6% to 0.3%, emphasising a loss of momentum in the second half of the year owing to persistently high inflation and sharply higher interest rates. Yet a recession is still possible if the economy is shown to have in the fourth quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.3% in the third quarter. Several economists said last week that a surprise 3.2% drop in retail sales in December revealed a level of weakness in consumer spending that could drag the economy backwards in the fourth quarter. Financial markets expect the situation to improve once inflation – which averaged above 6% in 2023 – falls as expected to 2% by April, and for the Bank of England to begin cutting interest rates in June. A report by Lloyds Bank found that seven out of 14 sectors of the economy reported growing demand, as measured by new orders, in December 2023, more than twice as many as in November 2023. A bounceback in the moribund property market, high levels of demand for flights and holidays and rising disposable incomes after a long period of decline were all credited with giving business a lift in confidence. “Business optimism reached the highest level since May as 12 out of 14 sectors reported higher confidence levels about their output prospects for 2024 compared to the same time the year before,” the report said. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said that despite fears of a recession last year and weak Christmas shopping figures, the UK’s economic outlook had “improved markedly” over the last 12 months.  The EY Item Club said interest rates should fall from 5.25% to 4% by the end of the year. Martin Beck, the club’s chief economic adviser, said: “Although it remains possible that the UK may have slipped into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2023, the mood music around the economy is justifiably improving. “High inflation and expensive borrowing costs have been two of the biggest obstacles to growth recently and, with both showing encouraging signs of subsiding, prospects for late 2024 and beyond appear brighter.” However, he warned there were risks that his forecast could be undermined by global events. “Ongoing geopolitical tensions could push up energy prices, which may slow the decline of inflation and increase costs for households and businesses. “Plus, while the Bank of England is expected to reduce interest rates this year, the timing and extent of these cuts remain uncertain and continued high rates could prolong financial strain. The first half of 2024 should tell us a lot about the UK’s prospects of returning to growth over the medium to long term.” "

The auditors at Moore Kingston Smith also unexpectedly resigned just days after the company released delayed its financial filings for 2021. The auditor had been appointed only a year earlier. The problems at the UK’s second largest steelmaker could threaten a large number of the jobs of its 4,500-strong workforce, compounding the pain for Britain’s steel industry, which is already grappling with Tata Steel’s planned shutdown of two blast furnaces at Port Talbot. The decision by the Indian-owned firm will result in up to 2,800 job losses, and has been condemned as a “devastating blow” by the Community union. In an earnings report released more than a year after they were due at Companies House, the auditor warned that British Steel “need further funding from its ultimate parent company”, Jingye, which rescued the firm from collapse in March 2020. While the company’s directors said they were confident that they would have enough funding for the following 12 months – effectively to the end of 2022 – auditors said there was “material uncertainty” over its ability to continue operating without another cash injection. The Scunthorpe-based company reported a loss of £51m for 2021, having reported a £268m profit a year earlier, due in part to a sudden surge in energy costs in October, which the company said had a “significantly adverse impact on product margins”. Auditors also signalled that they were unable to “satisfy ourselves” over the existence of £45.8m worth of stock, despite trying to verify it through “alternative means”. Filings at Companies House now indicate that Moore Kingston Smith has resigned from its role, just days after the release of the report, and a year after its predecessor, Mazars, quit due to disagreements over fees. British Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Related: Top US economists are often wrong – should we trust their predictions? | Gene Marks   To a man – and one woman – the Republican candidates all say that the US economy is bad and that Americans are struggling financially. They’re warning about sky-high deficits, over-the-top government spending and a potentially catastrophic level of national debt. They point out that interest rates are at a 20-year high and the costs of core things like food, gas and housing are significantly more than they were just a few years ago. They point to a downturn in manufacturing and falling small business confidence. “Bidenomics is crushing American families,” said the Republican candidate Nikki Haley. “We’re paying more for gas, groceries and other basic necessities.” “I’ll rip up Bidenomics on day one of my presidency,” the Florida governor and presidential challenger Ron DeSantis warned. Yes, prices and rates are up. But really? Is the economy so bad? I’m a Republican and a small business owner with hundreds of clients in many industries and honestly the economy isn’t that bad. In fact, it’s been really, really good. Just ask Donald Trump, who implicitly admitted this when he recently said he hoped for a “crash” and that it would “be in the next 12 months because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover”. If you don’t believe me, just look at the numbers. Last quarter’s gross domestic product showed growth of 5.2%. That’s a number that dwarfs all other pre-Covid recovery numbers in recent memory. Unemployment is at a record low. Each month the economy is adding hundreds of thousands of new jobs. There are millions of more open jobs available today compared with 2019. Yes, prices are higher, but inflation is down from a 9% annual rate to about 3%, so whatever the Federal Reserve did to offset the treasury’s spending on fiscal programs seems to be working. The stock market is near all-time highs, as is household wealth. Credit card delinquency rates are lower than they’ve been for the past 30 years as are delinquencies on all loans across the banking system. Holiday retail sales were strong and online sales boomed. Plenty of capital is available for businesses that need it and corporations have more cash on hand than in any year before the pandemic. I speak to dozens of industry associations each year and here’s what I’m hearing: just about everyone had a good 2023. The CEOs of our major banks reported strong earnings, after taking into consideration special assessments and one-time charges. Retailers and restaurants have recovered from the pandemic. Convention traffic in Vegas is back to normal. There are almost as many travelers through the airports as there were before Covid. Businesses in the service industries recorded their 12th consecutive month of growth. Sure, there are struggles. Businesses in the real estate industry are challenged by high housing prices and a 13-year low in home sales. Manufacturing has been in contraction for the past 14 months. Media companies are flailing. Technology firms are struggling to find financing. The cost of capital is slowing down financing for small businesses. However, we live in a giant country. California’s economy is as large as that of the entire United Kingdom. North Carolina’s economy is bigger than Sweden’s. Texas’s is bigger than Canada’s. Not every business is going to be doing well in an economy this size. There will always be those that are struggling, be it because of their location, their industry, or the makeup of their customer and supplier base. There are plenty of things that could knock things off course in 2024. Wars. Oil prices. A terrorist attack. Another pandemic. If you want to find the bad in the economy you can do it. And that’s what all the Republican candidates are doing and fair enough, it’s an election year. It’s also true that Bidenomics may not be the reason behind our strong economy. But saying the US economy is bad just isn’t true no matter who you vote for."

        "content": "Not bad. But not great either. That summed up the mood as the World Economic Forum ended in Davos last Friday with a panel on the state of the global economy. Not bad because most countries outperformed expectations of a year ago. Not bad because sharply rising interest rates didn’t plunge the US, the eurozone and the UK into recession. Not bad because the war between Israel and Hamas has failed to send oil prices shooting above $100 a barrel. Not great because central banks face a balancing act between cutting interest rates too quickly and reigniting inflation, and keeping them too high and plunging their economies into recession. Not great, because the early weeks of 2024 have led to a wider Middle East conflict, with implications for one of the world’s main trade routes. And not great because – as Davos showed – the global economy is deeply fractured. Inevitably, there is a risk that things will turn out badly in 2024. One leading global policymaker, speaking privately, said that repeated blows since 2020 meant it would be wise to be braced for the next surprise shock. Only the most incurable Davos optimist would quibble with that.   Related: As a global energy crisis returns the UK push for a green economy makes even more sense | Richard Partington   Washington and Beijing are in a grim struggle for economic supremacy. The gap between north and south is widening, and liberal democracy is being challenged by a new breed of autocrats. The planet continues to heat up. In a week that marks the 100th anniversary of Lenin’s death, there are once again competing visions of what constitutes progress and success. Even so, the death of globalisation has been much exaggerated. The reach of the multinational companies and the banks that continue to flock to the World Economic Forum were evidence of that. As is the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), part of a tech revolution that cuts across borders and which is leaving national regulators floundering in its wake. A year ago, ChatGPT was in its infancy. This year, AI was central to the Davos debate, with those hailing its potential to help solve pressing problems – such as the climate crisis – ranged against those warning of its risks. So globalisation is not dead, nor even on its last legs. The same goes for the demise of western liberal democracy. To be sure, productivity has been weak and living standards have been squeezed in recent years. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, raised eyebrows when he said his country was the tired man of Europe. But there are good reasons why there are no TV pictures of asylum seekers trying to get into Russia or China. What is true is that having been pushed on to the defensive, global capitalism is morphing into something different. Peak globalisation – along with peak Davos – happened a while ago, around the time of the global financial crisis of 2008, but it has been the repeated shocks since 2020 that have changed the dynamic. Everything that has happened since the arrival of the Covid pandemic has pointed to a new paradigm: some call it de-globalisation, others call it – perhaps more accurately – “glocalisation”. An ugly term, glocalisation is not the global free market, and it is not autarky (a nation that operates in a state of self-reliance), but something in between. It involves shorter supply chains, an emphasis on building back domestic manufacturing capacity, and a more strategic role for government. As with any form of mixed economy, the degree of glocalisation varies from country to country. Where once Davos lionised frictionless supply chains stretching from China to the developed countries of Europe and North America, now there is a recognition that low cost is not everything and that there is value in governments knowing that they will not run short of vaccines, protective equipment, computer chips and energy. The attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, necessitating much longer journeys around the Cape of Good Hope is the latest example of how vulnerable long supply chains have become. As Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said at the final Davos session: “We were relying on efficiency over security a little too much.” Lagarde noted, correctly, that a bit of rebalancing was no bad thing. The long-term causes of glocalisation lie in the increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China – a relationship that has been deteriorating since Washington woke up to the threat posed by China’s rapid growth and its clearly signalled plan to use its economic power to challenge the US’s global hegemony. The US Chips Act and the Inflation Reduction Act are both examples of American determination to rebuild its industrial base through active government intervention. But while the shift towards onshoring previously outsourced production would have happened anyway, it has certainly been accelerated by the events of the past four years: a pandemic, then supply chain bottlenecks, a surge in inflation, and the war in Ukraine. The upshot is that industrial policy is no longer a dirty word, even in Davos. Indeed, there was plenty of interest at the WEF in what Labour’s plans to boost the supply side of the UK amounted to. Nick Stern, author of the seminal report on the economics of climate change, thinks there is a potential sweet spot where the demands for stronger growth and the fight against global heating intersect. AI, he says, can act as an accelerator to help developing countries both with climate change mitigation and adaptation. He is not blind to the pushback by the fossil fuel industry against steps to combat global heating, but thinks the positives outweigh the negatives. Stern insists investing for good green projects would be good for growth and fiscally responsible. A green light for Labour’s green growth plan, in other words. And glocalisation in action."

        "content": "It was August 2020 and I was back in my family home in Sydney. Prior to that I’d been living in Manchester, doing my PhD in autobiographical women’s literary theory. I am aware that my chosen area of focus could be read as a hubristic exercise in solipsism (and maybe it is), but mostly I just wanted to be paid to read books by women for three years, so sue me. Manchester is a cold, dark, wonderful place, but the pandemic made it hell for me. I didn’t have a support network, there was no vaccine in sight, the university was closed and I was sharing a small home with a hypochondriac. It feels like “don’t move in with a hypochondriac during a global pandemic” is part of a joke setup but, unfortunately, that joke was my life. So I packed my bags, got on a few planes to Sydney, and did the two weeks of mandatory quarantine in a government-commandeered hotel. I asked my friend who once spent a few years in jail how he recommended I pass the time. He told me to be unconscious as much as possible, so mostly I just drank wine and took sleeping pills, occasionally checking in on the progress of the building site I could see from my window. Eventually, 14 days of confinement passed and then there I was, back in the southern hemisphere, living in the country I had chosen to leave. The best part of doing an English PhD is the pub after a day’s work, drinking and talking with other PhD students who have also spent the last seven hours silently battering their heads against discourse. In Sydney, I did not have this. Day after day, I would sit at the desk I had grown up at and I would work away at my thesis, reading journal articles about feminist hermeneutics and feeling very, very lonely. Something had to change. I needed a place where I was needed – a place I could go and serve a purpose and remember I was a human being with a body and not just a brain. I got a job as a casual retail assistant at a bookstore. I sold products to people and I shelved those products and I cleaned window displays and I counted cash at the end of the day. And you know what? That retail job saved my life.   I know mutual care can exist in any work environment, but I’ve never experienced it as much as I have on the shop floor   Retail work gets a bad rap and for fair reasons. The hours are precarious, it’s usually minimum wage, the jobs are often tedious and customers are, contrary to popular belief, often wrong. According to the most recent Australian census, “retail assistant” is the top recorded occupation in the nation. It’s also one of the lowest paid and it is extremely female-skewed. In the UK, the retail sector is the largest private-sector employer and the stats are similar on low wage and gender. Working retail can suck: the poverty, the sexism, the daily condescension from customers… none of these things are good. I remember one time I was working as a sales assistant at a clothing retailer and I gave a confused customer directions to the bathroom. I tried to verbally empathise with her predicament by noting that the location of the toilets was “discombobulating”. She asked me how I knew that word. A friend of mine who works at a high-end boutique told me that she often knocks over piles of clothes, just so she can refold them for something to do. My first job was at a bar frequented by a lot of older men – without fail, they would order “a black, a blonde and oh – a beer.” I had to smile politely. And yet. The camaraderie and solidarity I established with my fellow workers over the two years I worked at the bookshop was the stuff of life. There, on the shop floor, we were each other’s confidantes, we were comrades in arms, we were good to each other. Without the tiered corporate hierarchy of office work always looming, telling us that we needed to compete to aim for promotions and without the neoliberal pretence that our jobs were somehow crucial to the formation of our innermost selves, we saw each other as fellow fighters in the capitalist trenches. We were able to ridicule systems that presented jobs as rewards. We had fun. My colleagues were mostly students, like me, working so they could afford rent while they pursued further education. At 27, I was almost a store elder, regaling the youths with my tales of dial-up and trucker caps. My colleagues became my friends and we learned from each other. Standing behind the counter is like inhabiting a performative, liminal space. You can adopt different personas depending on your mood, or on the vibe of the customer you’re serving. I could be charming, I could be dense, I could be deadpan, depending on what I thought each customer deserved. There is power in service. One customer requested a book about “effectively managing staff”. I grabbed a nearby copy of Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism and said, dumbly, “Sorry, is this what you meant?” If people were polite, I would elaborately wrap their purchases; if they were rude, I would conveniently forget to tell them that we offered free gift-wrapping. One time, a woman came to the counter half-crying. She had two young children pulling at her trousers and she asked for a novel recommendation. My colleague and I looked at each other: we knew what to do. My colleague got out some stickers and entertained the kids, while I pranced around the bookstore collecting all the funniest novels I knew. I will never forget that woman’s look of relief while I talked her through the plots and she had a moment to think about what she wanted. Working retail can be like psychology: you find out what people need by reading between the lines. My colleagues and I became like a hive-mind. We knew each other’s areas of speciality in terms of book recommendations. Whenever anyone asked for a sci-fi rec, I’d direct them to Darcy. You want self-improvement lit? Best chat to Tahlia. We also knew what was going on in each other’s personal lives and so we’d toggle tasks depending on everyone’s emotional and physical capacity that day. Carolina’s been ill, so how about she plastic-wraps art books out back where there’s a chair? Leona’s hungover: it’s shelving for now. I know that, hypothetically, mutual care can exist in any work environment, but I’ve never experienced it as much as I have on the shop floor. It was this solidarity that enabled my colleagues and me to step up and take action when we realised that some of us were being unfairly remunerated and that management was withholding shifts based on arbitrary favouritisms. We had an official store group chat overseen by management and we had another unofficial group chat consisting of only floor-workers: this one was for telling truths. We also invited ex-booksellers to join our discussions and from them we realised that management had been playing the same dirty tricks for some time.   We also invited ex-booksellers to join our discussions and realised management had been playing some dirty tricks   Retail work is often conceptualised as temporary employment – it’s imagined to be what you do before you get a “real job”. This attitude means that commonly, mistreated casual retail workers will simply quit a bad workplace instead of endeavouring to fix it. This is understandable – the emotional toil and economic precarity one faces when one unionises as a casual worker is intense. But my colleagues and I were angry and determined: we decided that this fight was worth it. Over beers and in whispered conversations at the counter, we decided to organise. We knew that our labour was powerful and without it the shop couldn’t function. With the help of the Retail and Fast Food Worker’s Union, we unionised the damn shop. Over a year and a half, we stood strong against worker lock-outs and the concerted hiring of scabs. Management would declare union members’ positions “redundant” and then hire non-union members to do the exact same work. Often, after talking with these new recruits and explaining our plight, they would see the light and join the union. On a few occasions, however, this did not happen, and for me, this was the part of the struggle that hurt the most. To see young people so brainwashed by some misguided notion of capitalist loyalty that they would undermine the efforts of their colleagues to build a fairer workplace for all – this stung. But we did not give in. What we were doing was historic – we were the first retail workers in Australia (apart from meat workers) to undertake industrial action in 50 years. After a long battle, we won an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement – a document that, among other things, ensured job security for casual workers after a designated length of employment, refused junior wages and guaranteed a dollar more an hour than minimum wage. These might sound like small wins, but they were nothing short of groundbreaking. Since our industrial action, workers at two of Australia’s leading supermarket groups have followed suit. There is power in service, but there is also power in knowing your worth and knowing that how your worth is recognised is connected to how the worth of others is recognised. “We are all in this for everybody else,” became our catchphrase. As of 2021 in Australia, only 12.5% of employees are members of trade unions. In the UK, as of 2022, it’s 22.3%. This figure is better, but it’s still pretty dire. I’m not a UK union specialist, but I can say that in Australia, at least, there is a general pessimism about the utility of unions. They’ve been hit by smear campaigns. They’re also associated, in the popular imagination, with a kind of aged macho masculinity that is unappealing to younger workers and women. This was not my experience of union work. In fact, one of the coolest parts of unionising was getting to know union members in other sectors. Our lives were totally different, but our values were the same. Some of our strongest allies were members of the maritime workers’ union and the construction workers’ union. They came to our rallies and we attended theirs. We were a bunch of nerdy queers screaming for dock workers’ rights. They were some of the most staunch-looking blokes I’ve ever met and they were demanding better pay for a bunch of queer twentysomething booksellers. It was iconic.   Our lives were totally different, but our values were the same   Doing this work and forming these bonds was emboldening. I saw my youngest colleague, Carolina, grow from girlhood into the most principled, confident young woman. She’s now the union rep for the store. My colleague Darcy is now doing an economics thesis about unions in Australia. My colleague Jimmy, who is also doing a PhD, suggested we write an academic paper about our union work, so that there was a record of our action for future generations: we called the paper Making Unions Hot Again and presented it at a cultural studies conference in Perth. And yes – it was very hot. Now, instead of sitting at my desk when I returned home depleted and sad about the state of the world, I felt powerful and I felt hopeful. The sense of impotence the pandemic had cultivated in me was dissipating. Alongside my PhD, I’d also been writing a novel about a doomed love affair. As I wrote, I realised more and more that this novel was also a love letter to workers and to the bonds of friendship and mutual care that can grow even in the most dire of work environments. I have worked retail jobs for many years and I think it’s likely that I will again. In an ideal world, artists would be fairly remunerated for their work and this hustle culture we currently inhabit would not be necessary. But the world is as it is – artists and writers are generally not paid what they deserve. And though it is not always the case, a shop can be a castle for an artist, or for anyone. A shop is a place where workers can love each other, create a community and give to it. It’s a place where mundane tasks can metamorphose into a sense of purpose. Every shop worker is making something. To write, you have to know the world. Working in shops has taught me more about human nature than pretty much anything else. I think that care is paying attention, and shop work taught me that alongside habit forms care. I care about the world and the people in it much more after working in shops. The terrible truth is – I care a lot. Green Dot by Madeleine Gray is published by Orion at £18.99. Buy it for £16.71 at guardianbookshop.com"

        "content": "Water companies are preparing to announce a significant increase in bills for customers, despite a torrent of criticism of their environmental records. The 11 water suppliers in England and Wales have until the end of January to publish their new household charges, which will take effect from April. In early February, the industry body, Water UK, will then announce how much bills have increased by on average. Last year they went up by £31 to £448. The announcement is likely to open the floodgates for a fresh round of criticism of an industry facing anger over sewage dumping, executive pay, debt levels and big dividends. The companies have a tightrope to walk. On one hand, they will consider how much more their customers can afford to pay and whether their already damaged reputation can withstand a backlash over bills. On the other, they need to spend large amounts on infrastructure to fix the country’s leaky pipes and bolster water resources to cope with the climate crisis. Meanwhile, a £10bn promise to improve infrastructure to tackle pollution – ultimately paid for by bill payers – has been delayed. “There is an element of catchup here,” says Martin Young, an analyst at Investec. “The challenges for the water sector are clear for all. In the past, the level of the bill has been very high up the priority scale; as a consequence, some of the investment we would have liked to have seen as a country hasn’t been made.” The exact rise in charges is determined by several factors. A significant driver is last November’s CPIH inflation figure (the consumer price index including owner-occupiers’ housing costs), used across the industry to calculate annual bills, which came in at 4.2%.   Water companies should be showing greater generosity and putting their hand in their own pocket  Andrew White, Consumer Council for Water    On top of this, the regulator, Ofwat, allows companies to charge more if they hit targets on pollution, leaks and customer service. In September, Ofwat ordered 12 underperforming companies to take £114m off bills from April, including £101m from debt-laden Thames Water. By contrast, Severn Trent was allowed to add £88m. Industry sources believe nearly all suppliers plan to increase bills, most by November’s inflation figure or more. The north Wales water company Hafren Dyfrdwy is expected to make the largest increase, while Welsh Water could be the only supplier to reduce bills, as a result of penalties for supply interruptions and leakage during the last financial year, sources said. Thames Water, Britain’s biggest supplier, could increase at below the inflation rate, but its consumption figures were hard to assess due to problems with its stuttering smart meter rollout, a source said. Limits on the amount companies can charge were set in 2019, as part of the twice-a-decade price review. Ofwat’s allowances were later made more generous after a challenge by some companies through the Competition and Markets Authority. The charges announced this month will apply to the final year of the current price period, and the regulator is now studying business plans which will cover 2025 to 2030 and detail further planned increases in bills. “People get that there is a need for investment and that needs to be remunerated. But they want it to be fair and for water companies to deliver – there is no hiding place for them,” says Young. Meanwhile, concerns are mounting over the ability of low-income households to pay bills. Plans for a standardised social water tariff were considered but later abandoned by the government. Just over 1.3 million low-income households are on a piecemeal assortment of cut-price tariffs, largely funded by other customers. The Consumer Council for Water (CCW) has called on the entire industry to join the five companies that contribute some profits to social tariff support. “Water companies should be showing greater generosity and putting their hand in their own pocket to help bolster support even further,” said Andrew White, a senior policy leader at the CCW. White cited harrowing cases such as a person who showered in their clothes to avoid using the washing machine, and those who said they were “scared” to ask for help. Water-bill arrears were often deprioritised by debt advice agencies, as indebted customers would not be cut off, White says. He is also concerned that a 2019 industry commitment to eradicate water poverty by 2030 has slipped off the agenda. “In the absence of action by the government, it’s back on companies to attempt to achieve that target.”"

        "content": "Both chancellor Jeremy Hunt and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves went to the annual Davos World Economic Forum last week proclaiming that Britain was “open to business”. These mundane statements of the obvious reminded me of the character in one of Michael Frayn’s ­novels who had an open mind – “open at the front and open at the back”. For that is what Brexit has achieved. We spent almost 45 years opening our markets to what is now known as the European Union, adding the considerable benefit of membership of the single market – not least thanks to Margaret Thatcher and Jacques Delors. From the abandonment of monetarism onwards, the emphasis of British economic policy was on attracting overseas investment. But in one fell swoop – thanks to a wholly unnecessary referendum, founded, alas, on ignorance, prejudice and lies – the Cameron government opened the back door. The single market was designed, from the UK’s point of view, to boost trade with and investment from the EU, but the exit was opened and Britain has suffered. We are now experiencing the consequence of the bad influence that Thatcherite political economy had on our polity, and the rejection of the good. That is to say: so many of the ills that now so manifestly beset the nation result from the Thatcherite obsession with “­rolling back the frontiers of the state”, while the economic performance of that same state is now impeded by the rejection of her greatest beneficial contribution to the country – namely membership of the single market.   While not exactly a ‘failed state’ in the sense of many countries one could name, the UK is certainly an ailing one   Rolling back the frontiers of the state has affected the performance of so many of the public utilities whose reliable services we took for granted: everything from the NHS to education to the Post Office and the water and sewage system – let alone the rail network, which even Thatcher did not dare to privatise. While not exactly a “failed state” in the sense of many countries one could name, the UK is certainly an ailing one, in which too many people are understandably inclined to say “nothing works properly”. As one eminent historian said to me recently, “the people who gave us Brexit argued that it would reverse our economic decline. Instead it has accelerated that decline”. Every day now, the evidence of the damage and interference to our daily lives wreaked by Brexit takes its toll: the extra bureaucratic burden of further customs checks is due in April, and border checks are being imposed later this year on the freedom of movement in the rest of Europe that we had previously taken for granted. Meanwhile, we learn from the British Chambers of Commerce that 60% of firms are finding it more difficult to trade with the EU than was the case a year earlier, and the mayor of London has pointed out that Brexit is taking its toll on the metropolis, notwithstanding the fact that London is generally considered one of the most attractive tourist locations. Sadiq Khan is not afraid to defy the omertà that has been imposed by the Labour leadership on the subject of the single market. Yet at a time when surveys indicate that no more than a fifth of leavers regard Brexit as a success, and most people recognise it as a disaster, Labour refuses to acknowledge in public that the “red wall” Brexit emperor has no clothes. As I have written before, I am not confident that a Labour leadership that is frightened of saying boo to a goose will win the next election. But it seems blazingly obvious that the fissiparous Conservative party is doing its best to lose it – probably with a little help from the ghastly Nigel Farage and the so called Reform party. Labour is indulging in all manner of preparations for government – while certainly not being overconfident. All this talk of the need for investment-led growth, and the importance of private-sector investment as well as public, is worthy and sensible, but it lacks the confidence-building assurance of a public – indeed, electoral – commitment to rejoin the single market. Some of my contacts in the foreign exchange market tell me they believe such a commitment would have a beneficent impact on the pound – and hence on inflation – as well as on the prospect of attracting that inward investment that would make a reality of being “open to business”. Having made his pro-business pitch in Davos, the chancellor announced his intention to concentrate on tax cuts in his next budget (or two). This is rationalised by the claim that low-tax economies favour stronger growth; the real reason is a desperate attempt to bribe the electorate. The unstated corollary is that, with more public sector austerity already in the pipeline, our public services will continue to suffer."

        "content": "Will 2024 be a boom or a bust for big tech? By one estimate, there have been more than 7,500 layoffs in the sector since the start of the year – a dispersal of pink slips that many hoped would have ceased after the deep job cuts of 2023. However, as the US’s big tech earnings season gets under way this week, some analysts are predicting strong numbers. This batch of quarterly financial results may show that the industry has cleared out its pandemic-era overhiring and reorganised itself around cloud computing and AI - necessitating cuts in sectors with less rosy prospects. Analysts keen on AI say we are at the start of a tech bull market.   Related: Google boss warns staff to expect further job cuts this year   Since the start of the year, Google has laid off more than a thousand employees across hardware, ad sales, search, shopping, maps, policy, core engineering, Google Assistant and YouTube. The cuts are slight compared to last January, when the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, announced a 12,000-worker layoff, but Pichai has warned of more cuts to come. In an internal memo last week, he told employees that Alphabet was “removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas”. “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” Pichai said in the memo, obtained by the Verge. “The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.” But the cuts, he added, would not be “at the scale of last year’s reductions, and will not touch every team”. The Alphabet Workers Union called the layoffs “needless” in a Wednesday post on X (formerly Twitter). Amazon has also announced a fresh round of job cuts affecting hundreds of employees from its Prime Video and Amazon MGM studios divisions - part of a pullback from an overspend on entertainment and a refocus on core priorities such as online shopping logistics and new ones such as AI. At Meta, where more than 20,000 jobs were cut last year, the excision of departments appears to have slowed but not stopped. Instagram eliminated a layer of management in mid-January, cutting 60 technical program managers. Last year it said it would add workers to support “priority areas” and shift the workforce composition to include more “higher-cost technical roles”. And that may be the true story of tech in 2024. If Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is correct, job cuts are mostly done, and earnings season is going to be an occasion to “break out the popcorn”. “The AI revolution is going to have beneficiaries but also companies that are on the wrong side of it, so they’ve got to cut costs in areas that are not producing revenue and double down on AI,” he says. “It’s more of a reallocation than anything else, because 95% of the cost-cutting is in the rear-view mirror. But the strong are going to get stronger and the weaker hands are going to be exposed.” But which hands are those? Apple may be banking on the Vision Pro headset, which goes on sale this month, and on new iPhone models with generative AI features, to boost lagging sales. A weak Chinese economy has forced the company to discount the prices of many of its smartphones and hope for a turnaround. Last week, Bank of America securities analyst Wamsi Mohan offered an optimistic reading of Apple’s year, floating the potential for a “stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle” that could come about in “anticipation of AI features”. According to Ives, an increase in demand for enterprise software and cybersecurity, and a surge in demand around major AI projects, will be the key story for the earnings season, and will continue to be as the AI revolution gathers momentum. The winners are already emerging. Last week, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the most valuable company globally for the first time since 2021, with a market capitalisation of close to $3tn. Last year, Microsoft cut 16,000 from its 232,000 headcount, and Wedbush recently estimated that Microsoft’s lead in AI could add $25bn to the company’s revenues by 2025. “The shift to cloud and AI is having a massive effect on tech, including the reallocation of jobs and a lot of changes to Apple and Google,” says Ives. “AI monetisation is going to start with Nvidia and Microsoft, and we believe we’re seeing the beginning of a new tech bull market that began in the summer of 2023.”"

        "content": "I spent most of 2017 making sure some of the largest banks and corporations in the world would never facilitate tax evasion, even accidentally.   Related: HMRC has not charged a single company over tax evasion under landmark legislation   These businesses spent a fortune drilling down to every level of their business, finding and closing down any way in which a rogue employee, junior or senior, could help a client or business counter-party evade tax, anywhere in the world. What created such an outbreak of public-spiritedness? The Criminal Finances Act 2017 – an unsung triumph of the Cameron and May governments. The act created a new corporate criminal offence for any company if any of its employees facilitated tax evasion. It didn’t matter whether the directors were involved in the tax evasion, or even knew about it – the company would automatically be guilty. It could be UK tax that was evaded, or tax anywhere in the world. And foreign businesses, too, fell within its scope if they had even the slightest UK presence. Nobody could ignore it. If a corporation was successfully prosecuted for tax evasion, that would amount to a corporate death sentence: banks could lose their banking licence, corporations would lose their government contracts, mining companies could lose their concessions. There was only one defence. A company could escape criminal liability if it could demonstrate that it had put reasonable procedures in place to prevent its employees facilitating tax evasion. And this was the whole point. Nobody could ever be sure that someday, somewhere, a rogue employee wouldn’t facilitate tax evasion for somebody. So they had to work really hard to create “reasonable procedures”. That’s why they hired me. The Criminal Finances Act (CFA) was a brilliant concept. And everyone assumed it would catch on – that the rest of Europe, and then maybe the rest of the world, would enact similar rules. Every corporation worldwide would be turned into a giant unpaid tax policeman. It had the potential to radically reduce the scope for bad actors to exploit legitimate businesses. A compelling answer to the accusation that the City of London was the “dirty money capital of the world”. The CFA followed the successful model of the Bribery Act. That also created an automatic criminal offence for corporations, with one single defence that incentivised them to get their house in order. And people take the Bribery Act very seriously indeed – all the more so after Airbus had to pay £830m in the UK to settle a bribery prosecution in 2020, and Entain had to pay a £615m penalty last year. People took the CFA equally seriously at first. We all awaited the first prosecutions: in 2019 HMRC announced it had nine live investigations, then 13 in 2020. But nothing happened. Each year, more investigations were announced; each year, no prosecutions. And so, bit by bit, the CFA has ceased to become scary. It is now 2024 and there have still been no prosecutions. Those clients who paid for exhaustive work across their global business probably feel like chumps. Some of their rivals, who winged it, probably feel vindicated. Even the best anti-tax evasion processes need regular updating – but who’s going to spend serious money updating their 2017 work now? So that valuable protection against tax evasion is, year by year, becoming less valuable. Certainly all that talk about other countries following the UK’s lead has melted away. It’s possible that the reason no company has been prosecuted under the CFA is that not a single UK company has facilitated tax evasion since 2017. That, however, doesn’t feel terribly likely. The more plausible reason is that when evidence has come to light of tax evasion being facilitated, HMRC has quietly assessed penalties behind the scenes, and the matter has been resolved quietly. This likely makes sense from a raw economic perspective. HMRC gets to collect tax without the time, expense and risk of a prosecution. But in the long term it’s a serious mistake. It neuters what was once a powerful tool. A law that’s not publicly enforced may as well not exist. Only saints will comply with it. The rest – the people we really want to comply with it – won’t bother. If we want to drive tax evasion out of the corporate world, we don’t need new rules – we just need to enforce the ones we have.

        "content": "A group of charities are to take over part of Fenwick’s former Bond Street department store next month, bringing secondhand clothing to one of London’s most exclusive shopping locations. From 9 February, the Charity Super.Mkt group, which involves five charities including Shelter, Traid, Shaw Trust and Havens Hospices, will temporarily inhabit the former handbag and accessories section. Fenwick is moving out of the site after almost 133 years. Described as the “pre-loved” department store, the multi-charity shop will be open for a fortnight. It will also host events with DJs at weekends as it trades alongside the stores of luxury brands including Dior, Hermès and Emporio Armani The charities will use fittings and even hangers from Fenwick as well as some items donated by the designer brands that will be finishing their packing up behind hoardings in the rest of the store. The department store chain, which was founded in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1882 by John James Fenwick, announced in 2022 it was selling the site on New Bond Street to invest in its seven other locations, which include Newcastle, Kingston in south London and York, as well as updating its online presence. The new owner, which bought the building for a reported £420m, is to convert it into a mixed-use development with retail on the ground floor and offices above. Charity Super.Mkt started with a six-week residency in a former Topshop in London’s Brent Cross shopping centre and the Fenwick project will be its 15th popup. It is occupying sites in Bristol, Edinburgh, Oxford, Salford and London’s Westfield centre in west London, tapping into the trend for vintage fashion. The initiative has so far raised almost £1.6m for charities through the sale of more than 180,000 items, diverting 53 tonnes of clothing away from landfill. Wayne Hemingway, the former Red or Dead designer who has helped bring the project together, said: “We are on a mission to get charity fashion into spaces and places it hasn’t been before. Bond Street with all the big brands and dresses for £2,000 is going to be a major experiment. Will people come who have a very different background to most charity shoppers and who maybe have never been in a charity shop before?” While the project’s organisers are not promising vintage designer bargains. Hemingway said the charities would be “putting stuff aside” that they thought was right for Bond Street. “There won’t be the same stock as on Scunthorpe High Street, it will be tailored as best we can,” he added. Maria Chenoweth, the chief executive of Traid, who co-founded the project, said the venture had “lots of offers on the table” for future sites but was keen to secure a good spot on London’s Oxford Street where it could fill one of the multitude of empty stores. She said she hoped the Bond Street popup would be “a launch pad for something special”. Chenoweth added that Charity Super.Mkt had been offered a spot as part of a project to put independents into vacant units on Oxford Street but had been told it would be up to two years before it could move in. Its organisers hope change the perception of charity shopping as the rise of online marketplaces such as Depop and Vinted inspires young people to look beyond fast fashion. Long term, the former Fenwick site’s new owner, Lazari Investments, which is run by the descendants of the late property tycoon Chris Lazari, have said the five-storey building will become offices and retail space. Leo Fenwick, a member of the department store’s founding family who is director of strategic partnerships, said: “Partnering with Charity Super.Mkt combines many threads of our sustainability and charitable initiatives, including helping accelerate the move to a low-waste society with the reduction in textile waste, supporting opportunities for women to thrive, and partnering with charities to improve communities and the environment.” Interest in more sustainable ways of dressing and the rising cost of living have fuelled a boom in trade for charities and online sellers. Sales of secondhand clothing were up almost 50% to £1.27bn in 2022, according to a report from the Co-operative Bank and Ethical Consumer magazine, while charity shop sales were up 147%. The UK market is forecast to rise by 67.5% from 2022 to 2026, with menswear the fastest-growing sector, according to analysts at the analytics and consultancy firm GlobalData."

        "content": "The S&P 500 scaled a new all-time high on Friday amid signs that the economic despondency that has gripped US consumers may be easing. The index climbed 1.2% to 4,838 on Friday afternoon, clearing a record last set two years ago. It has rallied more than 17% since late October. Earlier in the day, an influential survey showed that consumer sentiment soared 13% in January to reach its highest level since July 2021. The University of Michigan’s monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, the biggest monthly advance since 2005 and far exceeding expectations.   Related: Half of recent US inflation due to high corporate profits, report finds   The news came after a similarly sharp rise in December. Joanne Hsu, University of Michigan’s director of surveys, said that over the last two months, sentiment has climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession ended. “Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,” said Hsu. The rise was driven in large part by expectations that the rate of inflation will continue to decline. The survey found that consumers expect prices to climb at an annual rate of 2.9% over the next year, down from the 3.1% reported in December. Expectations about price rises over the next five to 10 years hit a four-month low of 2.8%. Consumers have consistently reported feeling gloomy about the economy since the end of the pandemic. Those reports have come even as unemployment hovers close to a 50-year low, stock markets have soared and the wider economy has remained resilient. The disconnect has puzzled economists and presented the Biden administration with a major dilemma ahead of the 2024 election. Joe Biden has made “Bidenomics” – his economic recovery program – a central plank of his re-election campaign. But surveys show it has so far met with little enthusiasm from voters. Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House council of economic advisers, hailed the survey as proof that Biden’s policies are working. “We have more work to do, but we’re on the right path as we execute President Biden’s agenda, and people are starting to feel it,” Bernstein said. “That’s a sharp contrast with congressional Republicans’ plans to cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations while raising healthcare and prescription drug costs for hard-working American families.” The Michigan survey is the latest in a series that indicate the national mood may be changing. A survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released earlier this month found consumers expected inflation to ease over the short, medium and long term and expectations about credit access and households’ financial situation were less pessimistic. In December the Conference Board reported 2023 had ended with a surge in consumer confidence. The research group’s closely watched consumer confidence survey rose to levels last seen in July."

        "content": "It’s crunch time for Walkers after a ruling that the company must pay VAT on its mini poppadoms because they are really more like crisps. The manufacturer had argued that the sales tax should not apply to its bags of Sensations Poppadoms as they were not crisps – which are on a special list of snack foods subject to the levy alongside ice-cream, chocolate-covered biscuits and cereal bars. Under the complex tax rules, foods on that list attract 20% VAT, which can mean a multimillion-pound bill for sellers. Traditional poppadoms are zero-rated as they are deemed to be a restaurant food or one that requires further preparation rather than a packaged snack. Previous VAT debates have involved McVitie’s Jaffa Cakes, which tax authorities in the 1990s unsuccessfully argued were biscuits; Pringles, a win for HM Revenue and Customs when they were found to be a crisp; and flapjacks, which were found to be too chewy to be a cake and therefore subject to VAT. In 2008, Marks & Spencer claimed back £3.5m in overpaid VAT on its chocolate teacakes after a 12-year battle that ended in Europe’s highest court ruling they were cakes and not a biscuit. Walkers argued its mini poppadoms should not be classed as a crisp as they were not made from potato and required preparation before consumption, as they were designed for dipping in sauces or to have alongside a curry. However, a tax tribunal found that the “small, generally round, bite-sized objects”, which were “somewhat wavy, with small bubbles on the surface”, were crisps in all but name as 40% of the ingredients were “potato-derived” including potato granules and potato starch. The ruling said this was “more than enough potato content for it to be reasonable to conclude” that the products fell within the tax rule that stipulate a crisp was “made from the potato … or from potato starch”. The tribunal judges, Anne Fairpo and Sonia Gable, added: “Nominative determinism is not a characteristic of snack foods: calling a snack food Hula Hoops does not mean that one could twirl that product around one’s midriff, nor is Monster Munch generally reserved as a food for monsters.” They were also unconvinced by the suggestion that Sensations Poppadoms were used in the same way as their larger brethren. “In practice, we did not consider that they were significantly different to potato crisps with regard to their ability to convey dips etc, particularly given that we consider that there is a practical limit to the amount of dip or chutney that most people are likely to want to combine with the crunch of the conveyor product. “They are packaged and sold in a manner similar to potato crisps. Removing them from their packaging, we consider that their appearance and texture is similar to potato crisps.” It said that the flavours – Lime & Coriander Chutney and Mango & Red Chilli Chutney – were “not a distinguishing factor”. Walkers had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication. However, the company does have the right to appeal against the tribunal decision."

        "content": "The owner of Port Talbot steelworks has confirmed that its two blast furnaces will shut down, in what unions have condemned as an “absolutely devastating” blow that will cost up to 2,800 jobs directly and many more in the south Wales community. Port Talbot’s parent company, the Indian-owned Tata Steel, said it was not “feasible or affordable” to adopt trade union proposals to continue production at the loss-making plant during a transition to greener, cheaper steelmaking operations. Amid fury and despair in the Welsh town, Tata could now face strikes at the plant, according to Unite, one of three unions representing steelworkers, which said it was considering industrial action.  On Friday, after trading on the stock exchange ended in Mumbai, Tata officially confirmed its plans, which will result in most of the plant’s 4,000 workers losing their jobs. Of the positions slated for redundancy, 2,500 are expected to go within 18 months. About 200 positions will be saved by maintaining operations at the site’s hot strip mill, which rolls steel slab, while some temporary jobs will be created in the construction of new electric arc furnaces (EAFs). The cuts come despite the government providing £500m of financial backing for Tata’s £1.25bn four-year plan to build EAFs to produce steel from scrap metal, rather than virgin steel which is made from scratch. Keir Starmer urged the government to look again at the union’s proposals to avoid compulsory redundancies, which the Labour leader said were “viable” despite an estimated extra cost of £683m. “This government plan could lead to the end of steel in the United Kingdom,” he said. Labour has said it would invest £3bn in the transition to green steel. Rishi Sunaksaid the government’s smaller investment showed it was “absolutely committed” to British steelmaking. However, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he had written to Sunak asking for urgent talks about the furnace closures but had been told the prime minister was “not available”. The blast furnace closures, together with similar proposals at the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, would leave the UK as the only G20 economy without the ability to make steel from scratch. Instead, the UK will produce recycled product, using the surplus of scrap steel that is currently exported. Tata, which says the plant is losing £1m a day, said it would seek voluntary redundancies where possible and would provide £130m to fund severance payments, community programmes, skills training and job-seeking initiatives. The company rejected a proposal put forward by the Community and GMB unions that would have kept the blast furnaces open, protecting jobs during the transition. The two unions said that governments in France, Germany and Spain were all “committing billions to secure the future of their strategically important steel industries, and our government must show similar ambition”. They added: “More than 3,000 jobs and the future of British steelmaking are at stake. It is an absolute disgrace that Tata Steel, and the UK government, appear intent on pursuing the cheapest instead of the best plan for our industry, our steelworkers and our country. “It’s unbelievable any government would give a company £500m to throw 3,000 workers on the scrapheap, and our government must re-evaluate its miserly offer to support investment at Tata Steel.” Community said the closure was “absolutely devastating” to the local economy and called Tata’s plan “decarbonisation on the cheap”. Amid a schism between trade unions representing steelworkers, the GMB and Community also lashed out at Unite, which had put forward a separate £12bn plan to revive UK steelmaking over 12 years that they described as “discredited fantasy”. The Unite Wales secretary, Peter Hughes, said: “Our members are angry and frustrated and will do everything in their power to preserve steelmaking at Port Talbot including taking industrial action.” Sunak, asked about the Port Talbot announcement, said the government was “absolutely committed” to British steelmaking. TV Narendran, Tata Steel’s global chief executive and managing director, said: “The course we are putting forward is difficult, but we believe it is the right one. Having invested almost £5bn in the UK business since 2007, we must transform at pace to build a sustainable business in the UK for the long term. “Our ambitious plan includes the largest capital expenditure in UK steel production in more than a decade, guaranteeing long-term, high-quality steel production in the UK and transforming the Port Talbot facility into one of Europe’s premier centres for green steelmaking.” Tata estimates that converting Port Talbot to EAFs will reduce the UK’s carbon emissions by about 1.5%. The technology also requires far fewer workers than blast furnaces, meaning the plant is unlikely to increase staffing levels after the transition. The company has indicated that the plant could not have continued to operate without the transition, which would ultimately have threatened its entire UK operation, employing 8,000 people, which relies on supplies from Port Talbot. In theory, Tata Steel and the government could invest in direct reduced iron (DRI) steelmaking, as other countries in Europe have done, to produce iron for the steelmaking process. The technology uses gas at present but can be converted to run on zero-carbon hydrogen. "

Tata said said it considered independent studies in whether it could keep blast furnaces running while it built new furnaces, but determined it was too expensive not “not feasible”, due to the “deteriorating” performance of some Port Talbot assets. Instead it has pledged a “comprehensive support package” worth £130m for workers impacted by its he transition to an electric arc furnace – meant to recycle scrap, rather than create virgin steel – there are growing concerns about the ripple effects of the job cuts.  However, Andrew Gutteridge, chairman of the Multi Unions Llanwern works, told the PA news agency that Tata Steel’s confirmation that the decision was “absolutely devastating”, while Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s Minister for Economy, called it a “social and economic body-blow”.

More from our reporters:    Related: Port Talbot steelworks: blast furnaces to close, costing up to 2,800 jobs     Related: ‘It’s a betrayal’: Port Talbot anger over Tata Steel’s decision to close furnaces     Related: Tata’s Port Talbot decision goes beyond Wales and even steel | Nils Pratley   We’ll be back on Monday.      4.03pm GMT   The crisis in the steel industry has been 40 years in the making, people were saying almost a decade ago during one of Tata Steel’s earlier panics about its losses in the UK.  And it’s true that the forces of globalisation, Chinese dumping of steel on world markets, weak tariffs and punitively high energy costs in the UK are not new. On top, one can add the fresh imperative to decarbonise a polluting industry. But the Indian-owned company’s decision to close its two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales contains a genuinely new feature. For the first time since the creation of the industry, the UK will be left without capacity to make steel from scratch. The replacement electric arc furnace (EAF) on the site, due to open in 2027 with the help of a £500m government grant, will be fed by recycled scrap. The only other blast furnaces, under Chinese ownership in Scunthorpe, are already due to close and be replaced by EAFs too. The newer technology is cleaner, more efficient and requires substantially fewer workers. But, quite aside from the damage to the town of Port Talbot from the loss of up to 2,800 jobs, there is an enormous question of industrial strategy here.  Can Tata’s new EAF, assuming it is built, really be a like-for-like replacement for the blast furnaces that will be lost? If not, is it sensible for the UK to leave itself without the capacity to make virgin steel? No other G20 country has taken that radical step. Fans of EAFs argue the range of steel products that can be produced is wide and securing top grades is really a question of getting good-quality scrap; and, since the UK exports more scrap metal than it uses, supply should not be an insurmountable problem.  Sceptics regard that description as too breezy: the output from EAFs is problematic for the automotive industry, introduces hidden costs and relies on a supply chain that may not be secure. A resilient steel industry, goes the argument, cannot bet the house on EAFs: it has to have the ability to produce virgin product. Who’s right? Well, the point is surely that the government hasn’t seriously addressed the question.

Steel output from Port Talbot in South Wales was once the envy of the industrialised world, with workers at the Margam site breaking records for production, according to a story in the business pages of the Guardian in 1956.  It reported that the Steel Company of Wales had, in one week, produced 37 tonnes. If it had continued at that rate, it would have made over 18 million tonnes of steel in a year – the current site was said to be capable of producing only 5 million tonnes of steel per annum. In 1967, The Steel Company of Wales was nationalised and absorbed into British Steel Corporation. Here’s the article (which was accompanied by the latest prices from the Oldham Stock Exchange…)     2.59pm GMT   Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is urging the government to take another look at the plan proposed by steel unions that would have saved thousands of jobs (see earlier post for details). Starmer said he was “very concerned” after Tata Steel confirmed plans to close blast furnaces at its plant in Port Talbot, South Wales. He told broadcasters:   “I was there just in October so I know how this is going to impact on the workforce. The Government said it had a plan for steel. It transpires the plan involves thousands of redundancies. There’s a better plan, a multi-union plan, that the Government needs to look at again. “That’s a viable way forward. It’s vital we have a viable steel industry in the United Kingdom. Labour has got a plan for that viable future, not just for the next year or two but for decades to come.”      2.42pm GMT   Here’s local MP Stephen Kinnock:  Important discussion earlier with @Jacqui_Smith1 & @IainDale on @GMB on the growing global demand for green steel - and the compelling multi-union plan we need to deliver a bridge to the green economy, not a cliff edge.The Tories are paying Tata £500m for 3,000 job losses. pic.twitter.com/wM6GKsR37V— Stephen Kinnock (@SKinnock) January 19, 2024  Kinnock also told Sky News that the move by Tata was “deeply disappointing’, adding:  “We’ve got a plan that’s been cobbled together between Tata Steel and the UK government which is going to use £500 million of taxpayers money to make 3,000 men and women redundant [It] is also going to remove the British capability to make its own steel from scratch.

We will continue our work with the UK and Welsh governments, trade unions and the community to help those who may be affected through the proposed transition.”   Updated at 2.47pm GMT    2.20pm GMT   Andrew Gutteridge, chairman of the Multi Unions Llanwern works, has told the PA news agency that Tata Steel’s confirmation that it would close blast furnaces at its plant in Port Talbot was “absolutely devastating”. Mr Gutteridge said:   “Absolutely devastating. Absolutely heartbreaking for the local economy, the local communities and the whole of the UK steel industry. “If we don’t fight this and get it right, there is no future for the UK steel industry.”  Gutteridge added that the impact on Port Talbot will be severe:   “It will absolute ruin the community. Your local newsagents, your chip shops, your supermarkets – everything in this area will be affected. “And not just here in this area, in Bridgend, Neath, up in the Valleys which are already decimated from the mines years ago. This is a massive, massive kick for the whole of South Wales really.”      2.09pm GMT  Friends of the Earth: huge blow to workers and the local community  Tata Steel’s decision to close down its coal-fired blast furnaces is a “huge blow” to workers and the local community, says Tony Bosworth, Friends of the Earth energy campaigner, adding:  The world is moving towards green steel production, but the UK government’s lack of a forward-thinking Industrial Strategy has left workers high and dry. “Port Talbot should be at the forefront of a transition to clean steel – with investment in green hydrogen to power virgin steel manufacturing, as well as electric arc furnaces. This would help protect jobs, support homegrown steel production, and boost the UK’s switch to a green economy.  Bosworth adds that it shows the “folly” of the government’s decision to approve a new coal mine in Cumbria a year ago – partly to provide coal for UK steel.  “Ministers must end their support for this polluting and unnecessary coal mine - and put areas like West Cumbria and Port Talbot at the heart of the cleaner future we urgently need.”      2.01pm GMT   The job losses at Port Talbot have also opened up a split between UK unions, who had proposed two different plans to prevent heavy cuts. My colleague Rob Davies writes:  Amid a schism between trade unions representing steelworkers, the GMB and Community lashed out at Unite, which had put forward a separate £12bn plan to revive UK steelmaking over 12 years that they described as “discredited fantasy”.      1.59pm GMT    Government briefing that Port Talbot blast furnaces are coming to the end of their useful life and need to be replaced is...well, you don't really need to write the punchline to that one.— Rob Davies (@ByRobDavies) January 19, 2024      1.38pm GMT   The job losses at Tata show why it’s “absolutely vital” for the government to play a stronger role in securing a green and fair transition, says Greenpeace UK’s policy director Dr Doug Parr. Parr adds:  Clean steel production is the future of this industry, and many countries around the world are already shifting to green steel made with hydrogen technology. Alongside the new electric arc furnaces, this is an option that could have saved jobs at Port Talbot and helped revitalise this industry but it’s now a missed opportunity. The global race to a low-carbon economy is on, and if the UK doesn’t seize its chance to create those jobs here, they’ll simply go somewhere else. We believe a better future for the workers, the economy and the planet is possible - but both government and businesses need to get serious about it.”      12.38pm GMT   Tata Steel’s announcement is a “social and economic body-blow”, says Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s Minister for Economy Gething explains:  In choosing not to pursue a modern industrial strategy with steel at its core, the UK Government has damaged our ability to create the long term, reliable growth that would turn net zero measures into more sustainable, green jobs in Wales. We have repeatedly urged the UK Government to act at scale with the investment needed to support the move to greener methods of steel production and for the Company to lead on a fair and just transition for its workers and those UK companies within its extensive supply chain. Today’s announcement presents a social and economic body-blow with profound and far-reaching implications for Wales. It is our firm view that the Prime Minister and his cabinet do have levers at their disposal that could prevent the worst case scenario and the scale of economic loss we now face. UK Ministers must now work rapidly in the coming hours and days to convene talks that explore all avenues to bring about a longer, fairer transition that supports a larger, more secure steel industry.  Gething adds that he has raised concerns with the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Kemi Badenoch MP and Minister of State, Nusrat Ghani MP, adding:  It is a matter of deep regret that the UK Government - and in particular the Department for Business and Trade – has to date demonstrated no recognition of the strategic importance of the sector. Unlike previous Business Secretaries, the current UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade has refused to meet with Welsh Ministers at a time of unrivalled uncertainty and risk for the sector.      12.34pm GMT   Wales Online report that Wales’ First Minister, Mark Drakeford, was turned down by the prime minister when he requested “urgent discussions” on the job losses announced at Tata’s Port Talbot plant. Drakeford wrote to Rishi Sunak in the wake of a meeting between unions and steel bosses on Thursday, they say. Today, Drakeford says his administration will keep working to protect the future of Welsh steel production, and support all those affected by today’s announcement from Tata Steel.

Port Talbot’s parent company, the Indian-owned Tata Steel, said it was not “feasible or affordable” to adopt trade union proposals to continue production at the loss-making plant during a transition to greener, cheaper steelmaking operations. On Friday, after trading on the stock exchange ended in Mumbai, Tata officially confirmed its plans, which will result in most of the plant’s 4,000 workers losing their jobs. About 200 positions will be saved by maintaining operations at the site’s hot strip mill, which rolls steel slab. The cuts comes despite the government providing £500m of financial backing for Tata’s £1.25bn four-year plan to build electric arc furnaces, which make steel from scrap metal rather than virgin steel made from scratch. More here.   Related: Port Talbot steelworks: blast furnaces to close, costing up to 2,800 jobs    Updated at 1.13pm GMT    12.07pm GMT   Wales Green Party leader Anthony Slaughter has said it is “unacceptable” that the government are allowing Tata to cut so many jobs in Port Talbot, by not following the alternatives proposed by the GMB and Community unions. Slaughter says:  “This is devastating news for the local community and beyond. Wales knows only too well what happens when communities are abandoned by government and industries. We saw it with the coal industry and now it is happening again with the steel industry. “Decarbonisation of industry is vital, but communities and people’s jobs must be protected. That means putting unions and workers at the heart of a just transition. “The government has provided Tata with £500 million toward the cost of future steel production. It has a responsibility to ensure that money is used to protect Port Talbot and the wider Wales economy. “Instead, it is allowing the company to ignore viable alternatives to these job losses put forward by the unions. That is unacceptable and must be resisted.”   Updated at 12.11pm GMT    11.57am GMT  GMB & Community: extremely disappointing that plan to save jobs was rejected  The GMB and Community unions say it is “extremely disappointing” that Tata rejected its proposal to keep blast furnaces running, saving 2,300 jobs. That proposal involved keeping Port Talbot’s Blast Furnace Number 4 running until 2032, and building one smaller Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), and later probably a second EAF, rather than a single larger EAF (as Tata plans to do). In a joint statement, the unions say:  In one area the company did accept the Multi-Union recommendation, which is to keep the Hot Strip Mill open to roll slab over a transition period, supporting hundreds of jobs there, but Tata have rejected our broader proposals to safeguard production capacity and protect jobs.  Instead, more than 3,000 jobs and the future of British steelmaking is at stake, they add, urging the government to take action. They say:  It is an absolute disgrace that Tata Steel, and the UK Government, appear intent on pursuing the cheapest instead of the best plan for our industry, our steelworkers and our country. It’s unbelievable any Government would give a company £500m to throw 3,000 workers on the scrapheap, and our Government must reevaluate its miserly offer to support investment at Tata Steel. The German, French and Spanish Governments are all committing billions to secure the future of their strategically important steel industries, and our Government must show similar ambition. It is encouraging that the Labour Party have reaffirmed their commitment to the £3bn Green Steel Fund, and using it to supporting a just transition at Tata Steel UK. Tata must think again, and work with the UK Government and Labour to unlock the investment our industry needs and deserves.   Updated at 12.14pm GMT    11.47am GMT   Following Tata’s announcement, a UK government spokesperson has said there is help available for those losing their jobs in Port Talbot:  “We are determined to secure a sustainable and competitive future for the UK steel sector, which is why we have committed £500 million of UK Government support that will transform the site and protect thousands of jobs – both in Port Talbot and throughout the supply chain. “Engagement with trade unions is rightly a company-led process. “There is a broad range of support for staff affected, including a dedicated Transition Board backed by £80 million funding from UK Government and £20 million from Tata Steel. “Chaired by the Welsh Secretary with ministerial representation from the Welsh Government, the Board will support both affected employees and the local economy.”      11.45am GMT  Unite: This is industrial vandalism on a grand scale  The Unite union has pledged to use “everything in its armoury” to defend UK steel workers and the steel industry. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham condemned Tata’s plan as “industrial vandalism on a grand scale.”  “Unite is ready to use everything in its armoury to defend steel workers and our steel industry. We have detailed research demonstrating how and why Tata should be expanding UK steel production in line with growing demand, not slashing its workforce. We have secured funding from a future Labour government that could do this. Tata’s plan to close the blast furnaces is simply industrial vandalism on a grand scale.”  Graham adds that the UK government needs to defend workers and communities, as well as Britain’s industrial base and our national security, adding:  Instead, they are giving Tata hundreds of millions of pounds to fund their plan to cut jobs, cut capacity and give more business to their plants in other countries, like India and the Netherlands. How is that acceptable?”      11.41am GMT   Tata Steel says that it considered independent studies into whether it could keep the blast furnaces running while it built the new electric arc furnace – as UK unions had proposed. But, it claims, such a plan was not “not feasible”, as it would be too expensive, and not possible due to the “deteriorating” performance of some Port Talbot assets. Tata Steel says:  The projected operating costs of such a configuration are financially unaffordable Building the Electric Arc Furnace in an already operating steel melt shop would be fraught with risk, significantly increasing costs, creating a sub-optimal plant layout, delaying implementation of the plan and jeopardising the proposed business transformation programme The near end-of-life condition and deteriorating operating performance of several heavy end assets in Port Talbot      11.38am GMT   Another blow: Tata Steel expects that a further 300 roles could be impacted in three years, taking the total at risk to over 3,000. This culd include “the potential consolidation and rationalisation of cold rolling assets in Llanwern” once the required investments are completed at Port Talbot, Tata says.     11.34am GMT  Port Talbot decision: The Key Points  Here are the key points from Tata Steel’s devastating announcement that nearly 3,000 jobs are at risk through the closure of its Port Talbot blast furnaces:  The plans follow detailed discussions with the UK multi-trade union representative body (UK Steel Committee) and its advisors, in which Tata Steel carefully considered their endorsed proposal for maintaining a single blast furnace Having considered that proposal, Tata Steel has agreed to adopt elements of it, but considers that continued blast furnace production is not feasible or affordable Tata Steel will now commence statutory consultation on the proposed restructuring plan and support arrangements for affected employees Up to 2,800 employees are expected to be potentially affected, out of which around 2,500 roles would be impacted in the next 18 months The company will endeavour to maximise voluntary redundancies and proposes to commit in excess of £130 million to a comprehensive support package for affected employees, including redundancy terms, community programmes, skills training and job-seeking initiatives This is in addition to the £100 million funding for the Transition Board set up with UK and Welsh governments to support affected employees, contractors and communities Port Talbot’s two high-emission blast furnaces and coke ovens would close in a phased manner with the first blast furnace closing around mid-2024 and the remaining heavy end assets would wind down during the second half of 2024. The proposal also includes a wider restructuring of other locations and functions across the company, including the intended closure of the Continuous Annealing Processing Line (CAPL) in March 2025 In discussion with the UK Steel Committee, Tata Steel has agreed that it would continue to operate the hot strip mill through the proposed transition period and in future. In addition, the downstream and steel processing centres would continue to serve customers by utilising imported semi-finished steel from Tata Steel plants in the Netherlands and India as well as other select strategic suppliers      11.32am GMT   In a statement, Tata says:  “Tata Steel today announced it will commence statutory consultation as part of its plan to transform and restructure its UK business. “This plan is intended to reverse more than a decade of losses and transition from the legacy blast furnaces to a more sustainable, green steel business. “The transformation would secure most of Tata Steel UK’s existing product capability and maintain the country’s self-sufficiency in steelmaking, while also reducing Tata Steel UK’s CO2 emissions by five million tonnes per year and overall UK country emissions by about 1.5%.”      11.28am GMT  Tata Steel to cut up to 2,800 UK jobs in blast furnace closures  Newsflash: Tata Steel has announced that, as feared, it plans to close its two blast furnaces in at Port Talbot by the end of this year. Under Tata Steel’s proposed restructuring programme, Port Talbot’s two high-emission blast furnaces and supporting facilities would be closed in a phased manner.  The first blast furnace and coke ovens closing around mid-2024 and then progressively winding down the remaining heavy end assets during the second half of the calendar year. It would then build a new Electric Arc Furnace by 2027. The move means that up to 2,800 workers potentially losing their jobs at its steelworks plant in Wales, with around 2,500 roles impacted in the next 18 months. As flagged earlier, Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon, home of the Port Talbot steelworks, has said this would be an “utterly devastating” decision.  Updated at 11.37am GMT    11.21am GMT  Full story: Port Talbot steelworks owners expected to confirm blast furnace shutdown  The owners of the Port Talbot steelworks are expected to confirm the shutdown of its blast furnaces on Friday morning, putting almost 3,000 jobs at risk. Trade union representatives have gathered outside the gates of the works in south Wales to protest against the decision, which members have said will be a “crushing blow” to workers and UK steelmaking. The owners of Port Talbot steelworks have rejected a trade union plan designed to keep its blast furnaces running on Thursday. An announcement confirming the decision is expected before midday on Friday, after trading on the stock exchange ends in Mumbai. Shares in Port Talbot’s owner, Indian-owned Tata, rose 2% in trading, ending a two-day decline. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, said there was “still time” for Tata Steel to “pull back from the brink” of what he said would be an “utterly devastating” decision to close blast furnaces at its biggest UK plant. Speaking on Sky News on Friday morning, he said:  “Do we really want to be a country, given the dangerous and turbulent world in which we live, that isn’t able to produce its own steel?”   More here:   Related: Port Talbot steelworks owners expected to confirm blast furnace shutdown       11.15am GMT   The Port Talbot news raises questions over whether the UK have a long-term, strategic plan for industry, warned Jess Ralston, analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. Ralston said:  “These jobs did not have to be lost. A proper planned transition to the steel industry of the future, including hydrogen, could have kept these jobs in communities that need them. The rest of the world is growing their industry and keeping their jobs in steel. The UK industry will have to transition or face decline. “We’re currently falling behind Europe in the development of green steel manufacturing, as demand for the product is set to increase.

Asked whether he was happy about the prospect of job cuts, Mr Sunak told broadcasters:   “I know first of all that it will be a worrying time for everyone affected, and because it’s a commercially sensitive matter, and people appreciate there’s a limit to what I can say. “But what I can tell you is we are absolutely committed to steelmaking in the UK and that’s why the Government provided half a billion pounds to support Tata. “The alternative, by the way, was it, the entire plant, will be closed and all 8,000 jobs will be lost, but the Government worked with the company. “The company is investing more money in order to safeguard thousands of jobs, and that’s something that the UK Government has done. “The Welsh Government did not participate in that and that’s because we cared about those jobs, and the future of steelmaking in Wales and the UK, because there’s an announcement coming later, but it’s important that we wait for that.”      10.23am GMT    “We've been banging the drum for having a plan, that properly phased transition to a new future for a decade.

Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s finance minister, told delegates she discussed this issue with a very significant international business leader who’s also a big investor in Canada:  “And he said to me, all the countries in the world need to be very careful that decarbonisation does not mean deindustrialization.  I thought that was an extremely smart comment.   And Canada has absolutely determined that decarbonisation for us will mean more jobs, more growth, more manufacturing, and we recognise that government needs to play a role to make that happen.”      9.56am GMT   The feared closure of the Port Talbot blast furnaces is part of a wider “deindustrialisation of Europe”, says Dr Kirill Shakhnov, senior lecturer in economics at the University of Surrey. Dr Shakhnov explains:  “Steel production is an energy-intensive and environmentally impactful process. The cut in energy supplies to Europe from Russia has led to the deindustrialisation of Europe in general. The Russian energy supplies were redirected to India.      9.49am GMT   This is a very good point, unfortunately:  Can we stop pretending that the job losses at Port Talbot will be 3000.

Blast furnaces burn coal to melt iron ore to make iron, that then has carbon removed to produce steel. The electric arc furnace which is expected to replace them are a greener option – as they use electricity (ideally from renewable sources) to melt down scrap steel or iron. While significantly greener than coal-fired furnaces, the new process is also much less labour intensive, leading to job losses. Here’s a handy explanation:   Related: Iron resolve: steel town unites to fight for its furnaces   But Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s economy minister, is concerned that the change will leave the UK unable to make primary steel. Gething told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, that it is an “incredibly worrying day, not just for the steel workforce, but for Wales, and I think across Britain”, adding:  “There is hope that in the future electric arc furnaces can produce all grades of steel —they can’t today” “What this would mean, if this plan goes ahead, is that the UK would be the only G7 country that can’t make primary steel. “If you don’t wait for the technology to change, you will transfer your ability to do that to other parts of the world and be reliant on imports for a number of years. That is an issue not just for Wales — (it is) a strategic sovereign issue for the UK.”   Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.24am GMT  Kinnock: Blast furnace closures would be “utterly devastating” decision  Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon, home of the Port Talbot steelworks, has urged Tata Steel to “look again” at an alternative union-proposed plan, rather than close its blast furnaces in south Wales with the loss of up to 3,000 jobs. Ahead of the expected grim news that Port Talbot’s two blast furnaces are to close, Kinnock said there was “still time” for Tata Steel to “pull back from the brink”. He says it would be an an “utterly devastating” decision for Tata to close blast furnaces at its biggest UK plant. Speaking to Sky News, Kinnock said:   “Do we really want to be a country, given the dangerous and turbulent world in which we live, that isn’t able to produce its own steel? “We are very proud of what the Port Talbot steelworks means for Wales and for the entire United Kingdom and we feel passionately here. “There isn’t a single household in my Aberavon constituency that isn’t connected to the steelworks in some way, and the impact would be utterly devastating. “So we are urging Tata Steel and the UK Government to get back round the table with the unions. “There is still time to pull back from the brink and we will be continuing to fight for that with every single fibre of our being.”      8.58am GMT   Demonstrations against the Davos elite have been taking place in several countries this week, highlighting the challenge the WEF faces as it tries to rebuild trust (the theme of this year’s meeting).

Tata Steel is to push ahead with plans to close both its blast furnaces in Port Talbot, a move that could lead to up to 3,000 job cuts. My colleague Rob Davies reports:  The owners of Port Talbot steelworks have rejected a trade union plan designed to keep its blast furnaces running, putting nearly 3,000 jobs at risk and leaving the UK on course to become the only major economy unable to make steel from scratch. In what one union said would be a “crushing blow” to workers and UK steelmaking, Port Talbot’s parent company, the Indian-owned Tata Steel, told workers’ representatives that it could no longer afford to continue production at the loss-making plant in south Wales while it completed a four-year transition plan to greener production. The company, which is getting £500m from the government to help with that plan, broke the news during a summit at the five-star St James’ Court hotel in London, which is owned by the Tata Group.  The announcement is expected this morning. Under the Tata plan, Port Talbot’s blast furnaces will shut down while the company builds electric arc furnaces, which make steel from recycled scrap, a greener and cheaper process.

Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said:  “The Waltham Cross data centre represents our latest investment in the UK and the wider digital economy at large.”  Google says the centre would boost the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), and create jobs, initially due to the construction process.     7.46am GMT  Introduction: Econonic outlook in focus on final day of Davos  Good morning from Davos, where the final day of this year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting is getting underway. Today, world leaders and business chiefs will be considering what lies ahead in 2024, after several days spent discussing crucial issues such as support for Ukraine, the potential and risks of AI, the Middle East crsisis and the global energy transition: Davos will wrap up with the traditional set-piece panel on the global economic outlook, where key figures including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, and Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank. Lagarde’s views on the outlook for interest rates will be interesting, after global stocks and bond markets weakened this week as hopes of early cuts to borrowing costs faded. The experts here in Davos fear that the the global economic outlook is fraught with uncertainty. A WEF survey of top economists this week found that over half expect the world economy to weaken this year. Any escalation of the Middle East conflict risks further disruption to shipping and could push up energy prices – both adding to inflation and slowing growth. During his visit to Davos, foreign secretary David Cameron has been reiterate the 4 things that must happen for a peaceful solution to the Israel-Hamas war: a Palestinian-led government in Gaza and the West Bank, a concrete plan to help reform and support the Palestinian Authority, a major reconstruction plan for Gaza, and a political horizon towards a two-state solution. But the news overnight that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the Biden White House that he rejects any moves to establish a Palestinian state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza is a sharp pushback against pressure for a two-state solution.   Related: Netanyahu tells US he opposes creation of Palestinian state after Gaza war   The agenda  9am CET / 8am GMT: A session on the electoral outlook for 2024 10.15am CET / 9.15am GMT: A session on how to deal with emerging risks and rapid shocks? 10.15am CET / 9.15am GMT: A session on the prospects for the Middle East in 2024 11am CET / 10am GMT: The Global Economic Outlook, with Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of Singapore, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General, World Trade Organization, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, David Rubenstein, Co-Chairman of The Carlyle Group, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, and Christian Lindner, Germany’s Federal Minister of Finance   Updated at 7.48am GMT "

        "content": "The disgraced executive who led Carillion before the construction company’s collapse has landed a senior role at a technology firm in Florida, only months after he was banned from being a company director in the UK. Richard Howson, who received an eight-year disqualification from the Insolvency Service in October, has been named construction president at Tampa-based TECfusions, the Guardian can reveal. The appointment sparked anger among unions and industry experts. TECfusions builds and renovates datacentres and combined heat and power systems, as well as carrying out projects that repurpose industrial sites. The collapse of Carillion was one of the biggest failures in UK corporate history. The company employed 12,000 people and was the second biggest construction firm in the UK before it went bust in January 2018 owing nearly £7bn to suppliers and subcontractors. The construction outsourcer held a clutch of lucrative government contracts, including building hospitals and major road schemes. Howson was chief executive between 2011 and July 2017 and was seen as one of the chief protagonists in allowing the company to slip into insolvency. Howson received £1.5m in his final full year of employment in 2016, which included £591,000 in bonuses. After the company’s collapse, MPs said Howson, along with other Carillion executives, had demonstrated “greed on stilts” and cared more about “fat pay bonuses” than looking out for signs of trouble in the company. Last year, the Insolvency Service announced the directorship ban for Howson, and said he had caused Carillion to report its financial statements in a way that he ought to have known “falsified and concealed” the reality of the company’s deteriorating financial position. It also said that he signed off a £54m dividend in June 2017, which he should have known was not in the interest of the company, or its creditors, given its financial position. Howson started this month at TECfusions, confirming the move to followers on the LinkedIn social network. Rudi Klein, who was part of the government’s Carillion taskforce set up after the collapse, said the reaction to Howson’s job was likely to be “incredulity” and “anger”. Klein, previously the chief executive of the Specialist Engineering Contractors’ Group that represented hundreds of firms which lost money after the collapse, said: “The consequences [of Carillion’s collapse] for thousands upon thousands of suppliers were that either they went under themselves, or they lost phenomenal amounts of money. “They will be appalled, they would have been thinking, ‘OK, that’s it, at least this guy and his colleagues can’t be involved in the management of a company any more’, now they find this out, there will be a lot of anger,” said Klein, now the director of the law firm Kleinlegal. Jon Richards, an assistant general secretary at the Unison trade union, said: “Public service workers were badly let down by Carillion. They will be astounded to learn that the man at the helm, who is banned from being a company director, is now back running things for a company in the US. “There is no punishment or resolution if he is simply allowed to fail upwards by crossing the Atlantic and carrying on as if nothing happened.” According to the company’s website, TECfusions is a “group of world class professionals in the fields of technology, environment and community” that “work together to address immediate real world issues in an environmentally rejuvenate way”. The Guardian has contacted Howson and TECfusions for comment."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-19T15:47:47+00:00",
        "content": "The crisis in the steel industry has been 40 years in the making, people were saying almost a decade ago during one of Tata Steel’s earlier panics about its losses in the UK. And it’s true that the forces of globalisation, Chinese dumping of steel on world markets, weak tariffs and punitively high energy costs in the UK are not new. On top, one can add the fresh imperative to decarbonise a polluting industry. But the Indian-owned company’s decision to close its two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales contains a genuinely new feature. For the first time since the creation of the industry, the UK will be left without capacity to make steel from scratch. The replacement electric arc furnace (EAF) on the site, due to open in 2027 with the help of a £500m government grant, will be fed by recycled scrap. The only other blast furnaces, under Chinese ownership in Scunthorpe, are already due to close and be replaced by EAFs too. The newer technology is cleaner, more efficient and requires substantially fewer workers. But, quite aside from the damage to the town of Port Talbot from the loss of up to 2,800 jobs, there is an enormous question of industrial strategy here. Can Tata’s new EAF, assuming it is built, really be a like-for-like replacement for the blast furnaces that will be lost? If not, is it sensible for the UK to leave itself without the capacity to make virgin steel? No other G20 country has taken that radical step. Fans of EAFs argue the range of steel products that can be produced is wide and securing top grades is really a question of getting good-quality scrap; and, since the UK exports more scrap metal than it uses, supply should not be an insurmountable problem. Sceptics regard that description as too breezy: the output from EAFs is problematic for the automotive industry, introduces hidden costs and relies on a supply chain that may not be secure. A resilient steel industry, goes the argument, cannot bet the house on EAFs: it has to have the ability to produce virgin product. Who’s right? Well, the point is surely that the government hasn’t seriously addressed the question. Ministers argue that Tata’s EAF plan offers the best route towards a “sustainable” steel industry, but you’ll search in vain for a detailed assessment of the economic consequences of giving up the ability to use raw materials to make steel. “Do we really want to be a country, given the dangerous and turbulent world in which we live, that isn’t able to produce its own steel?” asks Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon. It’s an excellent question. The plan from the Community and GMB unions – rejected as unaffordable by Tata – was not an other-worldly proposal that imagined Port Talbot’s blast furnaces could keep polluting for ever, or that every last job could be preserved (just that compulsory redundancies could be avoided). It made the reasonable-sounding point that an EAF-only approach carries industrial risks and has uncertain benefits for global emissions reductions. For purer specialist grades, UK manufacturers may end up importing those volumes from blast furnaces elsewhere. The unions’ proposal called for a two-stage decade-long transition to green steel. In stage one, only one of the blast furnaces – one that is near the end of its life anyway – would be closed and the other would keep producing until 2032. The output would be replaced by an EAF half the size of the model proposed by Tata. In the second stage, the other blast furnace would close but the choice of replacement technology would be kept under review. It could be direct reduced iron and hydrogen, the green steel technology that uses raw materials and is being widely adopted in Germany and Scandinavia. “It is an industrial choice we are making as a country to get rid of blast furnaces,” says Jess Ralston of the independent analysts Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The government keeps talking about energy security, but this move is not going to do anything for energy security. It is going to make it worse.” In commercial terms, Tata’s hard-headed approach is understandable since the two unions said their proposal came with additional costs of £683m. If the government is not willing to offer further subsidies or cut a deal on energy costs, the numbers would have looked daunting from Mumbai. But, from a UK national perspective, a potentially huge step is being taken. Where is the analysis that a country the size of the UK, with an ambition to rewire its electricity grid and reboot its entire energy sector, can do it without virgin steel?"

        "content": "A Boeing cargo airliner made an emergency landing in Florida on Thursday night after what its operator called “an engine malfunction” occurred shortly after takeoff, in the latest setback for the beleaguered company.\n\n Related: Boeing opens factories to airlines and adds more checks after blowout \n\nVideo taken by an eyewitness and posted to social media showed the 747-8 aircraft trailing flames and sparks from its left wing as it circled back to land at Miami international airport at about 10.30pm.\nThe operator, New York-based Atlas Air, said the plane “experienced an engine malfunction soon after departure”. Its crew of five “followed all standard procedures and safely returned” to the airport, it said in a statement, adding it would conduct a “thorough inspection to determine the cause”.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it would be investigating the incident, adding that the eight-year-old Boeing 747-8 aircraft was heading for Puerto Rico. Its preliminary report stated that an inspection after the flight had landed revealed a “softball-sized hole” above one of its four engines, but did not specify when or how it occurred.\nThe plane, colloquially known as a jumbo jet, is equipped with four General Electric GEnx engines. The pilot reported a fire in the left wing engine closest to the fuselage, according to cockpit audio of the emergency call.\n\n\nFootage shows a plane appearing to have a some sort of fire with trailing sparks while flying above Miami! ✈️😳| #ONLYinDADE *🗞️The airplane has reportedlylanded safely at MIA 🙏 pic.twitter.com/PCZZftf798— ONLY in DADE (@ONLYinDADE) January 19, 2024\n\n\n“Mayday, mayday, we have an engine fire,” the pilot calmly told the Miami control tower. “It’s engine number two, and we’re still trying to work it out.” The pilot said the fire started as it was gaining altitude after takeoff.\nIn a statement, General Electric Aerospace said: “Safety is our first priority, and GE Aerospace is providing technical assistance to FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board as they investigate the incident.”\nThe incident follows a series of other recent safety incidents involving Boeing’s aircraft, which prompted the FAA to announce last week it would significantly increase oversight of the company.\nThe agency is already conducting a formal inquiry into the in-flight blowout of a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 aircraft after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, on 5 January. Nobody was seriously hurt, and the FAA grounded 171 737 Max 9 planes while it investigated.\nThe FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker, said the new 737 Max 9 aircraft model had “significant problems” and “we believe there are other manufacturing problems”.\nOn Saturday, a Boeing 737-800 airliner belonging to Nippon Airlines returned to its departure airport at Toyama after a crack was found in its cockpit window.\nThe incidents represent the biggest safety crisis for the company since 346 people were killed in separate 737 Max 8 jet crashes in 2018 and 2019, leading to the grounding of that aircraft model worldwide for almost two years.\nBoeing on Friday referred questions about the flight’s operation to Atlas Air, which it called its “customer”. In a brief statement, it said it was “supporting our customer and will support the NTSB investigation into this incident”.\nThe company’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, had told employees in an all-hands town hall following the Alaska Airlines blowout that he accepted the company was at fault for that episode.\n“We’re going to approach this, number one, acknowledging our mistake. We are going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency, every step of the way,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, Boeing announced it had hired a retired US navy admiral, Kirkland Donald, to act as an independent special adviser to “conduct a thorough assessment of Boeing’s quality management system for commercial airplanes, including quality programs and practices in Boeing manufacturing facilities and its oversight of commercial supplier quality”.\nDonald, Calhoun said, would receive “any and all support he needs from me and from across the Boeing Company” to make safety and quality control recommendations."

        "content": "Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Neither were on the guest list for the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, yet the man in the Kremlin and the other one plotting a return to the White House still managed to dominate Davos. The regular January talkfest high in the Swiss Alps attracted an impressive list of world leaders of all political persuasions. The Chinese premier, Li Qiang, set out China’s five-point plan for rebuilding trust. Javier Milei used his first overseas trip since becoming Argentina’s president to set out his ultra free-market agenda. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, boasted about his success in revitalising France’s economy. Yet in a week dominated by the war in Ukraine, Putin was everyone’s favourite villain. The Russian president once gave a keynote addressat Davos, but that was 15 years ago, before the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. These days Putin is most definitely persona non grata. Neither – judging by the mood at the forum – would Trump be welcomed back with open arms should he become US president for a second time this November. Trump’s agenda – end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, put the US first and retreat from globalisation – runs counter to the Davos orthodoxy. The week began with news that Republicans in the key state of Iowa had chosen Trump to be their candidate to be president, and the scale of his victory reverberated around the conference hall. Politicians and the heads of multilateral institutions were all bombarded with the same question: what will another Trump presidency mean for the world? Privately, many chief executives were thinking about another question: what will a Trump presidency mean for my company’s share price? The leading Kremlin critic Bill Browder said the possibility of a Trump presidency should spur western governments into seizing Russian central bank reserves so that they could be used to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. “Confiscating the $350bn [£276bn] is Donald Trump insurance. It needs to be done before the US election, so that if that were to come to pass, Ukraine can carry on defending itself and win,” Browder said. Browder, the chief executive of Hermitage Capital, was speaking on the fringes of the forum, having baulked at paying the $250,000 entrance fee. He was not alone in seeing Davos as a giant money-making event. Other politicians were also noticeable by their absence. Rishi Sunak would have enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the tech entrepreneurs waxing lyrical about the benefits of artificial intelligence, but being in Davos with the global elite is not deemed a good look for Britain’s wealthiest-ever prime minister. Even if that were not the case, Sunak would have been kept at home by the government’s difficulties in getting its Rwanda bill through parliament. With his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, arriving in the early hours of Thursday by private jet, after being delayed by the Rwanda vote, his Labour counterpart, Rachel Reeves, swept into the vacuum to lead a charm offensive. Accompanied by the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, she sought to portray her party as a government in waiting, telling chief executives at a breakfast that Labour wanted to work with business to increase investment. They later hobnobbed with global executives at a party hosted by JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon and the former prime minister Tony Blair. With Labour roughly 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, and the Tories riven by infighting, it was a message that resonated with bosses. “They were very organised and strategic in systematically using Davos to meet global businesses and sending the message that we are open for business, which is a positive for the UK,” said one. They added: “If you are in business you know you are not going to get a wild lurch in either direction. “She [Reeves] sounded like a Tory chancellor. She realises their only option is to aggressively pursue supply-side reform that can boost growth that can give them that fiscal flexibility.” Another said he was quietly impressed. Reeves and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and Reeves “really listen”, said the executive.” “She has relevant experience. They are the closest thing I’ve seen to that Blair-Brown combination.” In reality, Reeves and Reynolds said little that was new. The shadow chancellor’s message was one of reassurance: Labour has ditched the radical economic strategy of Jeremy Corbyn and will concentrate on measures, such as planning changes, to increase the supply side of the economy. “We intend to build a more secure economy,” Reeves said during one panel event, “but it can’t just be about spending money. We don’t have that luxury.” David Cameron, Britain’s newly installed foreign secretary, was left to fly the flag solo for the government until Hunt’s arrival. The former Tory prime minister drew a direct comparison between the efforts to fight Putin and fascism. “This is the struggle of our generation. It is like being a foreign minister in the 1930s. If you appease aggression you get more of it,” Cameron said. He urged western governments that had frozen the reserves of Russia’s central bank to seize them so that they could be used to rebuild Ukraine’s economy Poland’s foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, sent a warning to those calling for Ukraine to cede occupied territory to Putin in order to secure a peace deal.“There is never a shortage of pocket [Neville] Chamberlains willing to sacrifice other people’s land for their own peace of mind,” Sikorski said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, turned up with one prime objective: to revive flagging western military and economic support for his country. With the conflict about to enter a third year, Kyiv is concerned that war fatigue is setting in, and that the focus of attention has shifted to the Middle East since the Hamas attack on Israel in early October. “You can’t freeze the conflict,” Zelenskiy said. “Putin is a predator who is not satisfied by frozen products. We have to defend ourselves. We can beat him on the ground, in the air and at sea – and we have proved it.” He added: “Putin must regret it [the war]. We need him to lose. Global unity is stronger than one man’s hatred. If anybody thinks this is just about Ukraine they are fundamentally mistaken.” The subtext to Zelenskiy’s appearance was that time could be running out to raise fresh funds, with the prospect of another Trump White House looming. This highlighted a fresh concern: the prospect of AI colliding with the 5 November US election and being weaponised to sow disinformation was at the front of world leaders’ minds. Unlike Trump and Putin, the burgeoning AI sector was very much in evidence in Davos. Along the ski resort’s main promenade, where boutiques and restaurants were temporarily converted into popup corporate showrooms, the nascent industry was everywhere. Marc Benioff, the chief executive of the business IT company Salesforce, said there was a risk AI could go horribly wrong unless it was used responsibly. “Look at what’s happened to social media in the last 10 years. It has been ashitshow. We don’t want that in the AI industry. “It could go really wrong. We must make sure people don’t get hurt. We don’t want an AI Hiroshima moment. We must make sure we get our head around this now.” On the same panel, the man synonymous with the rapid growth of generative AI through his company Open AI, said it was a good thing people were worried about the technology. We have our own nervousness, Sam Altman admitted. Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said governments needed to “wake up” to the risks of AI and disinformation. With the US election on the horizon, the risks of disinformation were “significant and potentially very severe” and a “big driver of mistrust”, she said. But for all that concern, Hunt said the UK welcomed AI and its tech evangelist pioneers. He appeared on stage in the cavernous main hall of the congress centre to call for a “light touch” approach to regulating AI. “The choice we need to make is how to harness it, so it is a force for good,” he said. Hunt may not be chancellor by the time of the Davos summit in a year’s time. Elections in countries containing more than 40% of the world’s population will be held in 2024. The mood at the next World Economic Forum will depend on what happens in the one in early November in the US."

        "content": "The boss of the British Gas owner, Centrica, has said it is “impossible to justify” his £4.5m pay packet. Chris O’Shea said there was “no point” trying to justify his huge pay packet when millions of his customers were struggling to pay their heating bills because of soaring energy costs. O’Shea, who has been the chief executive of Centrica since 2020, received bonuses totalling £3.7m in 2022 on top of his £790,000 salary. The bonuses were paid out as Centrica made record profits of £3.3bn after oil and gas prices jumped after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “You can’t justify a salary of that size,” O’Shea told BBC Breakfast on Friday. “It’s a huge amount of money; I am incredibly fortunate. I don’t set my own pay; that’s set by our remuneration committee.” The comments come as millions of British Gas customers struggle to cover their monthly gas and electricity payments. The typical annual household energy bill shot up from about £1,000 in April 2021 to £2,500 in October 2022, when the government intervened with its energy price guarantee. It remains at just below £2,000, and UK domestic energy customers owe almost £3bn between them on their bills. O’Shea said the £3.7m bonus was “the first bonus I’ve taken in my time at Centrica; for a number of years, I’ve given up bonuses because of hardships that customers were facing”. Asked for the second time by the BBC Breakfast host Charlie Stayt to justify accepting the bonus now, he said: “You can’t, because it’s a huge amount of money to anybody looking at this.” He gestured towards Stayt and the co-presenter Naga Munchetty, and added: “I suppose for the same reason, I mean, if you look, the average salary in the UK is around £30,000. All of us sitting here on this sofa will make substantially more than £30,000. It’s not for me to set my own pay. It’s not for you to set your own pay. “But you’ve got to recognise that when you’ve got people who are struggling, and I look at my mum who’s on the basic state pension, it’s just impossible to justify, so there’s no point in trying to do that.” British Gas is facing an investigation by the regulator Ofgem, launched a year ago, looking into its use of debt collectors to force-fit gas meters in the homes of vulnerable customers, after an investigation by the Times. Last year, O’Shea told MPs that 300 customers had written to the energy supplier since the Times report, saying they had been moved on to prepayment meters incorrectly. “We’re looking into every one of those cases. If that’s the case, we’ll reverse it; we’ll make it right,” he said. The consumer group Which? on Friday named British Gas as “the worst energy supplier for customer service”. O’Shea said British Gas had set aside £100m for a hardship fund, which had helped about 21,000 customers since 2021. Andrew Speke, a spokesperson for the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said O’Shea’s inability to justify his own income was a clear sign that executive pay across the country was out of control. “It’s rare for a CEO to admit their pay is too high, particularly when many FTSE CEOs are complaining that their pay is too low,” Speke said. “Nevertheless, one would expect someone paid such a huge sum to show greater leadership and responsibility and actively challenge the pay-setting process rather than saying he doesn’t deserve it, before shrugging and accepting it anyway. “This is just one example of an executive pay model across corporate Britain, where how much an executive is paid is rarely aligned with how well their company has served its customers and wider society. Mandating workers on boards would be one step towards ending this culture of rewarding failure.”"

        "content": "With temperatures a couple of degrees below zero, the news that Tata Steel had decided to shut down its blast furnaces, with the loss of 2,800 jobs, brought an added note of bitterness to an already freezing cold Port Talbot. Blue skies and a piercing winter sun did little to lift the sombre mood engulfing the town on Friday as it faced up to a bleak and uncertain future, one many fear will parallel the devastation wreaked on neighbouring south Wales communities by the coal pit closures of the 80s. “This plant isn’t part of the community, it is the community. We’re now fighting for a way of life. We’re an endangered species,” said Gary Keogh, 59, a Tata veteran and vice-chair of the Port Talbot multi unions. “The mood is devastation, uncertainty and probably overnight – certainly in my case – it’s going to be anger.” Of the town’s 32,000 residents, 4,000 are employed directly by the plant – with many more jobs dependent on the wages they spend. Tata’s decision to scale back its commitment to the UK means the majority of its workforce will be made redundant. The steelworks are the lifeblood of Port Talbot, molten metal running through the town’s veins for almost 75 years. Keogh has been there for 37 of them, ending his time on the factory floor at the plant’s blast furnace “heavy end”, and now fighting on behalf of embattled colleagues as a full-time union representative. His father, a long-distance lorry driver, hauled steel from the plant, while his grandfather before him worked on the adjacent docks that supplied its furnaces with raw materials. “It’s all linked,” said Keogh, a father-of-two with a son working at the plant. “For every steelworker, times it by four to get an idea of the wider support industry. And that’s not 12,000 people – it’s 12,000 families.” Keogh poured cold water on the Indian conglomerate Tata’s claim that this was a move to green the business by replacing the two blast furnaces, which can make steel from scratch, with electric arc furnaces that will take four years to build and for now can process only recycled steel, pointing out that virgin steel production would probably shift overseas. “It’s nothing to do with green,” scoffed Keogh. “This is about pounds, shilling and pence.  “They want to make their steel in Jamshedpur [in India] … bring it thousands of miles across the ocean on ships with diesel engines, and call it green. It’s time people were honest.” The closures come after years of talks in which Keogh says unions were promised a gradual shift away from blast furnaces. Instead, they feel they have been led to a cliff edge by Tata’s decision to mothball most steel production during the four years it will take to built new furnaces. “We put a credible plan to them and we were told we’d have a just transition,” he said. “But they’ve compressed a possible five- or six-year plan into a couple of months, and simply pressed the button on the nuclear option. It’s a complete betrayal.” Stuart Phillips, 42, a blast furnace shift manager, has spent his entire working life at the plant, starting 26 years ago as an apprentice. “Back then it was classed as a job for life,” he said. “Even in recent times some of the ventures they were looking to put forward would have secured the works for a second or third generation. “We’re in disbelief. Yes – we knew change was coming. But not this fast, or this soon.” He is now hoping that the work involved in decommissioning Tata’s furnaces will buy precious time for some employees, but fears Port Talbot ultimately faces becoming a “ghost town”. “It’s going to decimate us,” he said. “Port Talbot is a relatively disadvantaged area anyway, and the steelworks have been a lifeline. The knock-on effect is going to be huge. Everyone down to the local newsagent is going to be affected.” The sentiment was echoed at one local store, Tollgate Hardware, by Darren Edwards, a 43-year-old employee. “We supply, PPE, hardware – it’ll be a massive effect on us, on all the community, and right the way through to the valleys. Around here, nearly every family is involved in the plant in some way. “OK, they’ve got to green it but like Stephen Kinnock said, they’ve gone off a cliff edge rather than bridged it. People do move on but if you look at what’s happened to some of the valleys towns, there’s nothing there. If the same thing happens here, we’ll be in the same boat.” Keogh, meanwhile, remained defiant in face of the crushing news. “There seems to be a bit of a misconception that we’re going to walk away from this quietly into the night,” he said. “I can guarantee you now, we will fight for every single inch of ground. “We’ll take a ballot. We’ll lead our people for the right option for our survival, and to avoid turning this place into an industrial wasteland. We will not walk away from our industry, our works and our communities.” Ryan Morgan, 37, the owner of Steel Town Coffee Company, fears for the town as he contemplates a possible drop-off in passing trade from overalled workers heading to or from their latest shift. “It’s really sad,” he said. “Port Talbot is known for this plant. It’s like when the valleys lost their thriving coal communities, you go up there now and people don’t want to live in them. They’re stagnant, it’s like going back in time – is that the future for Port Talbot? The steelworks is what keeps the town rolling along.” And what about his business, Steel Town Coffee. Will he have to change the name? “It doesn’t matter whether the plant closes or stays open – Port Talbot will always be steel town.”"

        "content": "The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt- and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable, if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably robust following.   Related: A software entrepreneur wants to empower players to develop their own games   Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a painterly quality to it,” Goodman says. Working with a four-person team, Goodman evokes the work of the French impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, whose pieces played up the sultry power of florals. Beyond being beautiful and a reliable crowd-pleaser, Goodman says that flowers “help me connect to my femininity”. Rife with the colorful, sensuous petals that top her goods, her Instagram grid has earned a handful of high-profile clients, and has been the cornerstone of a business that is in the black three years after she founded it.  The 35-year-old came to her own brand of baking after an eclectic culinary career. There was her time working as a private chef, and the two years she spent as a pastry cook at the Union Square Cafe, Danny Meyer’s acclaimed Manhattan restaurant. Goodman also helped develop and open the now legendary Pudding Shop in the East Village, known for its vast spectrum of flavors, and she spent time as the executive pastry chef at BKLYN Larder, the prestigious prepared foods emporium blocks away from Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Her latest project, ByClio Bakery, began in her home kitchen, during lockdown. Her sugary creations, which have gained a following of other artists and creatives on Instagram, ooze with individuality. There is nothing cookie-cutter or formulaic about Goodman’s cakes, which are packed with unique flavors such as cardamom, saffron and Turkish coffee, and often decked out with flower petals. “I’m just embracing tastes that I’ve gotten to know over time, and I’m sharing them with other people,” says Goodman, who studied baking and pastry arts at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Goodman, who is also an accomplished visual artist, initially sold her cakes through Instagram before setting up shop out of a tiny spot in Greenpoint, also in Brooklyn. A year ago, she moved into her massive and light-filled Gowanus facility. It was “love at first sight, plus it’s close to where my parents grew up”. There, she sells cakes whole and by the slice, along with brownies, cookies and bars. Now celebrating a full year in her store, Goodman says she is ready to take her business to the next level. She has her eye on the success of a new line of packaged cake mixes she is launching and has been promoting via social media. “Instagram is my main marketing tool,” she says.   Related: Experts advise: how can this tiny – and funky - flower shop put down roots and grow?   Goodman believes that her range of ready-made cake mixes offers the most likely – and most immediate – opportunity to grow her company. “The bakery itself is like a boutique and I would like it to stay a boutique,” she says. “But I would like one of the products I’m making to have some more commercial success and growth. Mixes are the most obvious path toward expansion at a cost I can afford at the moment. I have to do something that makes sense for where I’m at right now.” The baker, who can often be found running the cash register until closing, has set a goal of boosting her revenue two and a half times from where it is now. Robust sales of her kits “would allow me to keep on making those custom orders” while still finding growth in other areas – and perhaps hiring more help. But Goodman concedes that the mixes are just one option among many that could help her reach the next level of success without compromising her core focus on individuality. “Ultimately, the only thing holding me back is I haven’t found a direction that makes me feel truly energized,” she says. “If I’m feeling inspired and excited, I’m more likely to get something done.” The Guardian talked to three experts about her current predicament and passions, and asked for advice. Lee Schrager Founder of the New York City and Miami  wine and food festivals I suggest that Clio introduce limited-edition or seasonal cakes, items that emphasize the use of high-quality and fresh ingredients to create a monthly calendar of cakes. This would be a recurring series that would feature a cake each month tied to a specific event – LGBTQ+ Pride month, Black History month, Breast Cancer Awareness month, etc. Such a program would cultivate a strong level of excitement for customers, keep them coming back for more – all the while making positive referrals to friends and families. Make an effort to build strong connections and relationships with your customers by engaging with them on social media. Perhaps offer personalized options for special occasions – for example, send them cards for a discount during birthday weeks or anniversaries. Connect and partner with local events, or wedding planners to expand your reach; collaborations open doors to joint promotions and introduce your cakes to entire new audiences. Focus on a welcome experience in your shop via daily cake-sampling opportunities. Consider displaying photos on a wall of cakes that have been a successful part of your bakery’s history and evolution. Focus on customer service and maintain strict quality measures to ensure consistency in every cake. Consistency is the key to keeping people returning for more. Work with a creative local web designer for easy-to-use online ordering and local delivery platforms. Also, you should implement focused marketing opportunities, online advertising and social media campaigns that highlight the uniqueness and artisanal standards of your cakes. Most importantly, participate in local events like the New York City wine and food festival that give back to the industry and help businesses like ByClio Bakery build strong reputations in their community. Anna Whiteman Principal at Coefficient Capital, a growth equity fund with a speciality in food-focused consumer brands, and founder of Rad Ladies, a network of female entrepreneurs One of Clio’s most unique elements are the folks who eat and love her cakes, and I would recommend that she lean into her strong organic customer base for inspiration on what could be a natural extension for her brand. Taking a cue from a business like Bubble in the beauty space – which has always viewed its customers as organic sources of wisdom – she could create a space (a WhatsApp channel, an Instagram close friends community) to start polling customers on what they’d love to see next and then develop a product line that serves an already loyal audience. The benefit of leaning into community is that it can further engage your core base, create an evergreen product innovation engine, and allows access into fans’ daily lives so she can better understand who she’s building for. Are they always on the go? Cake balls in a pouch! Is the real magic of the cakes in the combination of unique ingredients or in the icing? Maybe a limited drop model of custom flavor mixes – both in store and online. All of this community engagement should help Clio home in on what makes her so unique in the baking category while simultaneously building hype and momentum around her brand. Alison Cayne Founder of Haven’s Kitchen, a packaged sauce and flavor starter company The rule of retail is you pay rent for 24 hours a day, so the more of those hours you can bring in sales, the better. Clio’s plan to consider evening hours is great – any more time she can optimize operations works in her favor. There are two ways to scale a baking business like Clio’s. The first is to open more locations – but the real estate and build-out need to be super inexpensive, the offering relatively easy labor, and the messaging super clear. Essentially, it has to be beyond simple for people to get what they want. Think Levain – big cookies, not much variety, $5, lots of locations with long, long lines. She’ll need a product that people understand and doesn’t require much craft or labor. It’s nice to have a built-in focus group. That’s how we started our sauce line. Then there’s the Rao’s model. The OG, super-elite, hard-to-get-a-rez Italian place akin to a boutique bakery that launched a sauce and just sold to Campbells for $2.7bn. It was a long road to get there, and a lot of people and cash necessary to make that unicorn story happen. But it happens. Clio appears to be more keen on the second model, and if that’s the case, she still needs a simplified product that doesn’t cost a lot to make, with very clear messaging. She’ll need to look at the grocery store shelves and see what needs a glow-up that she can offer affordably. Then she’ll test the heck out of it with her existing customers, so by the time she’s ready to sell it on her website, she already has excitement around it. Once it’s on her website, she can learn a lot more about her customers and get to a nice, contribution margin-positive spot, before she enters retail. The goal needs to be lightweight, long shelf life and easy to ship. There is a third option that my friend Ayeshah Abuelhiga at Mason Dixie Foods pursued. She had a biscuit stand and decided to start selling the frozen biscuit dough for people to bake at home. Now it’s a huge business. Is there a way to do elegant cakes that way? One challenge Clio faces is her website, which makes it seem like ordering a cake is far more complicated than it should be. New Yorkers love the hunt, and scarcity is your friend. But if the goal is to scale, whether into a product (frozen cakes or mixes or decorations) or via more locations, it has to be the simplest recipe, price, use case and message – consumers are simply too busy and too overwhelmed to read, decipher or think too hard. They’ll just move on. The choice Schrager’s responses felt as if they made the most sense for Goodman. She loves the idea of connecting with local wedding planners and being more involved in holidays. “I agree that I need to be more engaged and participate in community and city events,” she says. “I would love to be in the New York City wine and food festival as well as other public forums.” The biggest takeaway she got from Schrager was to update her website and make it easier to order cakes and mixes. “He’s absolutely right – my website has to be simpler and my products need to be simpler to scale via online sales,” she says. “In the meantime, I am lucky that I already have great relationships with most of my customers when they come in because I am so engaged with them both in person and online. I do like the idea of sending birthday discounts for customers as an incentive. Customer service is already one of our strongest qualities.”"

        "published_date": "2024-01-19T11:00:28+00:00",
        "content": "A new report claims “resounding evidence” shows that high corporate profits are a main driver of ongoing inflation, and companies continue to keep prices high even as their inflationary costs drop. The report, compiled by the progressive Groundwork Collaborative thinktank, found corporate profits accounted for about 53% of inflation during last year’s second and third quarters. Profits drove just 11% of price growth in the 40 years prior to the pandemic, according to the report.   Related: US inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December as policymakers mull rate cuts   Prices for consumers rose by 3.4% over the past year, but input costs for producers increased by just 1%, according to the authors’ calculations, which were based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Income and Products Accounts. “Costs have come down substantially, and while corporations were quick to pass on their increased costs to consumers, they are surprisingly less quick to pass on their savings to consumers,” Liz Pancotti, a Groundwork strategic adviser and paper co-author, said. Since pandemic inflation spiked in 2021, a high-stakes debate has played out about its sources. Many progressive economists pointed to corporate profits – or “greedflation” – and supply chain issues as a driver of high prices, while their more conservative counterparts singled out government stimulus cash and high wages. The report’s authors scoured corporate earnings calls and found executives bragging to shareholders about keeping prices high and widening profit margins as input costs come down. The findings come as the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to their highest point in 20 years. The report casts serious doubt on the need for further interest rate hikes, and instead calls for stronger policies to rein in “corporate profiteering”. Prices rose in 2021 as labor costs jumped and supply chain shocks from the pandemic and the Ukraine war snarled shipping traffic and left energy supplies in question. But those issues have in many cases been fully sorted out or are easing, and the labor market has stabilized. Many commodities and services producers’ prices have actually decreased, the report notes. Nearly 60% of the drop in key goods and services’ inputs was driven by large declines in energy costs, such as jet fuel and diesel fuel, while transportation and warehousing costs have fallen by nearly 4% since June 2022 peaks. Still, prices remain high. Consumers are still paying about 25% more for groceries, the report notes as an example. Corporations maintain high prices by exploiting cost shocks caused by events such as the Ukraine war and coordinating price hikes, said Isabella Weber, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economist who was not part of the paper. The shocks create an environment in which it is safe for firms to increase prices as they expect their competitors to do the same, said Weber. “This is a form of implicit collusion,” she said. “Firms do not even need to talk to one another to know that a cost shock is a great time to raise prices. But when costs fall, price-setting firms do not have any incentive to decrease prices.” If no firms launch a price war, Weber added, then companies “hold the line” on prices and widen margins. She pointed to food processors as an example. The paper zooms in on the diaper industry, of which Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark control 70% of the domestic market. Diaper prices have increased by more than 30% since 2019 from, on average, $16.50 to nearly $22. The rise was partly driven by an increase in commodities like wood pulp, a major component of diapers. Wholesale wood pulp prices soared by 87% between January 2021 and January 2023, but last year prices dropped by 25%. Still, diaper prices have not come down with lower costs, the authors say. Groundwork examined earnings calls and found executives at both companies boasting of widening profit margins as input costs decreased. A drop in inputs accounted for about one-third of Kimberly Clark’s profits, company executives said. P&G executives said in their July earnings call they expect $800m in windfall profits because of declining input costs, suggesting they won’t bring down prices.   Related: Biden plans to use cold-war era law in attempt to lower US prices   Meanwhile, workers aren’t faring as well – corporate profits as a share of national income are up by about 29%, and workers’ share of corporate earnings is still down from pre-pandemic levels. The Biden administration has taken steps to strengthen supply chains, Pancotti noted, and Joe Biden recently called on corporations to stop “gouging” consumers as input costs fall. But Pancotti and Weber called for stronger action, pointing to other nations with forms of price control in place. In France, the government intervenes in price negotiations among retailers and producers. Earlier this month, with the government’s support, the supermarket chain Carrefour banned some PepsiCo products from its shelves because of “unacceptable price increases”. Absent strong government intervention in pricing, the 2025 expiration of the Trump corporate tax cuts presents an opportunity to rein in corporations via the tax code, Pancotti said. “We’ve decided as a country that we like to have very large, powerful corporations and we are OK with them being very profitable,” she said. “We need to take a really hard look at how our tax code incentivizes corporate profiteering and ask: ‘Do we as a country want to do something about that?’”"

        "content": "The owners of the Port Talbot steelworks are expected to confirm the shutdown of its blast furnaces on Friday morning, putting almost 3,000 jobs at risk. Trade union representatives have gathered outside the gates of the works in south Wales to protest against the decision, which members have said will be a “crushing blow” to workers and UK steelmaking. The owners of Port Talbot steelworks have rejected a trade union plan designed to keep its blast furnaces running on Thursday. An announcement confirming the decision is expected before midday on Friday, after trading on the stock exchange ends in Mumbai. Shares in Port Talbot’s owner, Indian-owned Tata, rose 2% in trading, ending a two-day decline. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, said there was “still time” for Tata Steel to “pull back from the brink” of what he said would be an “utterly devastating” decision to close blast furnaces at its biggest UK plant. “Do we really want to be a country, given the dangerous and turbulent world in which we live, that isn’t able to produce its own steel?,” he said, speaking on Sky News on Friday morning. “We are very proud of what the Port Talbot steelworks means for Wales and for the entire United Kingdom and we feel passionately here. There isn’t a single household in my Aberavon constituency that isn’t connected to the steelworks in some way, and the impact would be utterly devastating. “So we are urging Tata Steel and the UK government to get back round the table with the unions. There is still time to pull back from the brink and we will be continuing to fight for that with every single fibre of our being.” Tata Steel told workers’ representatives that it could no longer afford to continue production at the loss-making plant in south Wales while it completed a four-year transition plan to greener production. The company, which is getting £500m from the government to help with that plan, broke the news during a summit at the five-star St James’ Court hotel in London, which is owned by the Tata Group. Under the Tata plan, Port Talbot’s blast furnaces will shut down while the company builds electric arc furnaces, which make steel from recycled scrap, a greener and cheaper process. The Guardian understands that about 200 jobs could be saved under a proposal to keep some of the site’s mills open, to roll steel slab. But the decision is a huge blow for a town where the local economy is so heavily dependent on a single factory. The Community and GMB unions had put forward a staggered transition plan designed to provide immediate protection for workers. Under their proposals, the blast furnaces would have remained open during the transition, with at least one continuing to operate until 2032. But at the meeting in London on Thursday, Tata Steel is understood to have told union representatives that the proposal was unaffordable given Port Talbot’s losses, estimated at £1m a day. The UK’s only other blast furnaces, at Scunthorpe, are also slated for shutdown during a similar, potentially lengthy transition process to electric arc furnaces. That would leave the UK as be the only G20 country that cannot make steel from raw materials."

        "content": "The UK economy was probably in recession during the second half of 2023 if the latest retail sales figures were anything to go by. A surprise 3.2% slump in the level of sales in Great Britain during December appeared to show the cost of living crisis was continuing to hurt household finances despite a rise in wages that gave many consumers a bit more spending power. It will be a mild technical recession should the gross domestic product readings for the third and fourth quarters of last year prove to be negative when the latest data is released next month. But the R-word alone would undermine Jeremy Hunt’s claims that the UK is on the right track and make his assertions that tax cuts are the main route out of stagnation look more Truss-like by the day. Hunt was probably unaware when he made his comment in Switzerland on Thursday of the dire situation on the high street (shops make most of their profits in the “golden quarter” of October to December) after City analysts forecast only a 0.5% month-on-month drop. The downturn reported by the Office for National Statistics was unexpected after most of the big supermarket chains reported a healthy festive season and many large high street retailers – Next, for instance – said the same. Only the luxury brands such as Burberry were supposed to be having problems shifting their gear in the last month of the year. Analysts expected sales to remain largely steady after a 1.4% increase in November that was tied to Black Friday and forecast a small uplift in shoppers looking for pre-Christmas bargains. Now it seems those November sales simply stole from December, and rocketing prices, which have pushed up inflation by more than 16% over two years, took their toll. Food sales were down, along with sales of clothing and fuel. It was as if everyone stayed at home and did not drive anywhere in December, or at least not as much as they had for several years. Alex Kerr, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Friday’s figures would subtract about 0.15 percentage points from economic growth in December, “which increases the chances the economy may have ended 2023 in the mildest of mild recessions”. Looking back further, the ONS said a 3.4% annual fall in the volume of sales in 2022 was compounded by a further 2.8% drop in 2023. “This put annual sales volumes at their lowest level since before the pandemic in 2018,” it said. Kerr said: “Looking ahead, some of the drag from higher interest rates on existing mortgage holders may result in a further modest decline in real consumer spending in the first quarter of 2024. “But interest rate cuts from June and the further boost to real household incomes from falling inflation will support a recovery in real consumer spending in the second half of this year.” The figures will turn up the heat on Hunt to address rising business rates, which were cut during the coronavirus pandemic but will rise again in April. The British Retail Consortium, which represents most of the large shop chains, said earlier this week that retailers would face a number of extra costs this year that it fears could increase the already rising level of insolvencies. Ominously, it said: “With an election in the next 12 months, it is time political parties understand the value of retail to the wider economy and set out a clear and cohesive plan for retail in their manifestos.”"

        "content": "Retailers in Great Britain suffered a dire Christmas as cash-strapped consumers cut back on shopping in December, fuelling the biggest fall in monthly sales since shops were forced to close during the coronavirus pandemic in 2021. Sales plummeted 3.2% month on month as retailers across the board suffered as the cost of living crisis resulted in consumers making tough decisions, including choosing between buying food or presents. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the sales slump, which followed a 1.4% rise in November fuelled by Black Friday promotions, hit all retail sectors. “This was the largest overall monthly fall since January 2021, when the reintroduction of pandemic restrictions knocked sales heavily,” said Heather Bovill, a deputy director at the ONS. “Food stores performed very poorly, with their steepest fall since May 2021 as early Christmas shopping led to slow December sales. “Department stores, clothing shops and household goods retailers reported sluggish sales too as consumers spent less on Christmas gifts, but had also purchased earlier during Black Friday promotions, to help spread the cost.”  Interactive  The ONS said the volume of overall sales across 2023 hit the lowest level since 2018. The biggest fall in sales was felt at non-food shops – department stores, clothing, household and other non-food outlets – which decreased 3.9% month on month in December. Retailers partly blamed the scale of the fall on consumers buying gifts earlier than usual in November to spread the cost of Christmas. Department stores suffered a 7.1% fall in sales, with quieter than usual post-Christmas business and a fall in sales of household goods. Other non-food stores registered a 4.5% decline in sales, largely because of a fall in purchases of sports equipment, games and toys, watches and jewellery. Clothing retailers experienced a 1.5% fall in sales and household goods stores dropped 3%, fuelled by a fall in hardware store business. Supermarkets and food stores’ sales dropped 3.1%, after a 1.1% rise in November, the ONS said. The figures are in sharp contrast to the Christmas trading figures reported by several big retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer, which all posted strong festive food sales. There was a 2.1% fall for online retailers, and consumers cut back at the pump, with fuel sales down 1.9%. “The scale of the decline will have surprised many, with retail sales volumes now falling well below pre-pandemic levels,” said Lisa Hooker, the leader of industry for consumer markets at PwC. “In fact, volumes hit their lowest level since May 2020, right in the middle of the first nationwide lockdown of the pandemic.” The ONS said overall retail sales volumes fell 2.8% in 2023, after a fall of 3.4% in 2022, reflecting the impact of high inflation and the cost of living pressures making consumers increasingly cautious about spending. “The longer-term picture remains subdued, with quarterly sales dipping, while annual sales volumes fell for the second consecutive year, to their lowest level in five years,” the ONS’s Bovill said. • This article was amended on 19 January 2024. The 3.2% fall in overall sales in December, and the 3.9% drop at non-food shops, were both month on month decreases, not year on year as an earlier version said."

        "content": "The share of UK’s oil and gas that is exported has increased from 60% to 80% over the last two decades, according to findings that will intensify pressure over the government’s claims that “maxing out” the North Sea will increase the UK’s energy security. On Monday, the government will attempt to pass the oil and gas bill, which they say will boost energy security by creating a rolling annual licensing regime for new fossil fuel contracts. But critics argue that the fossil fuels extracted will be sold on the global market, and the vast majority will be exported.  Energy security, defined by the International Energy Agency as “the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price”, has been a significant concern for the UK in recent years. The issue was thrown into particular relief by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and the decision to stop buying Russian oil and gas. In subsequent months, the Tories made a number of announcements about their plans to continue exploiting UK fossil fuel resources in the North Sea, with the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vowing to “max out” the reserves. His licensing bill, first announced during the king’s speech last November, has been derided by green voices in the Conservative party, with former Tory minister and net zero tsar Chris Skidmore resigning over the legislation plans last Friday. The former energy secretary Alok Sharma, who was president of the Cop26 climate conference, has also condemned the plans. Now analysis of government data by Global Witness has shown that in the 20 years between 2004 and 2023 the UK awarded 1,680 licences to companies to extract oil and gas in the North Sea. The analysis found that the share of UK oil and gas that was exported between 2004 and 2022 rose from 60% to more than 80%. During the same period domestic oil production fell by 60%. This comes against a complex background: the UK’s refinery capacity and its ability to handle its own fossil fuels has fallen sharply during that period. Nevertheless, the analysis has fuelled ongoing criticism of the prime minister’s claims that awarding annual gas and oil licences to offshore companies will help reduce UK’s reliance on international energy markets.  Interactive  Jonathan Noronha-Gant, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said the new law would only prolong the UK’s energy problems. “People want long-term solutions to bring down their bills and fight the emissions damaging the climate,” he said. “New oilfields in the North Sea will line the pockets of rich fossil fuel execs; they won’t help the millions of Brits struggling to pay their bills.” Skidmore said that the reason he had resigned over the bill was because “there is no future energy security in fossil fuels that are extracted by foreign companies, will only be sold on international markets and will have no impact on UK energy security”. He told the Guardian that the UK urgently needed to be focused on “home-owned, homegrown power – which means investing instead in renewables and nuclear power. “It makes no sense for the UK to waste time and investment on economically draining industries that will create stranded assets and stranded communities unable to transition in time to the industries of the future.” Worried constituents who have contacted MPs about concerns over the bill are receiving identical emails repeating the unevidenced claims, suggesting a government coordination of approved lines that MPs can copy and paste in response to queries on gas and oil licences. Emails from Liam Fox, Felicity Buchan and Fay Jones all contain the identical line: “The offshore petroleum licensing bill will strengthen the country’s energy security and reduce reliance on volatile international energy markets and hostile foreign regimes. This will cut bills, cut emissions, and cut our dependence on foreign imports, safeguarding our long-term energy security, supporting families with the cost of living, and delivering on the prime minister’s pledge to grow the economy.” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “This analysis is fundamentally flawed – it wrongly assumes that all licences lead to equal amounts of oil extraction when that is not the case.  “In fact, the UK is now a net importer of oil and gas – with most of our oil being exported to Europe to be refined into the products we use in the UK.  “It is common sense to make the most of our domestic supply and reduce our vulnerability to hostile states, while bringing in tens of billions of tax which we can invest in helping people with cost of living.”"

        "content": "The gold producer Endeavour Mining is to claw back more than $29m in pay and awards after firing its chief executive this month for alleged “serious misconduct” over allegations of a multimillion-dollar “irregular payment”. London-headquartered Endeavour said on Thursday that Sébastien de Montessus, who had led the FTSE 100 company since 2016, would be forced to forfeit $29.1m (£22.9m) in remuneration. De Montessus, who was the highest paid FTSE 100 chief executive in 2021, will receive no salary, pension, benefits, bonus or share awards for the 2023 and 2024 financial years. Endeavour said this amounted to $17.6m. Its remuneration committee also exercised a “clawback” relating to 2021 and 2022, amounting to a further $11.5m. Part of that will be offset against previous long-term incentive plan awards, but De Montessus will have to personally pay back $2.7m. De Montessus said: “I am disappointed with the way this matter has been handled and that I have not been given an opportunity to make proper representations to either the board or the remuneration committee.” This month, Endeavour announced the departure of De Montessus, who was also the president of Endeavour, with “immediate effect”. The company said it was also investigating whistleblower allegations made against De Montessus “relating to his personal conduct with colleagues”. After the announcement, shares in the company dropped 12%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 that day. Endeavour, which operates four mines in west Africa including in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, said the investigation into the payment related to an instruction of $5.9m made by Montessus that it discovered “in the course of a review of acquisitions and disposals”. Montessus has said that the payment was made in 2021 and related to a creditor of Endeavour to “offset” an amount owed to the company to “pay for essential security equipment to protect our partners and employees in a conflict zone”. “The decision had no additional cost to the company and did not benefit me personally in any way,” he said in a statement after Endeavour’s announcement of his sacking and investigations. “I omitted to inform the board that I had arranged for this offset, which I have freely accepted was a lapse in judgment.” Endeavour, which has appointed the veteran mining executive Ian Cockerill as chief executive, said its investigation into the allegedly irregular payment was continuing. Montessus said the whistleblower allegations relating to his personal conduct were unfounded and should not have been made public by the company. “An independent investigation by Linklaters did not uphold any of the personal conduct allegations,” he said. “The inclusion of that allegation by Endeavour Mining in its RNS [stock market] statement on Thursday [4 January] was utterly misleading. The legal position is now being assessed.” In December, BP formally dismissed its chief executive, Bernard Looney, with immediate effect, and said it would deny him more than £32m in pay and share awards, over “serious misconduct” relating to his past relationships with colleagues."

        "content": "The share price of Watches of Switzerland has dived by more than a third in one day – wiping £516m off its value – as the UK’s biggest seller of Rolex and Omega timepieces became the latest luxury retailer to experience a reining in of spending by aspirational shoppers. The plunge on Thursday came after the company said full-year revenues would be £100m below expectations because well-heeled customers were switching their purchasing power to other categories such as fashion, beauty, hospitality and travel. Watches of Switzerland’s poor trading figures echo a series of warnings by UK-listed luxury players in recent weeks including Burberry and Mulberry. Before Christmas, Frasers Group, the owner of the Flannels designer streetwear chain and House of Fraser department stores, also said high-end shoppers were holding back. The warnings appear to mark the end of a boom in luxury spending after the pandemic lockdowns, when the better off splashed the cash they had saved up as holidays, dining out and events were all put on hold. The downbeat 2023 festive season capped a year in which growth in luxury spending slowed to less than 5%, down from the double-digit rates of the previous two years, according to analysts at the US consultancy firm Bain. Within that category luxury goods lost out to spending on high-end hospitality, cruises, cars and yachts. “While such growth normalisation was predictable, not every luxury company was able to anticipate and successfully navigate this trend,” according to the latest Bain-Altagamma study of the global luxury goods market, which was published this week. Moreover, with savings dwindling, property markets flagging and higher interest rates across the world, even the better off are looking at trimming their outgoings. Ultra-high net worth individuals, people with a fortune of at least $30m (£24m), continue to spend unabated on the most luxurious experiences and items. However, more aspirational spenders – who might spend up to £2,000 on a watch against £10,000 – have had to call time or make careful choices. Just as their budgets were coming under pressure, the price of luxury goods such as handbags and coats have risen dramatically in recent years, reducing the spending power of those wanting an occasional pricey treat. The price of Chanel’s 2.55 handbag has risen from $5,800 in 2020 to $10,200 and Prada’s Galleria bag is up from $2,750 in 2021 to $4,300, for example. “Industrywide, the pricing has gotten truly absurd,” the influencer Bryan Yambao noted in an Instagram post in November. With spending power squeezed, shoppers are focusing on must-have brands with maximum bragging power. Luca Solca, a global luxury goods analyst at the research firm Bernstein, said: “I think we are seeing continuing polarisation between winners and losers. Brands that stand at the top of their respective categories – like Cartier and Van Cleef [& Arpels] in jewellery – continue to rise. Brands that are ranking lower – like Burberry and Mulberry against the likes of Hermès and Louis Vuitton – are under pressure.” Solca added that competition between brands was becoming “more intense, with higher and higher investments and brand support costs” that tended to favour larger groups with more resources. Other factors are at play. Brands had hoped that Chinese consumers, who were forced to stay at home for longer periods than those elsewhere during the pandemic, would be flexing their passports for an international spending spree. But inflation in the cost of travel and uncertain economic times in China have put a dampener on this group’s holidaying plans. UK-based brands have blamed poor sales in Britain on the government’s post-Brexit end to VAT tax breaks for tourists in 2021. Outside of the ultra-rich, US or Asian shoppers looking for a handbag or a luxury watch are more likely to allocate more of their budget to boutiques in Paris or Milan rather than London as a result. UK shoppers, meanwhile, are affected by concerns about political uncertainty in an election year and problems in the housing market. Burberry, Mulberry and Watches of Switzerland are also suffering from their own particular problems, according to analysts. Burberry brought in a new boss and replaced the cult fashion designer Riccardo Tisci as creative head with the less splashy Daniel Lee in 2022. The jury is still out on whether Lee’s creations have such strong appeal. Mulberry continued to increase sales internationally but blamed its lower profits on higher costs, with a plethora of projects on the go. Analysts at the investment bank Peel Hunt also raised specific concerns about Watches of Switzerland, which told the City that Rolex, the retailer’s most important brand, was not giving it enough supplies of the most expensive timepieces, for which long waiting lists showed demand remained strong. Solca said: “I think that much of the weakness we are seeing at Burberry and Mulberry is company specific. Don’t get me wrong, luxury demand growth is moderating. But it is not falling off a cliff.” Analysts at Bain are predicting that the luxury market will continue to grow – by up to 4% in 2024. Nick Steyn at the consultancy Anew said: “The concept of luxury is changing and it will be more experiential and less about overt branding.”"

        "content": "The owners of Port Talbot steelworks have rejected a trade union plan designed to keep its blast furnaces running, putting nearly 3,000 jobs at risk and leaving the UK on course to become the only major economy unable to make steel from scratch. In what one union said would be a “crushing blow” to workers and UK steelmaking, Port Talbot’s parent company, the Indian-owned Tata Steel, told workers’ representatives that it could no longer afford to continue production at the loss-making plant in south Wales while it completed a four-year transition plan to greener production. The company, which is getting £500m from the government to help with that plan, broke the news during a summit at the five-star St James’ Court hotel in London, which is owned by the Tata Group.   Related: ‘A golden opportunity’: Port Talbot fights to keep its steelmaking tradition alive   The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, lashed out at the government for providing Tata with funds to pay for its green transition plans without securing a guarantee on jobs. He said the government’s strategy was “£500m for 3,000 job losses”. Under the Tata plan, which is expected to be announced formally on Friday, Port Talbot’s blast furnaces will shut down while the company builds electric arc furnaces, which make steel from recycled scrap, a greener and cheaper process. The Guardian understands that about 200 jobs could be saved under a proposal to keep some of the site’s mills open, to roll steel slab. But the decision is a huge blow for a town where the local economy is so heavily dependent on a single factory. The Community and GMB unions had put forward a staggered transition plan designed to provide immediate protection for workers. Under their proposals, the blast furnaces would have remained open during the transition, with at least one continuing to operate until 2032. But at a meeting in London on Thursday, Tata Steel is understood to have told union representatives that the proposal was unaffordable given Port Talbot’s losses, estimated at £1m a day. The UK’s only other blast furnaces, at Scunthorpe, are also slated for shutdown during a similar, potentially lengthy transition process to electric arc furnaces. That would leave the UK as be the only G20 country that cannot make steel from raw materials. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose Aberavon constituency includes Port Talbot, called on the government to “rethink their approach” and adopt union proposals for a staggered transition to electric arc furnaces, with jobs protected in the meantime. That plan had “fallen on deaf ears” during talks, according to Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a GMB national officer. “Large-scale job losses would be a crushing blow to Port Talbot and UK manufacturing in general,” she said. Shutting down Port Talbot’s two blast furnaces would mark the latest grim milestone in a decades-long decline that has seen production fall from 25m tonnes in 1971 to 6m tonnes, while employment in the sector has slumped from 250,000 to just under 34,000. The industry trade body, UK Steel, said earlier this year that 2024 was a “crossroads” for the British steel industry, at which it could either enjoy a renaissance or continue in managed decline. Once up and running, new electric arc furnaces will be capable of replicating some of the higher quality grades produced by blast furnaces, typically for use in the automotive industry and industrial processes such as food and drinks canning. But making higher grades of steel that way is more difficult, meaning the UK could also lose out on the ability to make some products, relying instead on imports. A government spokesperson said: “We are determined to secure a sustainable and competitive future for the UK steel sector, which is why we have committed £500m of UK government support that will transform the site and protect thousands of jobs – both in Port Talbot and throughout the supply chain. “Engagement with trade unions is rightly a company-led process. There is a broad range of support for staff affected, including a dedicated transition board backed by £80m funding from UK government and £20m from Tata Steel.  “Chaired by the Welsh secretary with ministerial representation from the Welsh government, the board will support both affected employees and the local economy.”"

        "published_date": "2024-01-18T17:32:40+00:00",
        "content": "The government has proposed plans to offer the Drax power plant extra subsidies to burn trees for electricity, provoking a backlash from climate groups and green Tory MPs. Ministers have begun consulting on plans for bill payers to foot the cost of supporting Drax until the end of the decade once its existing subsidy scheme, which pays on average more than £500m a year, ends in 2027. The plans were revealed days after the government gave Drax permission to fit carbon capture technology to the North Yorkshire biomass plant, in a project that could cost bill payers more than £40bn. Drax is expected to receive subsidies for the controversial new project – known as bioenergy with carbon capture, or Beccs – once it begins operations in 2030. However, the company has told ministers it would need a bridging subsidy to support the power plant after its current subsidies run out and before the Beccs project is up and running.   Related: Drax gets go-ahead for carbon capture project at estimated £40bn cost to bill-payers   The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said it was “utterly outrageous” that the government was considering extending subsidies for Drax, which she described as “the UK’s single biggest source of carbon emissions”. “Burning wood for electricity is driving both the climate crisis and deforestation, and these subsidies are a huge cost to the taxpayer,” she said. “Rather than propping up Drax, this money would be better spent on rolling out cheap, clean renewables and a nationwide energy-efficiency programme, to bring down bills and deliver energy security for the long term.” The government’s new proposals defy its own climate advisers at the Committee on Climate Change, which has warned ministers against extending subsidies beyond 2027 for biomass plants that do not use carbon capture. The project has angered green groups who have campaigned against burning imported wood pellets and dispute claims by Drax that the practice is “carbon neutral”. Campaigners, scientists and MPs have also opposed the company’s claims that using carbon capture would make the Drax plant “carbon negative”. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “Households have been forced to prop up Drax’s destructive activity to the tune of over £600m a year in subsidies for too long and shouldn’t be expected to pay a penny more, especially when the cost of living is still sky-high.” Sir Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP for Worthing West, told the Telegraph this week there should be “no further subsidies for burning trees in our power stations beyond the current 2027 contracts” and that the government should instead aim to increase tree cover and renewable energy generation. Will Gardiner, the chief executive of the Drax Group, said the extra support was necessary so that the power plant could “continue to play an important role in the UK’s energy security” while investing in carbon capture to help the UK meet its climate targets. A government spokesperson said it was focused on protecting people’s bills and that any potential support would be subject to a rigorous value for money assessment."

And even if there is a cut, it’s still going to be better than last year, Okonjo-Iweala points out.\nShe also says there are ‘bright spots’ in world trade, including in digital trade and green trade, which has tripled over the last two decades.\nOkonjo-Iweala adds:\n\nYes we are worried, but trade is very resilient, and we are optimistic we can pick up on some bright spots.\n\n\n\nGiven current geopolitical fragilities, how can trade & investment remain as growth engines? DG @NOIweala sees some \"bright spots\" as services and digital trade are growing strongly and WTO members are close to finalizing an Investment Facilitation Agreement. #wef24 #WTOatWEF24 pic.twitter.com/wHYmUKtu0d— WTO (@wto) January 18, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.11pm GMT\n\n\n 1.08pm GMT \n\nOver at Ukraine House, a temporory pop-up in a shop on the Davos promenade, delegates have heard fresh warnings about the dangers of appeasing Russia.\nSerhii Plokhii, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, warned that the world leadership’s policy of appeasing Vladimir Putin led to the war in Ukraine:\nPlokhii said:\n\n“The road to this war is very much a story of appeasement. It’s the appeasement of the 1930s replayed in the 1990s and 2000s.\nUnfortunately, it’s hard to fully realize this until a catastrophe of such a scale as this war happens, and you get very cautious about using the terms like ‘appeasement’ and parallels with the 1930s.\nBut having the largest war in Europe since World War II, I’m afraid that we don’t have any other choice but to look back and learn the lessons from the 1930s and 1940s.”\n\nAs covered earlier, David Cameron compared the current situation to the 1930s this morning.\n\nUpdated at 1.25pm GMT\n\n\n 12.25pm GMT \n\nSpeaking of oil…Iraq is trying to lower its dependency on oil revenues, Davos heard this morning.\nSpeaking at WEF, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said Iraq has set a goal in a three-year budget to reduce dependence on oil revenue from 95% to 80%.\n\nUpdated at 12.38pm GMT\n\n\n 12.20pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 12.16pm GMT \nIEA sees slower oil demand growth\n\nAway from Davos, the growth in global oil demand will fall by almost half in the year ahead due to weaker economic signals from China and other major economies, according to the International Energy Agency today.\nThe IEA’s influential monthly oil market report has found that world’s demand for oil would climb by 1.2m barrels per day this year, compared with an average of 2.3m barrels a day in 2023.\nMeanwhile, the world’s oil supply is forecast to rise by 1.5m barrels a day to a new high of 103.5m b/d, fuelled by record-setting output from the US, Brazil, Guyana and Canada. \nThe IEA said that if the Opec oil cartel abandons its policy to hold back oil supply from the market it could create a “substantial surplus” of crude in the market, which would likely weigh down market prices.\nThe global oil price rose slightly, to around $78.26 a barrel, following the IEA’s report which lifted the group’s oil demand growth forecasts by 180,000 barrels a day from its previous projection. \nThe oil price remains well below the 2023 average of $84.50 a barrel despite ongoing sanctions against Russian oil exports, the Israel-Gaza conflict and shipping disruptions through the Red Sea.\n\nUpdated at 12.38pm GMT\n\n\n 11.48am GMT \n\nThe Davos session on artificial intelligence wrapped up with a nod to the elephant in the room – Sam Altman’s shock dismissal from OpenAI last year, and his rehiring a few days later, after a staff revolt and support from major investor Microsoft.\nQ: what did you learn from the most widely publiced boardroom scandal in recent decades?\nAltman takes a moment to think what he can say about a tumultuous few days in which he was fired, then hired by Microsoft, then returned to OpenAI while most of the board who had sacked him departed.\n\n Related: Sacking, revolt, return: how crisis at OpenAI over Sam Altman unfolded \n\nHe spreads his arms and declares:\n\nAt some point you just have to laugh, at some point it just gets so ridiculous.\n\nOne lesson, he says is that “you shouldn’t leave important but not urgent problems dangling”.\nHe says OpenAI knew its board was too small, and didn’t have the level of experience we needed [which was resolved through the deal to bring Altman back].\n\n Related: Microsoft to join OpenAI’s board after Sam Altman rehired as CEO \n\nBut more importantly, he says, as the world gets closer to AGI [Artificial general intelligence] the stakes, the stress, the level of tension is going to go up.\nHe explains:\n\n“Every one step we take closer to very poweful AI, everyone’s character gets +10 crazy points.\nIt’s a very stressful thing, and it should be, because we’re trying to be responsible about very high stakes.”\n\nAltman adds that he expects “more strange things”, as the world gets closer to very powerful AI.\nSo it’s verty important to have more preparation, more resilience, more time thinking about what can go wrong.\nAltman adds that the most important he learned was the strength of his team.\n\n Related: OpenAI staff threaten to quit en masse unless Sam Altman is reinstated \n\n\nUpdated at 12.29pm GMT\n\n\n 11.18am GMT \nHunt: global AI standards must reflect liberal democratic values.\n\nJeremy Hunt tells Davos that Western goverments must talk to China about artificial intelligence, and that it is very important that global AI standards reflect liberal democratic values.\nHe says:\n\nWhen it comes to setting global AI standards, it’s very important that they reflect liberal democratic values.\nBut, I think it is really important that we talk to countries like China.\n\nHunt points out that Sam Altman, alongside him on today’s panel, has a sign in his OpenAI office that says ‘no-one knows the future’.\nBut, Hunt says, “we do have agency over the future”, and that is why there is tension between the two (AI developers, and policymakers).\nHunt says we are “incredibly lucky” that people like Sam Altman are helping to transform humanity’s prospects for the future.\nNo-on in the room here in Davos today thinks the world would be better without AI, Hunt argues. “But we have choices”.\nHunt says:\n\nThe choice we need to make is how to harness it, so it is a force for good.\nI actually think that means talking to countries like China.\nOne of the ways it would be a force for bad is if it just becmae a tool in a new geo-strategic superpower race, with much of the energy put into weapons rather than things that could transform our daily lives.\n\nOne way to avoid that is to have discussions with countries like China over common ground, Hunt says.\nHe adds that the benefits of AI should be spread throughout the world, and not just concentrated in advance economies.\nHunt says previous technological revolutions, such as the industrial revolution and computer revolution, succeeded where the benefits were spread evenly across society, not concentrated in small groups.\nHe adds:\n\nOtherwise that will deepen some of the fractures that are already, in my view, taking us in the wrong direction.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.33am GMT\n\n\n 11.01am GMT \nBenioff: don’t want to see an AI Hiroshima\n\nOn the dangers of AI, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff tells Davos that our imaginations are filled with what happens when AI goes well and goes wrong.\nPointing to science-fiction films, Benioff cites HAL (in 2001: A Space Odyssey), Minority Report, and War Games\nWe don’t want to see “an AI Hiroshima”, Benioff warns WEF.\nSo we need to get our heads around regulation and safety now.\nHe points to the benefits from AI, saying customers will get better service while CEOs will get better profit margins.\nBut, we have to do it with the right values, he points out.\n\n\n\n 10.51am GMT \n\nSam Altman says OpenAI was surprised to be sued by the New York Times for copyright infringement last month.\nAltman says he thought OpenAI were in productive negotiations with the NYT, and want to give the New York Times a lot of money in return for using its content.\nAltman explains that OpenAI want to be able to supply links to external content to answer users’ questions, and to pay for that.\nReminder: The NYT’s case is that OpenAI used its news articles, investigations, opinion pieces, reviews and guides to build and train artificial intelligence products.\nAltman reveals today that future AI models will be able to take smaller amounts of higher-quality data, and process it better.\nAfter all, humans don’t need to read 2,000 biology books for a school biology course – one, or maybe 3, is enough.\n\n\n\n 10.43am GMT \n\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman argues that it’s a good thing that people are nervous about AI.\nWe have our own nervousness, he admits.\nHe says Ai developers need to get input from society about what the values of the system should be.\nIt is important to put these systems into people hands, so we can make the necessary course corrections, Altman adds.\n\n\n\n 10.40am GMT \nHunt suggests AI could improve public services, lead to tax cuts\n\nJeremy Hunt tells Davos that he favours “light touch” regulation of artificial intelligence, as it is at such an early stage.\nOtherwise, you risk stopping the golden goose growing, he warns.\nHe gives an example of AI’s fallibility – saying he asked an AI system “Is Jeremy Hunt a good chancellor”, and was told that he wasn’t the chancellor at all.\nDespite these flaws, Hunt says we can all do very well out of AI.\nAnd he suggests that artificial intelligence can solve some of the big problems we face.\nFor example, when the next pandemic happens, Hunt says, we don’t want to have to wait a year for a vaccine. If AI can shrink the timescale to develop and deploy the next vaccine from a year to a month, is a big step forward.\nHunt adds there is a lot of anger around the world about tax\nIf AI can transform public services, and lead to more efficient public services requiring less tax, that is a big win, Hunt says.\n\n\n\n 10.29am GMT \nBenioff: AI regulation mustn't be another fucking shit show\n\nMarc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, says we must “pass over the bridge of trust” regarding AI.\nHe says the UK’s AI safety summit last year was “amazing actually,” as it brought so many key players together.\nOn the capabilities of AI, Benioff cautions that “We’re at a threshold moment, but we’re not properly there yet.”\nAnd on the issue of regulation, Benioff says we must learn from the failure to regulate social media, which he says has been “a fucking shit show” over the last decade.\n\n\n“Regulation of social media was a fucking shit show … do we want the same thing to happen in the case of AI?” Pretty much the broad consensus this year on the magic mountain … but are we moving nearly fast enough? @Benioff⁩ ⁦@sama⁩ at ⁦@wef⁩ #Davos this morning. pic.twitter.com/uKrDjoxtXQ— Robert Muggah (@robmuggah) January 18, 2024\n\n\nwant a good partnershp\n\n\n\n 10.22am GMT \n\nQ: What is the future for humans in an AI world?\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman replies that AI mean we all have access to a lot more capability, and we will make decisions about what will happen in the world.\nHe explains that humans care what other people think. He reminds Davos that chess was one of the first victims of AI when Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov. \nAt the time, Altman says, people said this was the end of chess.\nBut today, chess has never been more popular than it is now. While no-one, or hardly anyone, wants to watch two AI chess players play each other.\nBut he concedes that while we have seen many technological breakthroughs before, it does feel different this time. General-purpose cognition feels different, Altman adds.\n\n\n\n 10.15am GMT \n\nSam Altman begins by telling Davos that artificial intelligence systems are currently at extremely limited levels of ability – much lower than we’ll get later this year, yet alone future years, he says tantalisingly.\nAltman explains that the OpenAI-style of AI is good at some things, but not life or death situations.\nIt’s sometimes wrong and sometimes right, so you don’t want it to drive your car, but you’re happy to use it to brainstorm ideas, he explains.\nAltman says people have found ways to make OpenAI’s ChatGPT super-useful.\nAnd if they know that the output could be totally wrong, that’s OK.\nIt’s arguably more dangerous if it’s right 99.999% of time, because people would let their guard down.\n\n\n\n 10.06am GMT \n\n\n\nChancellor @Jeremy_Hunt now on stage at Davos with Sam Altman and others discussing AI #WEF24 pic.twitter.com/J6TuUTtagD— Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) January 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.05am GMT \n\nNext up…. a panel on Technology in a Turbulent World, which will look at the issue of artificial intelligence.\nJeremy Hunt, the UK chancellor, takes his seat, along with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, Marc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce, Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO of Accenture, and Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer.\n\n\n\n 10.01am GMT \nIsrael president calls on international community to reject genocide claim\n\nIsrael’s president has told the World Economic Forum that it is “outrageous” that South Africa has brought a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, over its conduct in the Gaza war.\nIsaac Herzog tells delegates here in Davos that South Africa “basically support the barbarism we have seen on October 7”, which he says includes supporting sexual and gender-based violence.\nHerzog declares it is “a game of hypocrisy” that South Africa is using the convention against genocide, which was enacted following the Holocaust in the second world war, carried out against the Jewish people.\nThe state of Israel is defending itself within international law, he insists.\nHerzog says he hopes Israel’s case will be heard “loud and clear”\nAnd he calls on the international community to reject the genocide claim against Israel.\n\n\n\n 9.50am GMT \n\nWe are a peace loving nation, Herzog continues, saying Israelis are striving for peace\nWe care for our neighbours, but we are not prepared to be attacked, he adds.\n\n\n\n 9.48am GMT \n\nQ: Once the Israel-Hamas war is over, how could a two state solution be reached?\nPresident Herzog says Hamas has a jihadist ideology, and wants to eliminate Israel.\nIsrael may have been naive enough to think Hamas could change, he suggests.\nHe says Israelis have several questions, including: are they being offered real safety, what will it be, and will it actually guarantee safety for their people.\nHe adds that Israel’s lost faith in the peace process in the past, because they could see that terror is being glorified by our neighbours.\nHerzog adds that normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia is the key to reaching an exit from the war, and moving into a new horizon.\n\n\n\n 9.35am GMT \n\nOn the issue of supplies into Gaza, Herzog says the international community has not sent the full 400 humanitarian trucks a day that Israel can screen.\n[earlier this week, aid officials in Gaza warned that “pockets of famine” already exist in the territory, due to a lack of humanitarian supplies].\nHe is praying that medicine which are being sent into Gaza via the Qatari-French deal will reach the hostages.\n\nUpdated at 9.36am GMT\n\n\n 9.30am GMT \n\nPresident Herzog points out that the Houthis are raising the cost of living for everyone, through the attacks on vessels in the Red Sea that have forced ships to reroute.\n\n\n\n 9.28am GMT \n\nQ: what is your message to Palestinians who don’t support Hamas?\nPresident Herzog says he has been calling for peace with Israel’s neighbours for years.\nBut terror cannot be accepted; it has to be totally stopped and made out of the question.\nHe says people who support Hamas are supporting barbaric terror.\nHe then talks about the Hamas infrastructure found in shops, living rooms, bedrooms, and schools in Gaza.\n\nWe care, we care, it is painful for us that our neighbours are suffering so much.\n\nBut they are entrenched in a network of terror, which Israel is determined to remove.\nHe says he is not shying away from the human tragedy in Gaza, but Israel needs to defend itself from terror.\n\n\n\n 9.21am GMT \n\nThere is an “empire of evil” eminating from Tehran, Israel’s president Isaac Herzog warns Davos.\nBillions of dollars are being spent to destabilise the stability of the world, he says, with Iran funding proxies all around the region, to undermine any peace process.\nThey must be faced by a very strong coalition, he adds.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHerzog also says he wants a better future for the Palestinians who are our neighbours.\nBut if you speak to Israeli citizens, he says, they cannot think about the peace agreement because everyone wants to know if they can be promised security.\nEvery Israeli wants to know they won’t be attacked from the north, south or east, Herzog says.\n\nUpdated at 12.11pm GMT\n\n\n 9.12am GMT \n\nPresident Isaac Herzog begins by telling Davos delegates that Israel’s world was shattered on 7 October by the Hamas attacks.\nHe explains Israeli’s suffered atrocities including rapes, the chopping of heads, the burning of families.\nAnd he cites the example of Kfir Bibas, who turns 1 in Hamas captivity today after he, his four-year-old brother Ariel and parents Yarden and Shiri Bibas were taken hostage.\nHerzog says he calls on those at Davos, and indeed the “entire universe” to work endlessly to release all the hostages who are still held.\nThe oldest hostage is 85 year old, he adds, and many are people of peace.\n\n\n\n 9.05am GMT \n\n\n\nIsraeli president Herzog in Davos with a photo of Kfir Bibas, a 1 year old Israeli baby held hostage by Hamas in Gaza pic.twitter.com/Xmp5JTo6Sw— Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) January 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.04am GMT \n\nNext up, Israel’s president Isaac Herzog has arrived on stage for a conversation\nWEF’s founder Klaus Schwab welcomes him, pointing out that this is a very critical time for Israel and the Middle East, and credits Herzog with delivering “positive change for your country”.\n\nUpdated at 9.18am GMT\n\n\n 8.49am GMT \n\nElsewhere in Davos this morning, the boss of Barclays has said he is “very optimistic” about the UK.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan told CNBC that he thinks the UK consumer is in “very decent shape”, helped by the drop in energy prices from recent highs.\nVenkatakrishnan said:\n\nGrowth is not great, but growth is fine. It’s not as strong as the United States. \nBut you know, there’s so many institutional advantages in the UK, and it’s the home of so much innovation, so much technology. \n\nVenkatakrishnan also argued that political risk in the UK is “far less than it’s ever been”, citing Rachel Reeves’ visit to Davos this week.\nHe added:\n\nThis election, whenever it comes, is not Margaret Thatcher versus James Callaghan [as in 1979].\nThe difference in economic policies between the two, and they’re both striving to say so, is fairly minimal.\n\n\n\n\n 8.07am GMT \nRubenstein: Trump probably not as big a Ukraine supporter as we'd like\n\nDavid Rubenstein, co-chairman of The Carlyle Group, the asset management firm, is also on this morning’s panel.\nHe’s asked whether American support could waver come November, the month of the presidential election.\nRubenstein replies that “it’s obviously difficult situation” in the United States because of the politics of this situation. \n\nWe all know that if President Trump were to be reelected, he is probably not as big a supporter of Ukraine as all of us would wish. \n\nBut, adds that Rubenstein the business community and others in the United States could influence Trump by putting some pressure on him. \nSo we shouldn’t view this as a lost cause, nor view it as a certainty that Trump will get elected, Rubenstein adds.\n\n\n\n 8.01am GMT \n\nCanada’s finance minister Chrystia Freeland tells the Ukraine breakfast that the moral, political and legal case for using the frozen Russian central bank reserves for Ukrainian reconstruction “is strong”.\nBut she cautions…\n\nWe really recognise that this has to be something that allies do together, and that allies have to come to their own conclusions.\n\n\n\nDavos - Duda, Cameron, Kuleba, Freeland, pretty clear there is agreement now on confiscating the $300bn+ in immobilised Russian assets and transfer to Ukraine. It is going to happen. G7 at end of Feb will sign off on it. Germany will have to roll-over.— Timothy Ash (@tashecon) January 18, 2024\n\n\nFreeland says Canada thinks it has $134 of frozen Russian funds – probably a sign that the Russian didn’t think Canada was a welcome place for their money.\n“That’s not a bad thing, from our point of view,” she adds.\nFreeland also warns that Putin thinks he’s going to win, because he believes that dictatorship is stronger than democracy. \n\nI think democracy can win, I think democracy is better. \n\n\n\n\n 7.47am GMT \n\nLord Cameron is then asked about Ukraine’s call for European defence capabilities to be aligned – is that realistic?\nCameron says he thinks it is, but it’s definitely the area where the greatest amount of attention is needed. \nHe says countries such as Britain, France and Poland have been going through their inventories of weapons, to find what they can give to Ukraine, and also bought up a huge amount of legacy area era Soviet equipment from around the world to resupply the Ukrainians.\nCoordinating production with multi-year contracts is a clear demonstration that “we’re in this for the long term”, Cameron adds, and is one of the most important outcomes from meetings such as WEF.\nCameron also calls for the sanctions put in place against Russian individuals and entities to be properly policed. Just putting sanctions in place isn’t enough.\nHe says:\n\nWe’ve got to make sure that third countries aren’t going round the sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n 7.38am GMT \n\nDmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, tells this morning’s Ukraine breakfast that Ukraine has been encouraged and reassured by the reception that president Zelenskiy received in Davos this week.\nAsked what Ukraine most needs, Kuleba says there are two things – air defence, and the use of Russia’s frozen assets.\nAir defence means planes, missiles, interceptors and radio electronics, he says.\nAnd if Ukraine can protect its skies, and throw Russia out of them, it will be in a much stronger position.\nKuleba also pushes for Ukraine’s supports to build better cooperation between their defence industries, to ensure the sustainability of supplies.\nOn the frozen assets, he says Russia must pay for the damage in Ukraine, and doesn’t buy the arguments that there are legal constraints within financial regulations that prevent them being used.\nThe assets frozen in only three countries, Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland, would fund the repair of all infrastructure damage in Ukraine, such as airports, bridges. and roads, Kuleba says.\nIf you also take the 180bn euros of Russian assets frozen in the Euroclear system in Belgium, that would fund a wider recovery effort and repair hospitals and schools, \n\n\n\n 7.19am GMT \n\nLord Cameron adds that Ukrainians are incredibly brave and incredibly united.\nHe reveals that someone said the other day that president Zelensky’s approval rating has slipped from 90% to 80%. \nCameron jokes that he used to dream about 40%, never mind 80%, when he was prime minister.\n\n\n\n 7.17am GMT \nDavid Cameron: This is like the 1930s\n\nNext up, Lord Cameron, who says the Ukraine war is the “struggle of our generation”.\nThis is like being a foreign minister or a prime minister in the 1930s, he tells this morning’s Stand With Ukraine? event. And we know from those days that if you appease aggression, you get more of it, he points out.\nBritain is “right behind Ukrainians in this struggle for as long as it takes”, Cameron insists.\nHe reminds us that Rishi Sunak has pledged £2.5bn of British support for the next year, and urges colleagues in America and in the European Union to bring forwards their own, larger packages.\nCameron’s message to American colleagues is that they have spend 10% of their defence budget, and achieved a 50% destruction of Russia’s pre-war military equipment without the loss of a single American life.\nThat is an amazing investment, Cameron adds.\nHe also repeats a point he made yesterday – if you zoom out, the war has been a strategic disaster for Putin, who has lost half the territory he took in the invasion two years ago.\nCameron says:\n\nHe’s lost half his military equipment. He’s had 300,000 casualties, [he’s seen] NATO get bigger and stronger with the addition of two highly capable countries in Finland and Sweden. He’s lost 20% of his Black Sea Fleet to a country that only has a relatively limited navy.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.30am GMT\n\n\n 7.08am GMT \n\nPoland’s president Duda then urges world leaders not to become fatigued over the Ukraine war.\nHe warns about a “coalition of evil” which is prepared to take risks to run the global order.\nDuda says that if Putin prevails in Ukraine, it would send a clear signal to the whole of the world, and encourage his supporters to ramp up actions against the Western world.\nUkranians must decide their own future, he continues – no-one else can decide it.\nAnd the conflict will only end with Moscow’s full retreat. They are the aggressor, who attacked an independent and sovereign country, Duda continues.\nAnd if Russia were to win, Putin would not stop with Ukraine, Duda fears.\nOther countries, such as in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, might be become Russia’s next victim, he warns.\n\n\n\n 7.00am GMT \nDuda: Putin decided to set the world in fire\n\nAndrzej Duda, the president of Poland, says that Vladlimir Putin has decided to “set the world on fire”.\nDuda warns the Ukrainian breakfast event that:\n\nI’m absolutely sure that we can say, 30 years after the Soviet Union collapsed, that now we are witnessing the rebirth of Russian imperialism in its bloodthirsty version.\nWithout any doubts, Putin decided to set the world in fire.\n\nDuda reminds us that we are still witnessing the biggest armed conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War. \nAnd he urges Davos delegates to visit an exhibition here, documenting Russian war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 6.53am GMT \nIntroduction: 2024 wil be 'moment of truth' for Ukraine\n\nGood morning from Davos, where world leaders, business chiefs and other members of the global elite continue to attend the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting.\nWe start with Ukraine this morning, as UK foreign secretary David Cameron is attending the annual Ukrainian Breakfast discussion here.\nThe topic: Stand With Ukraine?\nThe event, which is also being attended by Poland’s president Andrzej Duda, is hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, and international investment advisory group EastOne.\nVictor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist, opens the event, warning that 2024 will be the “moment of truth” for Ukraine.\nPinchuk tells an audience of Davos delegates here that Ukraine’s international partners have provided a lot of support; Ukrainians are so grateful for this and we will never forget this, he says.\nBu, he warns, there is a difficult truth:\n\nIn war it does not matter if you did a lot. It matters only if you did enough.\n\nPinchuk says that without more support, Ukraine will have too little weapons to win.\nTime is running out, he says, and we are at the critical point.\nPinchuk says 2022 was the year in which eveyone underestimated Ukraine. in 2023, everyone underestimated the aggressor. 2024 will be the moment of truth, he insists.\nMore to follow….\nAlso coming up today\nUK chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also attending WEF today; he’ll be speaking on a panel about ‘technology in a turbulent world’.\nThe Treasury say Hunt will be championing British excellence in science and technology, and will “bang the drum on investment” into the UK.\nHunt says:\n\n“I’ll be in Davos to tell the world that Britain, a nation of great innovation, is on the up and open for business.\n“We boast some of the best and brightest businesses in sectors of the future like digital technology and life sciences. It’s these areas of strength that are going to drive growth across the UK economy in years to come.”\n\nBut, Hunt’s trip could be overshadowed by fears back home that Tata Steel will confirm plans to shut down much of its production at the Port Talbot steelworks during a crunch meeting with trade unions,\n\n Related: Tata Steel to confirm shutdown of Port Talbot blast furnaces, sources claim \n\nThe Middle East conflict will also feature here in Davos, with Israel’s president Isaac Herzog and Iraq’s president Mohammed Shyaa Al Sudani both due to address delegates.\nThe agenda\n\n7.30am CET/6.30am BST: Ukrainian Breakfast discussion, including Poland’s president Andrzej Duda, and UK foreign secretary David Cameron.\n10am CET / 9am BST: A Conversation with Isaac Herzog, President of Israel\n10.30am CET / 9.30am BST: A Conversation With Mohammed Shyaa Al Sudani, Prime Minister of Iraq\n11am CET / 10am GMT: Technology in a Turbulent World, with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, Marc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce, Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer\n3pm CET / 2pm GMT: Russia: What Next?

        "content": "Welfare advocates have renewed calls for the Labor government to drop the work for the dole program after one of the country’s most well-known not-for-profits announced it was cutting ties with the scheme over concerns it pushes participants into hardship. The Brotherhood of St Laurence announced this week it would no longer participate or use jobseekers from the program, saying it is “not in the best interests of people who are unemployed”. “If people do not engage when required, their payments may be suspended,” the organisation said in a statement. “As unemployment payments are already well below the poverty line, this pushes people into even greater hardship.”   Related: Jobseekers say Australia’s employment system forcing them into jobs with ‘terrible hours, conditions and pay’   Some jobseekers are required to do a work for the dole activity which sees them placed at a government or not-for-profit organisation as part of their mutual obligations. Mutual obligation requirements are meant to ensure jobseekers are actively looking for work by making them study courses, attend interviews, meet job providers or work for the dole. If they do not complete the tasks their payments are suspended. In a statement, the Brotherhood of St Laurence referred to a recent house select committee report into Workforce Australia Employment Services which found that, for most people, work for the dole “does not increase employability, fails to enable social participation, and creates safety risks in some cases”. The report called for an overhaul but stopped short of recommending the program be stopped altogether, instead saying it was a last resort for a “small minority of people” who fail to “meaningfully engage”.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  BSL said it “believes in supporting agency and choice and using the best available evidence to improve outcomes – work for the dole is not consistent with this way of working”. “Through our advocacy, we are seeking improvements to the employment services system and the replacement of programs like work for the dole with meaningful support for people who are unemployed.” As of December last year, there were 361 host organisations and 1,157 jobseekers signed up to the program. The federal minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, and the assistant minister, Andrew Leigh, did not respond to questions about the program but a spokesperson for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said it would continue to work with providers about issues outlined in the report. “It is vital we continue to provide, and improve, services and support to our clients to help them meet their goals and move towards employment,” the spokesperson said. “This includes ensuring that services, supports and requirements are personalised to reflect each client’s needs and circumstances.” The government is carefully considering the findings and recommendations of the inquiry report, the spokesperson said, noting that the house select committee did not recommend ending the work for the dole program. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson Jay Coonan called on Burke to end the program.“ Why is the government making anyone work for free, let alone people who live hundreds of dollars a week below the poverty line?” he said.   Related: Major Australian employment service accused of claiming credit for work jobseeker found herself   “This is a program that killed Josh Park-Fing and eight years on there has still been no justice.” Park-Fing, 18, was killed while working for the dole after he fell from a trailer and suffered a fatal head injury in 2016.  The chief executive of Acoss, Cassandra Goldie, said “instead of penalising people who are unemployed, the government should offer an annual jobs and training package to people who are without paid work long term”. “This should include a wage subsidy, quality training, a job offer or health and social supports tailored to individual need. We also cannot reform employment services without raising the punishingly low rate of jobseeker and related income support payments to at least the pension rate of $78 a day.” Guardian Australia contacted the Salvation Army and Lifeline regarding their engagement with the program but did not receive responses. The national president of St Vincent de Paul Society, Mark Gaetani, said his organisation agreed there were “significant and numerous” issues with the program. He said the government should overhaul work for the dole so it worked better for participants. “We urge the government to respond promptly to the inquiry’s extensive recommendations as these workforce-related practices affect the lives of many Australians who are doing it tough,” he said."

        "content": "Royal Mail has said it had its best Christmas for four years, with nearly all festive deliveries arriving on time – despite missing a target that would have handed postal workers a £500 bonus. The delivery company’s owner, International Distributions Services (IDS), on Thursday reported group revenues rose nearly 10% to £3.6bn in the final three months of 2023. It said more than 99% of first- and second-class items that were posted by the last recommended posting date were delivered in time for Christmas.   Related: Dead letter office? Royal Mail wrestles with a difficult future    However, the Observer revealed this month that targets that would have paid out a £500 bonus to employees were missed over the period. In November, the company announced a “one-off quality incentive scheme” to try to avoid a repeat of Christmas 2022, when days of strikes disrupted deliveries. Some its 128,000 employees could have earned up to £500 extra for “hitting local and national quality targets”. However, the national element of the target was missed, limiting the payout to a maximum of £250. It is understood that staff at about 1,000 delivery offices received some of the bonus. IDS said it expected to make an operating profit in the second half of the financial year that would “broadly offset” the £169m loss in the first half. Investors reacted positively, with shares rising by more than 2% at one point on Thursday. Total parcel volumes increased 21% during the quarter, compared with a strike-hit period the previous year. This was helped by the return of some big retail customers – as well as small and medium-sized businesses – using the company to handle products. Christmas represented a brighter end to a year in which , Simon Thompson, departed as chief executive after just two years after the conclusion of a long-running industrial dispute,the company was hit by a ransomware attack and was fined £5.6m for missing targets for punctual deliveries of letters. The IDS chief executive, Martin Seidenberg, who also direct responsibility for Royal Mail as it searches for a chief executive, said the “extraordinary efforts” of its employees “led to a marked improvement in both trading and operational performance for Royal Mail over Christmas and we have continued to win-back customers. We need to build on this momentum”. The company said letter volumes were down 31% on pre-pandemic levels. Revenues from letters rose 11.8% because of rising stamp prices, but it said inflation and pay awards had pushed up costs. Seidenberg repeated his calls for a reform of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver nationally at a fixed price, six days a week. The communications industry regulator Ofcom is expected to publish options for the future of the USO this month. Sources have said Ofcom has conducted analysis and consulted Royal Mail’s customers on how cutting back on delivery days would affect households, including studying the impact of a three-day-a-week service, or alternate-day deliveries. “We are doing all we can to transform, but it is simply not sustainable to maintain a delivery network built for 20bn letters when we are now only delivering 7bn,” Seidenberg said. He made similar comments in a letter to Liam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade select committee, published this week. “Delivering the current universal service requirements – in a financially sustainable way – is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve as the mix and number of parcels and letters changes,” Seidenberg wrote. IDS also announced the appointment of the former Boots, Tesco and Sainsbury’s executive Michael Snape as finance chief, replacing Mick Jeavons."

        "content": "Ticket touts acting out of “greed and dishonesty” sold tickets worth £6.5m to music fans, a court has heard, as a woman known as the “Ticket Queen” pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading nearly seven years after being named in an Observer investigation. TQ Tickets Ltd, owned by Maria Chenery-Woods of Norfolk, used fake identities to hoover up large numbers of tickets for acts such as Ed Sheeran and Little Mix, prosecutors for National Trading Standards said. The touts then “exploited the love and passion” of genuine music fans by reselling through secondary ticketing websites, including Viagogo, StubHub and two now defunct sites owned by Ticketmaster – GetMeIn and Seatwave. Chenery-Woods, 54, and Paul Douglas, 56, who referred to themselves as the Ticket Queen and Ticket Boy respectively, pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading at Leeds crown court. Their respective spouses, Mark Woods, 59, and Lynda Chenery, 51, who is also Chenery-Woods’s sister, have denied the charges and went on trial on Wednesday morning. Opening the case, Jonathan Sandiford KC, prosecuting for National Trading Standards, said: “They were part of a dishonest scheme that, over a number of years, exploited the love and passion that many of us have for our favourite pop bands, our favourite artists – people like Ed Sheeran and so forth.” He said they did this “in order to milk them [fans] for profits”, racking up sales of £6.5m between June 2015 and December 2017 through controversial secondary ticketing platforms, which allow touts to resell tickets for huge mark-ups. They acquired 47,000 tickets during the period using 127 names and 187 different email addresses. Sandiford said the business employed staff, including “corrupted” students, to make multiple applications for event tickets, sometimes using entirely fictional identities and a range of bank and debit cards. He said the actions of the firm included the fraudulent practice of speculatively listing tickets for sale before they had sourced them. This sometimes led to fans being refused entry to venues or saddled with different tickets to those they had paid for. Sandiford referred to practices including “doing a fraudie”, which involved sending customers ripped envelopes to imply that the tickets had been lost in transit, or “using fraud juice”, which involved the use of Tipp-Ex correcting fluid, or more sophisticated digital methods, to amend tickets. Chenery-Woods and her company were first named in an investigation by the Observer in 2016 that revealed how ticket resale sites were dominated by touts. The hearing is the latest in a series of prosecutions against secondary ticketing touts led by investigators at the National Trading Standards e-crime team. In 2020, two touts who made at least £11m selling tickets for concerts by Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift were jailed, after they were found guilty of fraud at the first such trial. The government said last year that it did not think it necessary to change the law to prevent ticket touting, leading to warnings from campaigners that “rampant” resellers would continue to rip people off. Labour is understood to be considering adding legislation to crack down on the practice in its general election manifesto. "

        "content": "Sainsbury’s Bank has opened the door to fresh takeover offers, after the supermarket group announced it would exit the banking business nearly 27 years after its launch. The company is exploring a number of options for its bank – which offers savings accounts, credit cards, travel money and insurance – after a strategic review suggested it could be a distraction from a years-long overhaul, meant to bring the supermarket’s focus back to its core food and retail operations. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have been clear since we launched our Food First strategy in 2020 that we would concentrate our efforts on our core retail businesses and today’s announcement reflects that strategic focus.”   Related: Sexual harassment in City has shifted from office to work trips, MPs told   Sainsbury’s considered selling the bank during the pandemic, but despite interest from companies such as NatWest Group, failed to strike a deal. It is now understood to be open to new bids, though a spokesperson would not comment on whether talks with potential buyers were under way. Sainsbury’s Bank has already exited the mortgage market, having closed to new home loan deals in 2019 and sold its £479m mortgage book – and transferred its 3,500 loan customers – for an undisclosed sum to the Co-operative Bank last August. “In order to improve the financial services offered to customers and consistent with the clear focus on our retail businesses, we are exploring a number of options,” Sainsbury’s said on Thursday. If the groupdid continue to offer any financial services in the future, it would do so solely as a distributor, meaning it would offer “white-label” financial products from other banks under the Sainsbury’s brand. It would ensure customers could access credit cards and saving products through the supermarket, but without Sainsbury’s having to carry risks on its own balance sheet. “Over time this will result in a phased withdrawal from our core banking business,” the supermarket group said. If other options fail, the group could end up winding down the business, which was originally launched as a joint venture with Bank of Scotland in 1997, before Sainsbury’s took full ownership in 2014. Sainsbury’s reported an active loan book worth £3.6bn in March last year, before the sale of its mortgage business, when it had about 1.9 million active customers. That is on top of 2.1 million financial services customers served through its Argos brand, which offers products including buy-now-pay-later arrangements. Sainsbury’s Bank also contributed £50m towards shareholder dividends last year.  Sainsbury’s said there would be no immediate changes to its services – which include its 1,350 cash machines and 225 travel money bureaux across the UK – and its announcement was merely a statement of intent. It will continue serving and taking on new customers until bosses decide how to proceed.  In the interim, Sainsbury’s has appointed the former Allied Irish Bank boss Robert Mulhall to run the bank. Mulhall, who has since worked as a consultant and advised on business overhauls, will take up the role in March, as Sainsbury’s Bank chief executive Jim Brown prepared to retire after more than four years in the role. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s announced that its head of non-food, Paula Nickolds, was leaving to become the boss of the upmarket clothing and homewares brand The White Company in April. The former boss of John Lewis, who has been at Sainsbury’s for almost three years, is taking over from Mary Homer, who has run The White Company for seven years. Sainsbury’s is downsizing its executive team on Nickolds’s exit, with the transformation director, Graham Biggart, having his remit widened to include non-food to. Biggart takes over after a relatively tough Christmas for Sainsbury’s general merchandise aisles and Argos chain, with sales down almost 4% as customers reined in spending on electrical gadgets. Clothing sales were down 6% over the festive period amid mild weather and heavy discounting across the market."

        "content": "Australia’s jobless rate held steady in December but employers shed more than 100,000 full-time jobs as the impact of higher interest rates dragged on the economy. The unemployment rate for the month was a seasonally adjusted 3.9%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. That compared with economists’ forecast of 3.9% and the previously reported 3.9% rate for November.   Related: Neither a pandemic nor interest rate rises: can anything dent the Australian housing market? | Greg Jericho   The surprise, though, was the net loss of 65,000 jobs for December, compared with market expectations of an additional 15,000. Full-time jobs dived by 106,600, the most since May 2020 during Covid, according to Bloomberg. Part-time positions only clawed back 41,400 positions. Another surprise was the steep drop in the participation rate, a gauge of the proportion of the population looking for work. That dropped from a revised record 67.3% in November to 66.8%. Hours worked also slid 0.5% for the month.  Interactive  The jobs figures are the first major statistics released for December and offer one indicator of the strength of the economy at the end of last year. The labour market has generally surprised economists for its strength since the Covid disruptions here and in other nations. The Reserve Bank forecast in November that the the jobless rate will drift higher to about 4.25% by the end of 2024. Its board will meet for the first time this year on 5-6 February when it will also release updated economic forecasts. Prior to today’s figures, all of the big four banks were forecasting the RBA wouldn’t need to add to its 13 interest rate rises since May 2022. A first rate cut should arrive by the second half of this year.  With NAB now ditching its forecast for an RBA rate rise next month, all of big four banks tip the next move will be a cut. CBA, the biggest mortgage issuer, predicts the most cuts this year, with three reductions to end 2024. (Source: @RateCity ) pic.twitter.com/2ZW9C4fK43— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) January 17, 2024  The ABS said last month’s poor results followed a better performance in the previous two. “The fall in employment in December followed larger than usual employment growth in October and November, a combined increase of 117,000 people, with the employment-to-population ratio and participation rate both at record highs in November,” said David Taylor, ABS’s head of labour statistics. “While the December employment fall was large, the number of employed people was still 52,000 higher than September,” he said. “Looking over the past twelve months, seasonally adjusted employment increased by an average of 32,000 people per month, showing reasonably strong underlying growth during 2023.” Hours worked had been dropping through the second half of last year and were now back to the levels of last February, Taylor said. Ben Udy, lead economist for Oxford Economics Australia, said that “[w]hile we’re always cautious to avoid reading too much into a single monthly data point, the deterioration in the labour market is clearly in full swing”. “We expect this softening to continue in 2024 and forecast the unemployment rate to approach 4.5% by the end of this year,” Udy said. David Bassanese, chief economist for BetaShares, said the sharp drop in employment last month “should be taken with a grain of salt given the volatility in the jobs numbers over recent months”. “Any upward drift in the unemployment rate over 2024 will give the RBA more room to move in terms of rate cuts over the year,” Bassanese said. Across the states, NSW continued to have the lowest jobless rate at 3.4%, unchanged from November. Victoria’s rate was also unchanged at 4% while Queensland’s improved to 4.3% from 4.4%. The ACT and WA were two regions to see the rate tick higher, coming in at 3.9% for both. The ABS noted floods and storms in parts of Queensland had made it harder to gather data for that state. Still, it deemed the figures were “fit for publication without any need for imputation” but was open to undertaking “additional analysis of the collected data to ensure the quality of final estimates”. Market reaction was limited. The Aussie dollar initially dropped about 0.1 US cent but remained at about 65.5 US cents, while the stock market modestly pared its losses for the day."

        "content": "The social change sparked by the #MeToo movement has not translated to the UK’s financial sector, with sexual harassment merely shifting away from the office to conferences and work trips, MPs have heard.  A summary of private hearings held as part of the Treasury committee’s sexism in the City inquiry showed that, while a small number of women said workplaces had become more inclusive in recent years, the majority felt the Square Mile was still an “old boys’ club” with widespread misconduct and misogyny. The women who gave evidence to MPs said that sexist “banter” had reduced, but that misogynistic attitudes remained “widespread” and behaviour had instead become “more underhand and pernicious”. The Treasury committee was left with the impression that the #MeToo movement had failed to influence change across City firms. Most women who appeared before the hearing in November said that sexual harassment remained commonplace, having either directly experienced harassment or knowing colleagues who had. The movement gathered pace in 2017 as women in all industries across the world began sharing personal stories of sexual harassment on social media. In the committee’s evidence, the women interviewed said the big difference since then was that perpetrators were targeting women outside the office, including at conferences and drinks events, or while on work trips. The Prudential Regulation Authority boss, Sam Woods, told MPs on Wednesday that it was “very disturbing to see that those sorts of things are still occurring in the sector that we all work in”. The committee member and Labour MP Angela Eagle told City regulators that there had been “a lot of buck-passing” and “box-ticking” but precious little progress in making the workplace a safer place for women. But when asked what more could be done to keep “bad apples” out of the City , the Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, said a lack of a set list of non-financial offences that would automatically disqualify an individual from working in the City – which required legislation – had made it difficult to ban even convicted child groomers from the sector. Rathi was referring to a 2021 case in which FCA’s upper tribunal said one man’s conviction over child sexual grooming was not enough to automatically prohibit him from employment in finance. “It means that we have to, in each case, demonstrate that the conviction or the conduct is sufficiently relevant to the financial services role that they are performing.” Male colleagues who witnessed inappropriate behaviour were often privately supportive of victims but would rarely call it out, or take steps to intervene. They only helped victims avoid those known to act badly, rather than tackling the behaviour head on, the interviewees said. Women also said they thought that non-disclosure agreements – or gagging orders – were still widely being used to make problems “go away” and to avoid damaging firms’ reputations. It had the effect of silencing victims, ensuring that they could not share their experiences, and ultimately removing an incentive for firms to take action to prevent sexual harassment. And while there had been a drop in overt sexism in the workplace, including sexist “office banter”, women thought that misogynistic mindsets were still widespread, but that behaviour had instead become “more underhand and pernicious”, the committee said. Although some said younger male colleagues were often more supportive, they quickly began to emulate the behaviour of older, more senior staff. That included participating in a drinking culture, which often put pressure on non-drinkers to take part. However, this was also the kind of event where the worst behaviour towards women was reported. The women who shared their experience put forward recommendations to tackle continuing sexism, including making sure pay and bonuses were more closely tied to diversity and inclusion efforts, and requiring firms to report the number of gagging orders used in sexual misconduct cases. They also called for credible threats or fines and penalties for perpetrators or those condoning sexual misconduct, as well as ensuring that regulators reviewed sexual misconduct when determining whether employees were “fit and proper” to take senior roles. FCA bosses confirmed on Wednesday that it was still legal for victims to call the regulator’s whistleblowing hotline to disclose misconduct, even after they signed an NDA. "

        "published_date": "2024-01-17T18:37:10+00:00",
        "content": "UK inflation rose unexpectedly to 4.0% in December in the first increase for 10 months, complicating the timing of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England this year. Shares on the FTSE 100 slumped 1.5% to register the worst daily fall since last August as investors bet that interest rates would be cut more slowly this year by the Bank of England than previously forecast. The price of Brent crude dipped more than 2% before a modest recovery to $77 a barrel with oil traders blaming the downturn on figures showing that China, the world’s largest consumer of oil, food and metals, grew more slowly than expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. Investors have poured funds into company stocks in the expectation of an economic recovery fostered by cuts in the cost of borrowing from the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. Warnings from officials at the European Central Bank that interest rates would need to remain high for much of the year to bring down inflation across the 20-member eurozone were another trigger for the broad-based sell-off in stocks. The Office for National Statistics said the UK’s annual inflation - as measured by the consumer prices index - went up from the 3.9% reading in November, confounding City economists’ forecasts of a modest decline to 3.8%. Financial markets pared back expectations for a first cut to come in May, with June now seen as more likely, while also betting on a smaller reduction in borrowing costs by the end of the year from about 1.24 percentage points before the data to about 1.12 percentage points. The increase in the annual rate was largely the result of increases in the cost of tobacco – after the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced higher duty in the autumn statement – and alcohol.   Related: UK inflation rise complicates outlook on interest rates   Tobacco prices increased by 16% on the year while alcohol was up 9.6%, as the cost of buying cigarettes and drink contributed the most to inflation since 2006. Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said the tobacco and alcohol rises “were offset partially by falling food inflation, where prices still rose but at a much lower rate than this time last year. Meanwhile, the prices of goods leaving factories are little changed over the last few months, while the costs of raw materials remain lower than a year ago.” Core inflation, which excludes volatile items including energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, was unexpectedly unchanged at 5.1%, in a development that will be watched closely by the Bank before its next rate decision on 1 February. Services inflation increased slightly from 6.1% to 6.2%. Motor fuel prices fell by 10.8% in the year to December, compared with a decline of 10.6% in the year to November, after a drop of about 8p a litre for petrol and diesel on the month. The December figures will be used by some of Britain’s largest mobile phone and broadband operators to increase prices this spring, months before a ban from the telecoms regulator Ofcom on firms imposing inflation-linked rises in the middle of a contract. With most operators adding 3.9 percentage points on top of inflation, consumers face an increase of nearly 8%.  Despite the small increase in the headline rate, inflation has fallen back by more than Threadneedle Street was expecting in November. Economists said it was probably still on track to drop below the Bank’s 2% target by the spring, but warned against expectations for a smooth decline. Inflation figures for January published next month will take into account the 5% rise in the Ofgem energy price cap in Great Britain, with potential to drive up the headline rate. City economists expect the cap to fall by about 10% in April amid a wider decline in wholesale prices, helping to bring down overall inflation. However, concerns are mounting over the impact from geopolitical tensions and disruption to shipping in the Red Sea. Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at the analysts Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “There are likely to be more knocks on the way, with conflict in the Red Sea raising the risk of supply shortages, which could feed into higher prices. There’s the risk this could end up throwing a real spanner in the works.” Inflation hitting 4% in December does, however, enable Rishi Sunak to declare victory on his top economic priority for 2023, after he promised last January to halve the rate by the end of the year at a time when it was above 10%. Most economists had expected it to drop by this much anyway, but inflation has proved more persistent than first anticipated. Eurozone inflation rose to 2.9% in December, while US inflation increased to 3.4%. Hunt, said: “As we have seen in the US, France and Germany, inflation does not fall in a straight line, but our plan is working and we should stick to it. We took difficult decisions to control borrowing and are now turning a corner, so we need to stay the course we have set out, including boosting growth with more competitive tax levels.” Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “Prices are still rising in the shops, with the average weekly shop £110 more than it was before the last general election, and the average family set to be £1,200 worse off under Rishi Sunak’s tax plan.”"

        "content": "Britain is ramping up pressure on western governments to use $350bn (£275bn) of frozen Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine’s war-shattered economy, with David Cameron insisting there were legal, moral and political justifications for action. The foreign secretary said the countries that were backing Ukraine had economies that when combined were 25 times the size of Russia and it was important to make that firepower count. Speaking in Davos, where Ukraine has been high on the agenda at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Lord Cameron said: “When Putin launched this illegal invasion, the world changed, and we have to change with it and recognise we are in a more dangerous, uncertain and difficult world. “We should be prepared to do some innovative thinking about how we use these resources to help Ukraine.” The rich G7 countries froze Russian central bank reserves after the invasion of February 2022, and there have been growing demands from Kyiv for the assets to be seized and spent on reconstruction. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s chief economist Beata Javorcik said without continuing flows of financial support from overseas there was a chance that Ukraine’s government would have to print money to pay its bills. “We don’t want a failed state,” she said. Cameron said the moral argument was straightforward and strong. “At the end of the day, Russia is going to have to pay reparations for its illegal invasion, so why not spend some of the money now, rather than wait till the war is over and have all the legal wrangling about reparations”. The foreign secretary brushed aside concerns that it could change the way people see financial centres operating, and trigger an exodus of national reserves from western banks. Cameron said he was working very hard on the issue, as is the rest of the G7, and he was confident of progress. Bill Browder, CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and longstanding Kremlin critic, said the possibility of Donald Trump winning the next US presidential election should spur policymakers to move speedily. “Donald Trump has said he is going to solve the Ukraine crisis in one day,” Browder told an event at Ukraine House in Davos on Wednesday. “What does that mean? He is going to cut off Ukraine from funding. “I would argue, putting aside all these niceties, that confiscating the $350bn is Donald Trump insurance,” Browder added. “It needs to be done before the US election, so that if that were to come to pass, Ukraine can carry on defending itself and win.”"

        "title": "Give BP’s ‘continuity candidate’ time to succeed or fail on net zero strategy  | Nils Pratley",

        "content": "After a “robust and competitive” hunt for a new chief executive, the board of BP has decided that the best appointment is the bloke who has been sitting in the boardroom for three and a half years already and doing the job on a stand-in basis since the defenestration of Bernard Looney last September. No surprise there. BP has never appointed a boss from outside, and Murray Auchincloss, the former chief financial officer, fits the bill as a continuity candidate. He has been in the company for 25 years and is wedded to Looney’s – and chair Helge Lund’s – strategy of “orderly” transition to net zero by 2050 or sooner. He did the numbers on the approach, after all. Continuity won’t be everybody’s cup of tea, however. Some investors will hate it. They are the ones who don’t sign climate activist resolutions and don’t buy the idea that BP’s “transition growth engines” – wind turbines, hydrogen, biofuels and electric vehicle (EV) charging points – can ever generate the same returns on capital as fossil fuels. They would rather oil companies stick to producing oil and gas (and ramping up the dividends and share buybacks) while leaving the transitioning stuff to specialists. On Looney’s watch, BP’s shares persistently traded at a discount within the Big Oil club. In a post-Covid world of higher oil prices, the very oily and cash-generative Americans, Chevron and Exxon, sit atop the valuation charts. Versus Shell, which last year abandoned plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade, BP also stands at a discount. Looney’s own tweak was to lower BP’s target for a cut in hydrocarbon production from 40% to 25% by 2030, but it didn’t close the valuation gap. What is Auchincloss to do? Well, one hopes he does what he says and sticks to the plan. Somebody within oil’s old guard has to try to demonstrate that it is possible to generate the same returns in energy outside fossil fuels. BP’s pledge is that biofuels (gas and liquid) and EV charging points can produce an oil-like 15% over the cycle. If that was achieved, some of the doubts would fade. Half the problem, though, is long lead times. BP’s transition assets are likely to produce top-line earnings of only $1.5bn this year, which barely moves the dial at a company of its size. It is only by 2030, when the relevant earnings are scheduled to be $10bn, that doubters may have started to rethink. The only sure answer is to hit every target on the way and avoid obvious financial duds, such as wind in the US. Looking through the other end of the transition telescope, one could equally say that the pace of change at BP is sluggish. That is also true; fossil fuels are still projected to be 75% of the group’s earnings by 2030. But, within a deeply divided investor base, Auchincloss will primarily feel the heat from those who would be oily for longer. That’s life, unfortunately. But continuity, however dull it sounds, is a reasonable stance for BP’s under-pressure board to take at this point. The current strategy is three years old, which is no time in the energy business. It should be given a chance to succeed or fail."

        "title": "Tata Steel to confirm shutdown of Port Talbot blast furnaces, sources claim",
        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-17T18:12:49+00:00",
        "content": "Concern is mounting that Tata Steel will confirm plans to shut down much of its production at the Port Talbot steelworks during a crunch meeting with trade unions, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Three sources said they believed that Tata Steel Europe, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, was on the brink of confirming plans to close Port Talbot’s two blast furnaces, ending more than a century of making steel from scratch in south Wales. Tata was expected to say in November that it would deactivate the steelmaking operation, while it spends four years building electric arc furnaces, a greener, cheaper electric alternative. But at the last minute the company postponed official confirmation of the closures, which unions say could cost 3,000 jobs directly, and hundreds more in the wider community. Port Talbot employs about 4,000 workers. Trade unions representing steelworkers, led by the GMB, Community and Unite, have since put forward separate proposals to keep the plant operating during the transition. But two industry sources said they feared Tata could push ahead with its original proposals and might confirm its intentions at a meeting of the UK steel committee, which includes the company and unions. At the meeting, held at noon on Thursday in London, the company is expected to say it cannot afford a proposal drawn up on behalf of the GMB and Community unions by the consultancy Syndex. That plan would protect 2,000 jobs and keep the blast furnaces open during the four-year transition period, with at least one continuing to run hot until 2032. An industry source said this would cost Tata Steel Europe more than £1bn during the transition to greener production, based on the UK operation losing £1m a day. A senior Westminster source said they believed “something bad” was coming this week for the future of Port Talbot. Any plans involving job losses would be particularly controversial politically, given the construction of Tata’s electric arc furnaces, which make steel from scrap rather than raw materials, is to be funded by £500m of taxpayer subsidy alongside the company’s own £750m investment.   Related: ‘A golden opportunity’: Port Talbot fights to keep its steelmaking tradition alive   A Tata spokesperson declined to comment on what it would say on Thursday, instead reissuing an earlier statement. “We have recently announced a joint agreement between Tata Steel and UK government for a proposal to invest in state-of-the art electric arc furnace steelmaking in Port Talbot,” the spokesperson said. “We are committed to meaningful information sharing and consultation with our trade union partners about the plan to develop sustainable steelmaking in the UK and to find solutions for concerns they may have. While those discussions are ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further.” Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot steelworks, said: “Steel is critical for our national security, good local jobs, and for the transition to a greener economy – and we need our steel to be made here in the UK, otherwise we become reliant on imports controlled by hostile regimes. “That’s why the Tata-Tory ‘bad deal for steel’ is such an affront to all those who understand the steel industry – because it will limit the quality and quantity of steel we can make in Port Talbot, and in doing so cost thousands of jobs.” If both blast furnaces are turned off, activities such as rolling of imported steel slab or coil could continue. But pausing production would send a grim signal for British steelmaking, in a crunch year for the sector, which is at a “crossroads” from which it will either thrive or continue in managed decline, say industry figures. In Scunthorpe, the UK’s only other blast furnace site, the owner of British Steel, the Chinese industrials company Jingye, is planning a similar £1.25bn conversion to electric arc furnaces that has raised separate questions over the future of about 2,000 workers. When Jingye rescued British Steel in 2020, it promised a “new chapter” in UK steelmaking. It, too, is expected to ask for £500m in government support for its plans. Should both Scunthorpe and Port Talbot close down their blast furnaces, the UK would be the only economy in the G20 with no ability to make steel from scratch, a process that produces high quality steel grades for specific uses. In the meantime, Britain would rely on imported steel for the aerospace and automotive sectors and to make hundreds of miles of railway track. Buyers of Port Talbot steel, such as Nissan’s Sunderland automotive factory, and canning producers such as the baked bean maker Heinz, would have to look elsewhere for steel. In the long term, electric arc furnaces can replicate some of these higher grades but it is much more difficult to do so and requires very high quality scrap. The sector has complained bitterly about sky-high energy costs, which far exceed the prices paid by European rivals in an extremely energy-intensive sector. Rocketing costs have cemented a longer-term decline since 1971, when the UK produced 25m tonnes of steel compared with about 6m tonnes today. The decline has meant a fall in jobs too, from more than 250,000 to just under 34,000. • This article was amended on 18 January 2024. A previous version incorrectly said that Tata was owned by the Ruia brothers. In fact, the company is controlled by trusts set up by the Tata family."

Traditional Keynesian demand management was not possible.\n\n“We face different constraints. Fiscal headroom is limited. We have to do things differently.”\n\nIn the UK, Reeves said economic policy could not just about spending money. “We don’t have that luxury”.\nInstead as chancellor she would be focussing on planning reform, increasing work force participation and unlocking pension funds for investment.\n\n\n\n 4.47pm GMT \n\n\n\nMacron at Davos: For Russia not to win in Ukraine, 2024 will be key year for Europeans, whatever outcome U.S. elections— CGTN America (@cgtnamerica) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.47pm GMT \n\nRussia cannot and will not win in Ukraine, Macron declares to delegates in Davos.\n\n\n\n 4.46pm GMT \nMacron: 2024 will be a truly French vintage of a year\n\nRather endearingly, Macron concedes that he is blowing his own whistle, as he tells that 2024 will be a truly French vintage of a year.\nHe says he hopes many people will come to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in June.\nThe Paris Olympics this summer will be a cultural and sporting event for us, the French president continues.\nPlus, he adds, Notre-Dame Cathedral will reopen this year, after the terrible fire of 2019.\n\nUpdated at 4.48pm GMT\n\n\n 4.42pm GMT \n\nAfter Javier Milei’s full-blooded defence of free market capitalism, red in tooth and claw, Davos will now hear from France’s Emmanual Macron.\nWEF founder Klaus Schwab doesn’t hold back with his introduction, hailing Macron as a daring reformer who has taken on the biggest challenges of our times.\nMacron is now running through the many achievements of his administration, citing (among other things) progress on green technology, investment in education, and an ambitious European strategy.\nMacron says Europe is criticised, but has made big progress, such as facing the Ukraine crisis united.\nOn economics, he says France has created two million jobs in the last six years, and opened hundreds of factories.\nOn electric cars, Macron points out that France already has four gigafactories, which will help speed up its EV car production.\nAnd putting modestly firmly to one side, Macron declares:\n\nWe are European leaders in quantum, in AI. We have fantastic talents of which the world is envious.\n\nAll advanced economies must work to create jobs and reindustrialise, with a focus on green technology and addressing climate change, Macron says.\nHe says we have seen how dependence makes things complicated, both in the Covid crisis and also Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 4.31pm GMT \nBill Browder: Using Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine is 'Donald Trump insurance'\n\nDonald Trump is the spectre at the feast of Davos this year, especially after his landslide win in Iowa earlier this week.\nAnd Bill Browder, CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and long-standing Kremlin critic, said today that the possibility of Trump returning to the White House should spur policymakers to use seized Russian assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine this year.\nSpeaking at an event at Ukraine House here in Davos this afternoon, Browder says:\n\nDonald Trump has said he is going to solve the Ukraine crisis in one day. What does that mean? He is going to cut off Ukraine from funding. \nI would argue, putting aside all these niceties, that confiscating the $350bn is Donald Trump insurance. It needs to be done before the US election, so that if that were to come to pass, Ukraine can carry on defending itself and win.”\n\nBrowder added:\n\n“It is the right thing to do morally, politically, and financially… I don’t think it can be done unless everyone does it together.”\n\n\n\n\n 4.19pm GMT \nBloomberg: Blinken stranded after Boeing plane breaks down on Davos trip\n\nOh goodness me.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was unable to fly home from Davos as scheduled today due to a critical error with his aircraft, Bloomberg reports.\nThey say:\n\nAfter flying from Davos on helicopters and boarding the modified Boeing 737, Blinken and his party were informed that the aircraft had been deemed unsafe to fly. An oxygen leak detected previously could not be remedied.\nA smaller jet was being flown to Zurich from Brussels to ferry home the top US diplomat, while many of his aides and members of the press pool had to travel to Washington commercially.\n\n\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was unable to fly home from Davos as scheduled on Wednesday due to a critical error with his aircraft https://t.co/KIOsXkcFr2— Bloomberg (@business) January 17, 2024\n\n\nAs well as being inconvenient for Blinken and his team, it could be a massive embarrassment for Boeing, which is already reeling from concerns about its 737 Max 9, after a piece of fuselage fell off mid-flight.\n\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was unable to fly home from Davos as scheduled on Wednesday due to a critical error with his aircraft https://t.co/KIOsXkcFr2— Bloomberg (@business) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.20pm GMT\n\n\n 3.37pm GMT \nMilei: Long live freedom, dammit\n\nSumming up, Javier Milie again criticises the failing Western system, saying it leads to unwelcome interventions such as subsidies and price controls, which hinder the free work of markets.\nAnd in conclusion, he praises business people in the audience, and beyond, in a crescendo, telling them:\n\nDo not be intimidated, either by the political class or by parasites who live off the state.\nDo not surrender to a political class that only wants to stay in power and retain its priviliges.\nYou are social benefactors. You’re heroes, You’re the creators of the most extraordinary period of prosperity we’ve ever seen.\n\nIf you make money it’s because you make a better product at a better price, Milei insists, declaring:\n\nThe state is not the solution, the state is the problem.\n\nFrom today, Argentina is your “staunch , unconditional ally”, he pledges.\nAnd in a memorable mike-drop, Milei declares:\n\nThank you very much, and long live freedom, dammit.\n\nAnd with that, he’s off the stage. No opportunity for questions, alas (although where to begin?…..)\n\nUpdated at 4.11pm GMT\n\n\n 3.24pm GMT \n\nHaving taken a mighty swing at western economic values, Javier Milei then turns to feminism.\nHe tells Davos that libertarianism states that we all have inalienable rights.\nThe “radical feminist agenda” has led to greater state intervention, Milei lectures WEF, citing ministries of women or international organisations dedicated to this agenda.\n[Milei doesn’t explain, though, how this libertarian vision accounts for UK women effectively working two months for free due to the gender pay gap, for example]\n\n\n\n 3.18pm GMT \n\nMilei goes on to attack social justice, saying that it is not just – instead, it is intrinsically unfair because it is violent.\nThis violence, he says, is because taxes are collected coercively.\nThus the state is financed through coercion, Milei says. And by this logic, the higher the tax burden, the higher the coercion and the lower the freedom.\nMilei adds that it isn’t a given that there is a pie of wealth to be carved up.\n\n\n\n 3.17pm GMT \n\nTurning to economic theory, Milei says that the market is not merely a graph showing supply and demand, but actually a market for social cooperation.\nHe argues that the dilemma faced by neoclassical economies is that they want to tackle problems in the market by stopping market failures.\nBut tackling market failures, perhaps through regulation or subsidies, you are opening up the way to socialism.\nIn Milei’s libertarian book, state intervention is harmful.\n\n\n\n 3.13pm GMT \n\nSocialism is always, everywhere, an impoverishering phenomonen everywhere it has been tried, Javier Milei insist.\nIt has also murdered 100 million people, he adds.\n[this is a claim that communism was the leading ideological cause of death between 1900 and 2000, with 94m perishing in China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Eastern Europe].\n\n\n\n 3.04pm GMT \n\nMilei goes on to attack collectivism, saying it binds the hands of entrepeneurs.\nHe rattles through a flurry of economic statistics, saying that between 0AD and 1800AD, global GDP per capita stagnated, apart from a pick-up after discovery of America.\nGDP per capita only rose by 0.02% annually, he says, so almost no growth.\nIn the 19th century, in the industrial revolution, the compound annual growth rate was 0.66%, so would need over 100 years to double.\nBut this rate has picked up, so that in 2000-2023, the growth rate then accelerated to 3% per year, so can double in 23 years.\n\n\n\n 2.57pm GMT \nArgentina's Milei: The western world is in danger\n\nNext up, on a busy day in Davos, is Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei, who is giving a special address.\nThis could be interesting… Milei flew by commercial jet to the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday, taking selfies with passengers on board and criticizing what he called the event’s “socialist agenda”.\nKlaus Schwab introduces Milei, congratulating him on his victory in the presidential election. This is your first foreign trip since, he points out.\nSchwab, who has a dab hand introducing world leaders, says Milei’s “more radical methods” have “introduced a new spirit to Argentina”.\nMilei then takes the microphone.\nAnd he warns that “the Western world is in danger”, declaring:\n\nThose who are meant to defend the values of the west have been co-opted by a vision of the world that inexoriably leads to socialism, and therefore poverty.\n\nThe main leaders of Western countries have abandoned freedom, in favour of collectivism, Milei claims.\nThese are not the solution to the world’s problems, he says, but the root cause.\nFree market capitalism is the only way to tackle poverty, and the only morally desirable solution, he argues.\n\nUpdated at 9.33am GMT\n\n\n 2.44pm GMT \nUNDP chief: More countries in debt distress, and possible default\n\nThe prospect of lower interest rates is bringing no relief to heavily indebted problems of the world’s poor countries, according to Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN development Programme (UNDP).\nSteiner said in an interview here in Davos that:\n\n“More countries are finding themselves in the realms of debt distress and possible default.”\n\nLast month the World Bank said rising borrowing costs had pushed annual debt repayments to a record $443.5bn in 2022 and Steiner said this was having a profound impact on the ability of poor countries to grow sustainably.\n“Countries are being left to fend for themselves or face choices that are brutal” Steiner said, adding:\n\n“They are not able to pursue the development strategies they want but instead are going for whatever growth they can get”.\n\nHe continued: \n\n“Debt repayments mean they don’t have the money to invest in the energy transition, educating their children, and building more resilience in health systems.”\n\n\n\n\n 1.57pm GMT \n\nDavid Cameron can’t escape his responsibility for Britain’s exit from the European Union at Davos today.\nAt the end of his session on supporting Ukraine, the foreign secretary is asked.\nQ: You talked about the strength of the UK economy – doesn’t that show you were wrong to worry that Brexit would damage growth? Hasn’t Brexit been a big success?\nLord Cameron says the country made its choice in 2016 – now politicians must make it work.\nHe says Britain is demonstrating that it is perfectly capable of building a relationship where we are friends, neighbors and partners with the EU, and making it work.\nHe cites the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an example.\n[On the growth point, the UK is currently on the brink of a technical recession, having contracted slightly in July-September].\n\nUpdated at 2.21pm GMT\n\n\n 1.52pm GMT \nCameron: confident Rwanda bill will pass tonight\n\nQ: Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame has said today [to the Guardian] there are limits for how long this can go on? Are you worried the deal could collapse?\nDavid Cameron replies that he is confident the Rwanda bill will be passed tonight, when it has its third reading in the House of Commons.\n[reminder: last night, two Conservative party deputy chairs resigned after defying Rishi Sunak and backing rightwing challenges to harden up his Rwanda deportation bill].\nHe says:\n\n“We have signed this new treaty with Rwanda which puts beyond doubt that there are no dangers of asylum seekers being sent back to the country from which they came if they genuinely are asylum seekers....

The Green Party has a clear message for the World Economic Forum: we are proud to be the Party willing to tackle inequality and implement the policies needed to create a fairer greener planet.

That has become ever more acute in recent days and weeks as we see wars and conflict in Europe and the Middle East.\n “These conflicts are happening thousands of miles away from Britain’s shores. However, they are having a very real impact closer to home, with rising energy bills, higher prices in the shops and businesses anxious about disruptions to global trade.\n“All major economies are being impacted by these global shocks, but Britain has been uniquely exposed. Fourteen years of stagnant economic growth and political uncertainty has left Britain weaker: the chaotic departure from the European Union, the turmoil under Liz Truss and now the managed decline with Rishi Sunak.

        "content": "Just in case you were ever worried that the Australian housing market might crumble, the latest ABS housing loan figures show that in November the value of new housing finance was 13% above that of a year earlier. And because of the strong link between growth loans and house prices, this suggests that house prices should continue to rise very solidly through the next six months:    If the graph does not display please click here It’s quite amazing how nothing – not a pandemic, not rising interest rates – seems to do much to dampen the housing market. Amazing, that is, unless you forget that the entire focus of political pressure over the past 40 years or so has been designed to keep house prices from falling, or even abating. Given that, it is little wonder that Australians continue to think buying a house is a good financial decision and the cost of loans continues to rise:    If graph does not display please click here Average mortgages over the past two years have been relatively flat but that came in the time that rates rose faster than they have in 30 years, and after the absurd price growth in 2020 and 2021. And even then the flatness mostly occurred in New South Wales and Victoria, while Queensland and South Australia especially have seen little sign of a pause:    If the graph does not display please click here It says something that rising interest rates by 425 basis points only served to dampen house price growth but not really lower them. And that dampening should now be over.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The latest figures are from November – the last month in which the RBA raised rates. And since then, the outlook has changed rather dramatically. Just before the last increase, the market was expecting that the Reserve Bank would raise rates but only some time early this year. Investors then predicted that by early next year the RBA might be a chance to cut the cash rate back to 4.1%. Now investors believe the RBA will cut rates to that level by August with another cut before the end of the year and another one in the first half of 2025:    If the graph does not display please click here This would of course be very pleasing news for homeowners given since the increase in rates there has been a big shift in the number of people taking out fixed-rate loans.    If the graph does not display please click here Australians, unlike Americans, have always preferred variable home loans. Generally, about 85% or so of home loans would be variable. Early in the pandemic, as rates crashed to record lows, more people locked in those rates. But as rates have risen, the number of people taking out fixed-rate loans has plummeted. Last November only 2% of all new home loans were fixed rates. That means almost all new homeowners would benefit from lower rates. Of course, before breaking out the champagne, it is worth wondering why the market expects the RBA to cut the cash rate.   Related: Renters know they are the losers in Australia’s housing system – and as their anger rises, so will their protest vote | Emma Dawson   Central banks don’t cut interest rates because they think people deserve to pay lower interest rates, they do so because of the effect they think it will have on the economy. If we wish to view the glass as half-full, the RBA would cut rates because it believes the current rate is slightly above a “neutral” setting – a point at which rates are neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth. Most homeowners would think “slightly above” is rather a stretch given since the end of 2020 the monthly repayments on an average new loan have risen about 55% while over the same period wages have risen only about 8%:    If the graph does not display please click here But as inflation returns to normal levels of about 3% the RBA would naturally think it is time to return raters to that “neutral rate” or about 3.8% – ie around two rate cuts’ worth. By contrast, the glass half-empty view is that the RBA will need to cut rates because the economy slows by more than it hoped and unemployment is rising faster than it expected and so it is cutting rates to give the economy a boost. Either way, it does appear the peak of interest rates has been reached. That will be good news for the government and homeowner, less so for those who were unable to afford a house even with the recent “flatness” of price growth. Should prices once again take off faster than incomes, we may very well look back to now as the good times for housing affordability.

        "content": "Workers who make Bud Light and other top-selling beers are threatening to strike in demand of significant wage increases, job security and improvements to retirement and benefits in the first big union contract battle of 2024. Five thousand workers, represented by the Teamsters at 12 Anheuser-Busch breweries in the US, are threatening to strike after voting 99% in favor of a strike authorization last month. Their current union contract is set to expire on 29 February. “Without a contract by February 29, there won’t be any beer come March,” the Teamsters warned on X.   Related: UAW announces union campaign at Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama   The contract fight is the first at Anheuser-Busch with the Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien, at the helm of the union. Elected in 2022, O’Brien led the union in securing record contract gain at UPS last year amid threats of a massive strike. “If Anheuser-Busch’s executives can’t get their act together to negotiate an agreement that respects workers, we will see them out on the streets,” O’Brien said in a statement on the strike vote. According to the Teamsters, the union hasn’t met with Anheuser-Busch since 16 November, when the company refused to negotiate on job security. Anntonette Norris, who has worked at the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Jacksonville, Florida, for 25 years, said workers were due for a substantial wage increase in the new contract as wages have lagged behind inflation and price increases. “When I started, Anheuser-Busch was what you would consider the top dog, it was the job to have. The pay was great, but with inflation, we are not the top-paying job,” she said. Norris said her brother had started working at Anheuser-Busch in the last five years. “Things that would have been easily attainable to me when I started, are not that for him now,” said Norris. “With the increases of prices for everything, people are working numerous amounts of overtime to try to make up for the pay we don’t have at this time.” Workers face intense heat during summer weather and intense cold during the winter, said Norris. They sacrifice time away from families to work night shifts and handle dangerous, hi-tech equipment. “It’s a great product to enjoy out in the market, but it’s a big sacrifice to make that product,” Norris added. “Anheuser-Busch wants to be No 1 in the beer industry, then they should want the No 1 group of employees working for them, who are proud to work for them and who are being compensated like it. We just want a fair and great contract that we feel that we are long overdue for.” Anheuser-Busch brews some of the best-selling beer products on the US market, including Budweiser products, Michelob Ultra, Busch and Stella Artois, with US breweries in Baldwinsville, New York; Cartersville, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; Fairfield, California; Fort Collins, Colorado; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Merrimack, New Hampshire; Newark, New Jersey; St. Louis, Missouri, and Williamsburg, Virginia. Parent company AB InBev makes around a quarter of all beer drunk globally and reported profits of over $32bn in fiscal year 2023, a 1.97% increase from 2022. The increase came despite a slump in US sales following a conservative-driven boycott over a social media promotion with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer. The company announced a $1bn stock buyback program in October 2023 over the next year and launched a sponsorship campaign with the UFC in the same month valued at over $100m. Angel Arroyo, 53, has worked at Anheuser-Busch’s brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, for 20 years. He said that wages at the brewery had fallen behind compared with other businesses in the area. “Twenty years ago, Anheuser-Busch was one of the top-paying businesses here in Colorado. Unfortunately, with the concessions we made throughout the years, a two-tier in medical benefits and slight wage increases, we really let Anheuser InBev get a stronghold on the work we’ve accomplished,” said Arroyo. “We’re looking for job security. We’re looking for the American Dream,” he said. “We need to share in our profits and we need to bring up the working class better than it was before.” Arroyo said the 99% strike authorization vote sent a message that workers are sticking together to demand what’s due to them. The last contract reached in 2019 included only $2.50 in wage increases over five years and included higher medical benefit costs for new employees. “Even our younger employees who aren’t so well versed in unions are getting on board. They see what the future holds. They’ve seen their parents struggle and I think now they’re realizing that’s not the life they want,” added Arroyo. A spokesperson for Anheuser-Busch said in response to the strike authorization vote and contract negotiations with the Teamsters: “Anheuser-Busch is aware of the Teamsters’ strike authorization vote, which is common during labor negotiations. We have a long-standing track record of reaching agreements with organized labor and look forward to resuming negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that continues to recognize and reward our employees.”"

        "content": "Big technology companies are recklessly pursuing profits from artificial intelligence and urgent action is needed to mitigate the risks from the rapidly growing sector, the head of the United Nations has warned. In a fierce attack on the technology multinationals, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos that every breakthrough in generative AI increased the threat of unintended consequences. Guterres linked the risks from AI to that posed by the climate crisis and said the international community had no strategy to deal with either.   Related: AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality, says IMF head   Addressing the WEF in the Swiss resort, the UN head challenged representatives of the tech industry in the audience to work with governments to put in place guardrails for AI. “This technology has enormous potential for sustainable development – but the International Monetary Fund has just warned that it is very likely to worsen inequality,” he said, referencing an IMF report published on Monday. “Powerful tech companies are already pursuing profits with a reckless disregard for human rights, personal privacy, and social impact.” Tech companies say they are putting in place systems to prevent AI being used for criminal or other malign purposes, and insist the new technology will create more jobs than it destroys. Guterres said much more needed to be done, arguing that governments and international bodies such as the UN needed to play a role in ensuring AI was a force for good. “My advisory body on AI has already made preliminary recommendations on AI governance that tap the benefits of this incredible new technology, while mitigating its risks,” he said. “We need governments urgently to work with tech companies on risk management frameworks for current AI development; and on monitoring and mitigating future harms. And we need a systematic effort to increase access to AI so that developing economies can benefit from its enormous potential. We need to bridge the digital divide instead of deepening it.” The OpenAIchief executive, Sam Altman, told a Davos event on Tuesday that an energy breakthrough was necessary to meet the future demands of AI, which will consume vastly more power than people expected. The chief executive, who was sacked last November from his role running the ChatGPT developer and then reinstated a few days later, said the silver lining was that more climate-friendly sources of energy, particularly nuclear fusion or cheaper solar power and storage, were the way forward for AI. Guterres also criticised fossil fuel companies for preventing progress on climate change. “The fossil fuel industry has just launched yet another multimillion-dollar campaign to kneecap progress and keep the oil and gas flowing indefinitely,” he said. “Let me be very clear: the phase-out of fossil fuels is essential and inevitable. No amount of spin or scare tactics will change that. Let’s hope it doesn’t come too late. We must act now to ensure a just and equitable transition to renewable energy.” Last year, Guterres accused fossil fuel companies of pursuing business strategies incompatible with human development, saying: “These two issues – climate and AI – are exhaustively discussed by governments, by the media, by leaders here in Davos. And yet, we have no effective global strategy to deal with either. “In the face of the serious, even existential threats posed by runaway climate chaos, and the runaway development of AI without guardrails, we seem powerless to act.”"

        "content": "Thousands of passengers have been awarded a total of £1.2m in compensation from Wizz Air as part of a landmark action against the budget airline after years of complaints by passengers. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) revealed on Wednesday that about 6,000 passengers had received payouts – equivalent to more than £200 each – since it launched the enforcement process in July last year. The first-of-its-kind action led to the air industry regulator forcing the Hungarian carrier to pay back holidaymakers whose refund claims over cancelled flights had been wrongly rejected.   Related: Boeing opens factories to airlines and adds more checks after blowout   Paul Smith, the consumer director at the CAA, said the scale of successful claims validated its decision to act, and the outcomes would improve the experience for WizzAir customers in the future. The enforcement action followed months of complaints by passengers, who reported missed refund payments as well instances of Wizz Air failing to meet other obligations such as finding alternative flights after cancellations. It meant passengers who felt that they had not been properly recompensed could request reviews of cases stretching back as far as 2016. The CAA said so far more than 25,000 claims had been re-examined, with just under one in every four being successful. This is well above the 15,000 cases the CAA expected could be reopened when launching the action last summer. Sample checks were carried out by the aviation watchdog on claims to ensure that passengers were receiving what they were owed. It said these checks gave it reassurances Wizz Air has met its air passenger rights obligations for these claims. Wizz Air was named the UK’s worst airline last year by the consumer body Which?, and has been frequently criticised over its customer service. As well as being left stranded when flights were cancelled, passengers complained about being charged fees at the airport by the airline when they had been unable to check in due to technical problems with its website. Smith said: “Passengers have every right to expect their claims to be resolved quickly, efficiently and in line with the regulations. These outcomes will now provide Wizz Air’s passengers with a better experience.” A Wizz Air spokesperson said: “We are pleased the Civil Aviation Authority has recognised the significant steps Wizz Air has taken to improve performance for our customers. “Like all airlines in Europe, we faced unprecedented operating challenges in the summer of 2022 but the improvements we put in place have led to a better customer experience and our performance in 2023 was among the strongest in the industry. “We are seeing a significant uptick in our customer satisfaction scores and we remain fully committed to continuing to improve our operations in 2024 and beyond.”"

        "content": "Inflation went in the wrong direction at the end of 2023. It might seem like a small, possibly insignificant, reversal of a downward trend, but December’s rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) to 4% in December from 3.9% in November is a blow to the government and the Bank of England in their battle against rising prices. Setting aside the quirks in the figures, such as the rise in tobacco prices after a sharp increase in duty, the real problem was how businesses continue to charge each other ever-larger bills for their services. Last year, they had good reason to put up prices. They had higher gas and electricity prices to pay and workers had begun to play catch-up in annual wage demands to prevent a potentially huge drop in their living standards. Those pressures are ebbing away now, but still services firms are charging ever higher amounts for their work, and that is being passed on to consumers.   Related: UK inflation unexpectedly rises as cost of tobacco and alcohol increases   Competition is supposed to prevent this happening. And while it seems to be influencing sectors such as food, where price inflation is coming down, in the areas of the economy most of us cannot see – the myriad of buying and selling for business and financial services – competition is failing to work its magic. Core inflation, which excludes items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, was unexpectedly unchanged at 5.1% and services inflation increased from 6.1% to 6.2%. There are analysts who believe the Bank of England will be influenced by the latest figures to caution against any predictions of interest rate cuts. Before Wednesday’s CPI release, financial markets had expected five rate cuts this year starting in May, taking the cost of borrowing down from 5.25% to below 4%. That timeline has since shifted slightly, with investors now forecasting June to be the start date for perhaps just four rate cuts this year.   Interactive  France, Germany and the US have seen the same blips in the downward path of inflation and officials at the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which covers the 20 members of the eurozone, have made more cautious speeches in recent days about the path of interest rate reductions. The UK is expected to see a small rise in January’s figures when they are published next month, which economists are ready to put down to dramatic falls in energy price inflation last year that declines over the subsequent 12 months could not match.  A rise in CPI for December and again in January will certainly make the Bank think twice about signalling sharp cuts in rates. It could judge that services companies need more harsh medicine in the form of high interest rates to force them to bring down prices. If that is the Bank’s solution, Jeremy Hunt’s plan to boast of sharply falling interest rates during an election campaign will be toast. There are still 1.5m households waiting to remortgage this year and their finances will look burned as well. Then again, much-predicted declines in the CPI during February, March and April, taking inflation down to 2% – notwithstanding an escalation of the Middle East conflict and its effect on shipping – could prove financial market bets to be more savvy than they currently look."

BP said Auchincloss, who has acted as interim chief executive since September, would take up the permanent role with immediate effect. He succeeds Looney, who stepped down after failing to disclose to the board personal relationships with colleagues. The appointment brings to an end a “robust and competitive search process” that many believed would lead to the oil supermajor’s first external chief executive hire in its history.   Related: Drax gets go-ahead for carbon capture project at estimated £40bn cost to bill-payers   Auchincloss, a 53-year-old Canadian national, joined BP when it took over the oil company Amoco in 1998 and has been on the board since he became chief financial officer four years ago. In his new role he will take home an annual salary of £1.45m before pension and bonus opportunities. He reportedly competed for the role against Carol Howle, BP’s head of trading and shipping, and Emma Delaney, the head of customers and products. The chief executive of BAE Systems, Charles Woodburn, was also reportedly linked to the role. Helge Lund, the BP chair, said: “Since September, BP’s board has undertaken a thorough and highly competitive process to identify BP’s next CEO, considering a number of high-calibre candidates in detail. The board is in complete agreement that Murray was the outstanding candidate and is the right leader for BP. “Many already know Murray well, and few know BP better than he does. His assured leadership, focus on performance and delivery, and deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the energy transition will serve BP well as we continue our disciplined transformation to an integrated energy company.” Auchincloss said: “Our strategy – from international oil company to integrated energy company, or IOC to IEC – does not change. I’m convinced about the significant value we can create. “Now, more than ever, our focus must remain on delivery – operating safely and efficiently, executing with discipline, and always focusing on returns. This is how we will deliver real benefits for our customers and other stakeholders and continue to grow long-term value for BP’s shareholders.” Looney became the third of BP’s last four bosses to leave the role abruptly when he announced his decision to step down with immediate effect last September. BP said Looney had admitted that he had not been “fully transparent in his previous disclosures” about personal relationships with colleagues, and “accepts he was obligated to make more complete disclosure”."

In short, we need action now.”   Related: The Guardian view on wealth taxes: UK needs one on millionaires and billionaires | Editorial   A new poll of the super-rich shows that 74% support higher taxes on wealth to help address the cost of living crisis and improve public services. A survey, conducted by Survation on behalf of campaign group Patriotic Millionaires, polled more than 2,300 respondents from G20 countries who hold more than $1m (£790,000) in investable assets, excluding their homes – putting them in the richest 5%. The polling found that 58% supported the introduction of a 2% wealth tax on people with more than $10m, and that 54% thought that extreme wealth was a threat to democracy. Guy Singh-Watson, the British farmer-turned-entrepreneur who founded vegetable box delivery company Riverford, said: “This poll seems to show that the whole world, including the richest people, wants to tax the super-rich. So where on Earth is the leadership from our elected representatives who have the power to actually do it? We, the very richest, are sick and tired of inaction, so it’s hardly surprising that working people, at the sharp end of our rigged economies, have lost all patience.” A “modest” 1.7% wealth tax on the richest 140,000 people in the UK could raise more than £10bn to help pay for public services, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggested last year. The richest 250 families in the UK are sitting on combined wealth of £748bn, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list, an increase from £704bn the previous year. Those on the list included the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and his wife, Akshata Murty, at number 275 out of 350, with £529m between them, and the 32-year-old Duke of Westminster, with £9.9bn, at number 11. Cox, an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actor, said: “We are living in a second ‘Gilded Age’. Billionaires are wielding their extreme wealth to accumulate political power and influence, simultaneously undermining democracy and the global economy. It’s long past time to act. If our elected officials refuse to address this concentration of money and power, the consequences will be dire.”"

        "content": "The two-month campaign by Houthi rebels against commercial ships in the Red Sea has caused severe disruption to global shipping. The US and UK have responded with a series of strikes against Houthi targets aimed at stopping further attacks and protecting trade through the crucial shipping route. Has it worked? Here, the Guardian has a look at the impact the strikes have had on trade. What action did the US and UK take? In the early hours of 12 January, the US and UK armed forces launched a string of military strikes in Yemen. The strikes saw 60 targets hit across 28 Houthi-held locations in the west of Yemen, and targeted munitions depots and launching systems, in an effort to limit the rebel group’s ability to launch further attacks. They came after a campaign by the Houthi rebels in the Red Sea in retaliation against Israel’s action in Gaza. Some of the largest shipping companies, such as Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and Mediterranean Shipping Company, have suspended travel along the route. Have there been any attacks by the Houthis since the US-UK strikes? Yes. On Tuesday, a Greek-owned bulk carrier was damaged after being hit by a missile while travelling in the southern part of the Red Sea, the third incident in three days. It came after Houthi rebels hit an American-owned container ship the Gibraltar Eagle with a ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. Marco Forgione, the director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade, points out that this attack happened away from the Bab el-Mandeb strait in the Red Sea, the area where most attacks have taken place. “Now we’re seeing an escalation beyond the Red Sea,” he says. The Houthis have said the US-UK strikes had little impact on their ability to carry out further attacks. Crucially, the group has explicitly stated that UK and US-linked ships are now targets, alongside Israeli-affiliated ships. How have the US-UK strikes affected traffic? Traffic through the Red Sea has nosedived since the first Houthi attack on 17 November. Analysis from the German economic institute IfW Kiel found that the number of containers travelling through the strait fell by 60% in December. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that 114 vessels had passed through Bab el-Mandeb strait in the days after the strikes. This was down from 131 a week ago, and 272 a month ago. Neil Roberts, the head of marine and aviation at the Lloyd’s Market Association, says a warning by the UK and US Combined Maritime Forces to avoid the area last week has led to caution from shipping operators. “There’s been a pause in some more shipping because of the warning. There are ships either end [of the Red Sea] who are in a holding pattern awaiting developments.” The strikes have also prompted more tankers carrying oil and gas to avoid the strait. Unlike cargo ships, tanker traffic remained largely unchanged in December despite the Houthi attacks, but analysis by Reuters on Monday found that 15 of these tankers heading for the Red Sea had altered course. Qatar, the world’s second largest exporter of liquified gas, confirmed it would stop sending LNG tankers through the Red Sea after the latest strikes. Are some ships still travelling through the area? Yes, dozens of ships are continuing journeys despite the increased risks. But this comes at a cost, with those opting to sail on facing higher insurance premiums. Vessel insurance for passing the strait has increased to 1% of a ship’s value, from 0.7% last week. It is also adding to labour costs for shipping businesses, as companies have to pay more due to the risk. In December, the International Bargaining Forum, which negotiates seafarer wages, agreed a bonus equal to their basic wage for workers for the duration of their trip through the Red Sea. Are these ships doing anything to avoid attacks? “Some of the ships are turning off their automatic identification system, other ships are declaring that they are not Israeli affiliated,” says John Stawpert at the International Chamber of Shipping. In extreme cases, some vessels are declaring links to Russia and China, to ward off the Houthis. Many of those travelling through the strait are updating the US and UK forces on their positions more regularly, so they can respond quickly if an attack does occur. Some vessels are even getting US navy protection. A spokesperson for Maersk told the Guardian a US-flagged vessel owned by a subsidiary had received an escort as it was carrying cargo belonging to the US Department of Defense. Where are ships avoiding the Red Sea going instead? Those that want to avoid the Red Sea can take the longer, and more costly, detour around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of South Africa. A trip from Rotterdam to Singapore via the Cape of Good Hope is nearly 4,000 nautical miles longer when compared with the Red Sea route, and takes about 10 days more. Xeneta, an ocean trade analytics platform, has estimated that this could cost up to $3m more per ship, including $1m in additional fuel and $300,000 on insurance and crew. What is happening to container prices? The effect is already being felt in terms of cargo costs. The average cost of shipping a 40ft container from one location to another increased from $4,300 last weekend to $5,650 on Tuesday. A month ago, these freight rates were $1,875. William Bain, the head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, says: “With no sign of an end to this disruption, it represents a significant challenge, especially when combined with other global headwinds which traders are facing. “As the price increases on shipping feed through into business costs, and supply chain disruption deepens, it will almost certainly place upward pressure on inflation.” Are there precedents for this disruption? The “tanker wars” between Iraq and Iran, which ran from 1984 to 1988, saw both sides target merchant vessels and oil tankers across the Persian Gulf. Stawpert says there are some similarities with piracy issues in the Indian Ocean, but adds that the Houthi missile attacks represent a greater potential for damage to vessels. In previous crises, he says, the presence of warships restored confidence for shipping businesses. How long will the disruption last? The answer lies largely with the Houthis. The group has vowed to continue attacks until Israel stops its war in Gaza, and this week’s attacks show it still has the capability and appetite to launch them."

        "content": "Drax has received permission from the government to fit carbon capture technology to its wood-burning power plant, in a project that could cost bill-payers more than £40bn. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, on Tuesday approved the project to convert two of its biomass units to use the technology.  Analysts have predicted that the revamp of the North Yorkshire site could be one of the most expensive energy projects in the world. The project could add about £1.7bn to energy bills every year if the company acts on plans to fit all four of its biomass units with carbon capture technology, or a total of more than £43bn, according to Ember, a climate thinktank. In addition, the government is expected within days to extend a lucrative bill-payer-backed subsidy scheme that last year paid Drax more than £600m to burn trees for electricity until the end of the decade. The decision is likely to anger environmentalists, who have campaigned against burning imported wood pellets and have opposed the multi-billion-pound subsidies paid to Drax over the past 12 years. The planning decision said the project would “make a meaningful contribution” to the urgent need for carbon capture storage infrastructure to support the government’s net zero ambitions. A separate decision about its subsidy payments will follow before 2027. Will Gardiner, Drax’s chief executive, said the planning approval “demonstrates both the continued role that Drax power station has in delivering UK energy security and the critical role it could have in delivering large-scale carbon dioxide removals to meet net zero targets”. A report commissioned by Drax has claimed that adding carbon capture to its biomass power units could save the UK economy up to £15bn between 2030 and 2050 when compared to other, more complex carbon reduction measures using biomass. Phil MacDonald, the chief operating officer at Ember, said the report ignored the “immediate real costs” of building the plant, which are likely to fall to taxpayers or energy users. “Over 20 years, this could make Drax’s BECCS plans one of the most expensive energy projects in the world, funded from bill-payers’ pockets,” MacDonald said. Drax has argued that burning biomass is carbon neutral because regrowing sustainable forests absorbs similar amounts of carbon dioxide as burning the wood in a power plant. Using biomass with carbon capture, known as BECCS, would be create the world’s first “carbon negative power station”, according to Drax. The claims have been challenged by scientists and climate experts. The company’s green claims are also being scrutinised by the energy regulator, Ofgem, and the National Audit Office, which are undertaking separate investigations into the sustainability criteria of the government’s biomass strategy after fierce criticism by green groups. A government spokesperson said Ember’s estimates were “entirely speculative” as no decisions about the plant’s carbon capture technology, or additional subsidy, had yet been made. “Any potential support awarded to Drax would be subject to a value for money and affordability assessment and subsidy control considerations – ensuring that any tax- and bill-payer money is spent wisely,” the spokesperson said."

        "content": "Fujitsu is still providing data from the Horizon IT system for use in legal actions against post office operators, the inquiry into the Post Office scandal has heard.\nThe Post Office, which relentlessly prosecuted more than 900 post office operators across the UK for alleged theft, fraud and false accounting, stopped directly bringing cases in 2015.\nAny subsequent potential cases of theft or fraud identified at a branch are referred to police, and ultimately the Crown Prosecution Service if there is enough evidence.\n\n Related: What is the Post Office Horizon IT scandal all about? \n\nSam Stein QC, representing the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) and more than 200 individual post office operators, asked a current employee about Fujitsu’s subsequent involvement at the inquiry on Tuesday.\n“Cases are still being prosecuted of subpostmasters, this time by the CPS, using data by Fujitsu,” he said. “To your knowledge, is the Horizon system still being used to provide data that is used in court proceedings?”\n“Yes, I think it is,” said Rajbinder Sangha, who worked in Fujitsu’s fraud and litigation office from 2010 to 2016 before moving departments.\nThe inquiry into the scandal led by a judge, Sir Wyn Williams, began last year, and has gained greater public attention since the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, aired earlier this month. At a separate hearing on Tuesday, Fujitsu’s European boss, Paul Patterson, said for the first time that the company should contribute to financial redress for victims.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe public inquiry into the scandal also heard that Fujitsu knew of faults in the system it used to extract data on Post Office transactions, subsequently used in the prosecution of hundreds of post office operators, as early as 2008. Evidence presented to the inquiry suggested bosses at Fujitsu were concerned at the time that defence lawyers “may spot and call into question the integrity of our data”.\nSangha, who changed departments in 2017, was one of a small team responsible for processing queries on post office operator transactions known as audit record queries (ARQ). She was asked if she was aware that Horizon IT data was still requested and used in current court proceedings.\n“Yes, yes I think it is,” she said.\nEmails shown to the inquiry between Fujitsu managers and the fraud and litigation team, which investigated transactions that failed to complete on Post Office systems, revealed that Fujitsu knew about a string of ongoing problems that it did not reveal.\nProblems that Fujitsu found included as many as one-third of transactions being duplicated with some fixes involving “manual workarounds”, which the company knew if exposed could call into question the integrity of the data and therefore prosecution cases.\n“In essence we have a problem with the ARQ extraction tool,” said one executive in one of a number of email exchanges shown at the inquiry covering the period 2008 to 2010. “If we do not fix this problem our spreadsheets presented in court are liable to be brought into doubt if duplicate transactions are spotted.”\nProblems with the system were variously referred to as “inherently insecure” and “endemic”. In 2010, it emerged that a so-called “fast ARQ” method developed to collect the data did not distinguish duplicate transactions when it was handed over to the Post Office.\n“The customer [Post Office] and indeed the defence and court would assume that the duplicates were bona fide transactions and this would be incorrect,” stated an email in 2010. “There are a number of high-profile court cases in the pipeline and it is imperative that we provide accurate records. Defence teams may spot this and call into question the integrity of our data. This will call into question the reliability of the evidence presented by the prosecution team.”\nFujitsu executives hoped to present data to make prosecution evidence “more consistent”, in an effort to ensure hundreds of ultimately wrongfully brought cases would “go through smoothly”.\nAs part of this process it was decided at Fujitsu not to keep a “known error log” of the bugs, or disclose them to defence teams as they tried to fix them.\nAn email in March 2010, from principal security consultant Tom Lillywhite, raised an instance where the migration of a post office operator to the faulty Horizon IT system meant the ARQ data gathered about transactions at the branch should “bear a health warning”.\nThe email said there had been “technical issues with the migration which Post Office specialists are aware”, adding that “information gathered in respect to this particular ARQ may be subject to issues of integrity”.\n“Any response from us would have to bear the health warning that there was no guarantee as to the integrity of the data provided by us,” Lillywhite added.\nBy 2013, Fujitsu employee Gerald Barnes admitted in an email there was a “serious flaw” spotted in the audit code and later that year Gareth Jenkins, the former chief architect at Fujitsu, said in an email there was a “significant bug affecting 13 branches causing some interest with high levels of management in the Post Office and Fujitsu”.\n“At the time I didn’t see a concern,” said Sangha, who was not party to all the emails, on Tuesday. “It would have been dealt with by more senior technical people that had more of an understanding. I saw my role as just processing ARQs.”"

        "content": "Fujitsu’s admission that it has “a moral obligation” to pay redress to victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal has arrived very late in the day. The obligation was surely created on the day in November 2019 that the high court ruled that “bugs, errors and defects” in the company’s Horizon system meant there was a “material risk” that faulty data was used in the prosecution of post office operators. To state the obvious, it should not have taken ITV’s dramatisation of the scandal, and the appearance in front of MPs of the current head of European operations, Paul Patterson, to produce Tuesday’s corporate acceptance that Fujitsu will have to cough up something. The firm’s previous silence, even as the Post Office and ministers were forced to accept reality, has been deafening. How much should Fujitsu pay? Or what proportion of a redress bill that Kevin Hollinrake, the postal minister, said is now likely to top £1bn? That was the point at which Patterson, presumably with warnings from the company’s lawyers ringing in his ears, avoided precision. While his apology was clear on several grounds – “We were involved from the very start. We did have bugs and errors in the system. And we did help the Post Office in their prosecutions of the subpostmasters” – Patterson wasn’t going to talk specific sums for redress. “We expect to sit down with the government to determine our contribution,” he said. One can understand why he thinks it’s best to wait until Sir Wyn Williams’s official inquiry has said where responsibility lies. But we’ve surely heard enough already to say that, if the eventual bill for redress is £1bn-plus, Fujitsu’s contribution should run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Yes, it was the Post Office that pursued the prosecutions, which is why primary blame must sit with it and its management – no question. But Fujitsu was complicit. It designed the dodgy software and its employees appeared as star witnesses in the prosecutions, which is why Patterson’s answer when asked on Tuesday whether staff knew there were bugs and glitches in the system before 2010 was as significant as his apology. “My gut feeling would be yes,” he said. Indeed, emails at the separate public inquiry showed employees discussing glitches in 2008. Prosecutions, remember, continued until 2015. Information was shared with the Post Office, continued Patterson, arguing that “how the Post Office used that information and used it to help their prosecutions, that is up to them.” Well, yes, but what about the stages in between? In what terms were the warnings of bugs conveyed, and when? When helplines were flooded with complaints, did Fujitsu’s management ever pause to examine whether its software could be causing discrepancies in post office operators’ accounts? An extraordinary detail that emerged from Tuesday’s session was that prosecutions, pre-Horizon, ran at five a year but soared to an average of 55 after its introduction. And who was the Fujitsu boss, according to Paula Vennells, the disgraced former Post Office chief executive, who gave the assurance that the Horizon system was “like Fort Knox”? To repeat, the Post Office is the top villain here. Lord Arbuthnot, who campaigned on behalf of Horizon victims, perhaps put his finger on the deep reason why the scandal ran for so long. It was because it involved “people who have been convicted of crime, up against the most trusted brand in the country”. The management of the Post Office, in other words, wholly abused a reputation for trust that was earned by “the relationships that subpostmasters had with communities” rather than any brilliance in the boardroom. But it is also true that Fujitsu’s role has been understated in the outside world’s understanding of the scandal. A faulty product lies at the heart, which is why it is also staggering that the government has continued to award public sector contracts to Fujitsu as if nothing had happened. If a reckoning has now arrived, the Japanese firm’s “moral obligation”, arising from a contract from which it has been paid £2.4bn since 1999, has to be turned into a meaningful sum for redress. The public purse should not have to pick up the whole sum. Hollinrake, for the government, referred to “maximising the contribution to the taxpayer”. Inviting Fujitsu to pay half would be a reasonable opening pitch."

If the US stops sending financial and military commitments then Western Europe will follow.”\n\nFerguson also shared his opinion on what a victory might look like for Russia’s Vladimir Putin: \n\n“It would be a victory for Putin even if Ukraine retained the majority of its 1991 territory, but was economically unable to survive or to prosper [which would signal] a failure of the Western alliance that was hastily formed in 2022.”\n\nThis would also be a failure of US leadership, said Ferguson, adding:\n\n“We cannot allow Ukraine to lose this war. We cannot allow Putin to claim victory, because financial, economic and moral costs to us will be unacceptably high.”\n\n\n\n\n 2.21pm GMT \n\nGoldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon has a lot to juggle this week. Not only is he Davos-bound, but he’ll have to spin a positive tale despite revealing the bank’s lowest annual profits since 2019. \nThe Wall Street lender today revealed a 24% drop in full-year profits for 2023, tumbling to $8.5bn (£6.7bn ) from $11.bn a year earlier. That was due in part to a $1bn worth of write downs on its consumer business, and the sale of GreenSky, which provided loans for home improvements. \nWhile its equities division managed to eke out a 5% jump in revenues by year-end, thanks to a market rebound, a sluggish year for dealmaking meant Goldman’s investment bank – known as its global banking and markets division – suffered an 8% drop in revenues.\nBut Solomon is already trying to turn attention to the year ahead. He said in a statement: \n\n“This was a year of execution for Goldman Sachs. With everything we achieved in 2023 coupled with our clear and simplified strategy, we have a much stronger platform for 2024.\nOur strategic objectives underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence, further strengthen our leading client franchise and continue to deliver for shareholders.”\n\nGoldman is the last of the major US banks to report full year earnings, with most having revealed the state of their finances last week. \nOn Friday, JP Morgan, America’s largest bank, reported record full-year profits, which rose 32% to $49.6bn thanks to higher interest rates and its acquisition of First Republic, one of the regional banks that failed last year.\nCiti, meanwhile, made headlines after revealing plans to cut 20,000 of its 39,000 global staff by the end of 2026 as part of a major restructuring programme. It came as full year profits tumbled 38% per cent to $9.2bn.\n\n Related: Citigroup to cut 20,000 jobs after steep quarterly loss \n\n\n\n\n 1.54pm GMT \nZelenskiy: Strengthen our economy and we willl strengthen your security.\n\nJust time for one more question….\nQ: You had 70 global CEOs in a room this morning (full details here) – what can we do to help you?\nOur main strength is our people, Volodymyr Zelenskiy replies, who have proved they are smart, talented, modern, smart-witted and brave.\nHe says:\n\nOnly our people and your investments can rebuild a resilient economy.\n\nNew investments, provided with transparency, will create new employment opportunities and allow our people to come back from abroad.\nAnd he ends with a sales pitch:\n\nStrengthen our economy and we willl strengthen your security.\n\nThe hall then rises to its feet for a standing ovation – a rare tribute at Davos, although Zelenskiy also received one last year when he gave a speech by video conference (Nelson Mandela got on too!).\n\n\n\n 1.47pm GMT \n\nVolodymyr Zelelskiy then explains that there must be justice, rather than revenge against Russia.\nThe Ukrainian people will never forgive Putin, and the people who committed this terrorism, who took time from our children who were deprived of their childhood, he says.\nThere must be accountability, and consequences, he says.\nAnd he rejects the suggestion that time is on the Russian president’s side. Neither Putin, nor his children or grandchildren, will have rest, Zelenskiy says.\n\n\n\n 1.42pm GMT \n\nOnto questions:\nQ: How long will the Russian people allow Putin to continue this war?\nSwitching to Ukrainian, Zelenskiy says it depends how long the Russian people are prepared to be deaf, to not hear or see anything, and pretend everything is all right\nThat’s a question for the people of the Russian Federation, whether they are cabable of changing themselves, not for me, Zelenskiy says, adding;\n\nI don’t believe Putin is capable of changing, because only humans can do that.\n\n\n\n\n 1.40pm GMT \n\nZelenskiy tells the packed out Congress Hall at Davos that Ukraine needs their help for the reconstruction effort.\n\n“Each of you can be even more succesful with Ukraine”\n\nHe adds that he has held discussions with the president of Switzerland about holding a global peace summit.\nPeace must win, this must be the answer, he concludes, cueing a second warm round of applause.\n\n\n\n 1.37pm GMT \n\nThis year must be decisive, Volodymyr Zelenskiy insists.\nAnd he questions whether “freezing the war in Ukraine” would actually end the conflict.\nAfter 2014, there were attemps to freeze the war in Donbas, Zelenskiy says.\nBut that didn’t sate Russia’s appetite, saying:\n\nPutin is a predator who is not satisfied by frozen products.\n\nWe have to defend ourselves, he continues. We can beat him on the ground, we have proved it, he adds.\n\n\n\n 1.33pm GMT \n\nZelenskiy then says it was a mistake to tell Ukraine not to escalate the conflict with Russia.\nHe argues that Russia was encouraged to take military action by the warnings to Ukraine not to escalate.\nBecause of ‘don’t escalate’, lives were lost, Zelenskiy says.\nHe also points out that there were concerns about pushing back in the Black Sea, but that has led to 16 million tonnes of cargo has been transported from Ukraine’s ports.\nHow can you be happy with sanctions against Russia if they don’t prevent missile prroduction, he adds, saying that every missile launched contains components from Ukraine’s allies.\nZelenskiy insists that, of course, he is grateful for each package of support.\nBut he says Putin must be made to regret the invasion of Ukraine, explaining:\n\n“The more money Putin and his allies lose, the more he will regret this war….\nWe need to finally dispell the illusion that global unity is weaker than one man’s hatred.”\n\n\nUpdated at 1.50pm GMT\n\n\n 1.25pm GMT \nZelenskiy: Putin has stolen 13 years of peace\n\nZelenskiy begins by launching a blistering condemnation of Russia’s Vladimir Putin.\nHe tells Davos that the full-scale war in Europe has been running for almost two years, but it is almost 10 years since Crimea was annexed by Russia.\nRussia has also been interfering in African countries for many years, he adds, while the Syrian war is still ongoing, for almost 13 years.\n\nOne man has stolen at least 13 years of peace, replacing them with pain, pain, pain and crisis that impact the entire world.\n\nPutin is trying to normalise what should have ended in the 20th century, Zelenskiy continues. That means mass deportations, cities razed to ground, and the feeling that war will never end, he explains.\nZelenskiy continues by warning that Putin will not change, adding that “the madness that resides in this man’s head” must not prevail.\nAnd Zelenskiy then touches on the risk that the conflict spreads further, asking which European nation today can provide a combat-ready army in comparison with Ukraine’s, holding back Russia.\nIt is better to put an end to Putin and his war strategy now, he adds.\n\n\n\n 1.19pm GMT \n\nThe Congress Hall here in Davos has filled up, with delegates eager to hear from Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nThe Ukrainian president walks in, to a warm round of applause.\nWEF founder Klaus Schwab introduces Zelenskiy, saying:\n\nThe brutal aggression on the 24th of February 2022 reminded us that we cannot have global prosperity without peace and security.\n\nUkraine still stands, its people stand, and fight on a daily basis to protect the independence of their homeland, Schwab adds, hailing Ukraine’s incredible resilience.\nUkraine is firmly on the path of European integration, Schwab adds.\n\n\n\n 1.10pm GMT \n\nBloomberg have a video clip of Volodymyr Zelenskiy meeting with business leaders today, including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.\nDimon introduced himself to Zelenskiy thus:\n\n “I’m Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan Chase. God bless you.” \n\n\n\n“God bless you\"JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon wishes Volodymyr Zelenskiy well as they meet at Davos, where the Ukrainian president is working to bolster international support https://t.co/W0Kg9u89xm pic.twitter.com/pMJgLgcnTP— Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) January 16, 2024\n\n\nI think this is a second meeting, following the one which Senator Chris Coons of Delaware attended here in the congress centre.\n\n\n\n 12.45pm GMT \nZelenskiy meets business leaders at Davos\n\nThe mood in the room here where Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with business leaders this morning was “upbeat, determined, positive,” US senator for Delaware, Chris Coons, tells us.\nCoons was one of an estimated 50 or more people who met with Ukraine’s leader today, as Zelenskiy pressed attendees at Davos for their support in the ongoing war with Russia.\nCoons, who sports a badge with both the US and Ukrainian flags linked, explains that the meeting went “very well, it was very encouraging”, and that it was an expression of business and national support for Ukraine.\nZelenskiy gave us an update on the war with Russia, and the determination of the Ukrainian people,” Coons explains, adding:\n\n“He urged that we remain as determined as the Ukranian people and that we see this through.”\n\nThere were a number of bankers in the room (including Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan), and also the head of fertilizer giant Yara, Coons tells us.\nSenator Coons adds that Youtube’s CEO talked about the efforts they have made to take down Russian disinformation and malign content and to make sure that students are able to learn, businesses can communicate, and government can function.\nUrsula von der Leyen made “forceful remarks” about her six visits to Kviv during the war, how impressed she is with their reform movements to combat corruption, to improve transparency to create a good business environment.\nAttendees also heard from Jens Stoltenburg, the head of Nato, about about the status of the war, and some of the crucial progress in the Black Sea, the challenges of the spring and summer offensive.\nStoltenburg encouraged everyone to remain committed and determined, Coons says.\nPenny Pritzker, the US special representative for Ukraine economic recovery, told the meeting about how she recently took a group of US business representatives to Kyiv to see for themselves the possibilities.\nCoons, who sat next to Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck, was also complimentary about Ukraine, telling us:\n\nI spoke about how in my own manufacturing business, we used to say ‘hire for attitude, train for skill’.\nThe Ukrainian people have shown they have both – ferocious determination, a great attitude, a work ethic and determination, and very good skills, technical ability and agility, engineering skills, the capacity to find a way even when desperately outgunned and outmanned by a much bigger force.\nThat’s a great place to invest.\nI spoke about the Marshall Plan, and how it wasn’t charity, it was in America’s own security and economic interest.\n\nOne European banker pointed out that while the Marshall Plan was a great thing, it took America several years after the end of the war to actually offer the help.\nCoons argues the process can start even before the war is over, in parts of the country less affected by the conflict which are stable and secure.\nHe says:\n\nHere we need to begin now, we need to now wait until it is fully, finally over?\n\nOn funding, Coons told the meeting with confidence that United States will deliver the $61bn which is in President Biden’s supplemental funding request.\nCoons, a key Biden ally, tells us:\n\n“There will be a lot of disagreement, there will be a lot of sturm und drang, a lof of noise, but I am confident that within a few weeks it will pass.”\n\nVon der Leyen told the meeting that she is confident the 50bn euros from the EU for development for the next four years will also pass.\nConcerns that the Middle East could push Ukraine off the geopolitical agenda were also referenced in the meeting, Coons says.\nBut he is confident that there is support on both sides of the Senate to defend and support Ukraine.\nHe adds that US financial support has helped Ukraine’s agricultural sector, and the wider economy, citing its remarkable growth this year.\n\nIt’s grown almost 5% this year, in the middle of a war, a punishing war, where you’ve got huge amounts of land now unfarmable, filled with mines and unexploded ordinance, 10s of thousands of men who should be at work on the front lines, and with millions of people having left the country.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.24pm GMT \n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy has now held a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, here in Davos:\n\n\n\n 11.29am GMT \nVon der Leyen warns West against slowing support for Ukraine\n\nBack in the Congress Hall here, Ursula von der Leyen warned the West not to stop supplying Ukraine with weapons and money if it wants Kyiv to succeed in its war against Russia.\nVon der Leyen – who took part in Ukraine’s meeting with business chiefs this morning – told delegates:\n\n“Ukraine can prevail in this war but we must continue to empower their resistance.\n“Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory.”\n\n\nUpdated at 11.30am GMT\n\n\n 11.17am GMT \nTheresa May and Princess Eugenie warn of modern slavery dangers\n\nGovernments are failing to properly tackle the scourge of slavery and human trafficking even as it increases, former UK prime minister Theresa May has warned, here in Davos on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.\nClimate change, wars and the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to the problem, she said.\n\n“We’ve seen in recent years the number people in slavery increasing around the world.\n“Conflict, the pandemic, the impact of climate change increase vulnerability to it.\nAt the same time governments are taking their attention off it.”\n\nMay, who heads the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, was speaking at an event on modern slavery at Davos alongside Princess Eugenie, who co-founded The Anti-Slavery Collective in 2017.\n“Guns and drugs can be only trafficked once but human beings are trafficked again and again and again,” said Eugenie.\n\n“For them it happens every day and minute.”\n\nMay said companies “need to really pay attention to supply chains” and government need to set tighter laws.\n\nUpdated at 11.19am GMT\n\n\n 10.54am GMT \nVon der Leyen: Russia is failing in Ukraine war\n\nOn Ukraine, Ursule von der Leyen says Russia is failing on its strategic goals. \nMoscow has lost half of its military capabilities, and been driven out of half the territory it captured.\nUkraine has pushed back Russia’s Black Sea fleet, and begun supplying grain to the world again, she says.\nIt has been an economic failure too; Western sanctions mean Russia is now dependent on China.\nIt has also been a diplomatic failure, with Finland joining NATO, and Ukraine closer than ever in its path to joining the European Union, von der Leyen says.\nBut Ukraine needs more help – financing in 2024 and beyond, weapons supplies for the war, and to deter future action by Russia.\n\n\n\n 10.51am GMT \n\nNext up, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.\nShe starts by reminding Davos delegates that last week’s WEF global risks report showed that misinformation and disinformation are biggest short-term risks.\nThese risks are limiting leaders’ ability to tackle the big global challenges we are facing, von der Leyen warns.\nShe says that Europe can and must take the lead in shaping the global response to falling trust, and that the private sector had a crucial role to play.\nThis will be a crucial year for trust in information, she adds, as democracies across the world head to the polls, in elections that will affect half the global population.\n\n\n\n 10.39am GMT \nLi: China believes AI must do good for humanity\n\nOnto questions\nQ: what role will China play in artificial intelligence?\nLi says artificial intelligence is a catchphrase, and that people love generative AI such as ChatGPT – but there is also suprise and some fear in some quarters about what it can do.\nThis technology seems omnipitant, he says, but people are taking time to get used to it.\nHe then describes AI as a double-edged sword.\nIf applied well, it can do good and improve human civilisation, and give great impetus to the scientific revolution.\nBut it also poses risks to security and to our ethics.\nHe tells delegates:\n\nChina believes that technology must serve the common good of humanity. \nIt must do good, and the same applies to artificial intelligence.\n\nLi then explains that AI must be people-centred. People must control the machines, rather than the machines controlling us.\nThus, policymakers must facilitate good AI with appropriate governance.\nSecond, AI must be inclusive and beneficial for all, not just a small group of people.\nTherefore, it is essential that countries work together and coordinate together, so they can share benefits together.\nHe adds that the interest of developing countries should be prioritised, to close the technology gap with other countries.\n\n\n\n 10.34am GMT \n\nPremier Li then pledges that China will open its door still wider to the world.\nHe tells business chiefs in the audience here that choosing to invest in the Chinese market is not a risk, but actually an opportunity.\nHe says China is working on policies to address concerns about cross-border data flows, and will take active steps to address reasonable concerns of the global business community.\n\n\n\n 10.26am GMT \n\nLi tells Davos that China’s demographic dividend is turning into talent dividend, and teh country will implement new technologies (such as the blockchain, and cloud computing) at a faster pace.\nDelivering modernisation to 1.4 billion people will be a remarkable achievement in human history, he points out, pledging that China will play a key role in boosting aggregate global demand. \n\n\n\n 10.22am GMT \nLi: China grew 5.2% last year\n\nThe world economic recovery requires strong underpinnings, Li points out.\nAnd on the challenge of assessing China’s economy, he compares it to viewing the Alps – you need to step back and view it from a distance, to get the full picture.\nLi says the Chinese economy is making steady progress, and will continue to provide a strong impetus for the world economy.\nOver the years, China’s contribution to world economic growth has remained at around 30%. The economy rebounded last year and moved upward, with estimated growth of 5.2%, he reveals.\nPointedly, Li adds that China didnt resort to massive stimulus, and focused on promoting development.\n\nUpdated at 11.41am GMT\n\n\n 10.20am GMT \nLi: China's five-point plan to rebuild trust\n\nChina’s premier Li Qiang tells Davos he has a five-point plan to rebuild trust.\n1) Strenthen macroeconomic policy coordination, to create better synergy and thus faster growth.\nHe warns that because economies are more linekd today, there are more spillover effects when. So if there are “fragmented responses” to crises, the world economy will become more fragile.\n2) strengthen international industrial specialisation and cooperation, to keep supply chains “stable and smooth”.\nHe cites figures showing that 5,400 new discriminationary trade measures were introduced from 2020 to 2023, nearly doubling the number before the pandemic.\n3:) enhance cooperation in innovation.\nHe says countries should work together for an open, just and non-discriminationary environment for science and technology, to let innovation thrive in an open environment\n4) Strengthern cooperationon green development, to better tackle climate change.\nHe criticises the practice of erecting barriers to green trade, so some green technology cannot flow freely.\n[Li may be thinking of the European Union’s push for restrictions on the import of green technologies from China]\nLi argues countries must work together for a complete transiation to green economy\n5) strenthen north-south and south-south cooperation, to build a more inclusive world economy.\nHe warns that issues such as the tech divide have become more acute in recent years.\nTrue development is development for all, Li says, adding the the world must fully implement the UN’s 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and bridge development gaps.\nSumming up, Li adds that the best way to earn trust is to be a better version of ourselves.\n\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \nLi Qiang addresses Davos\n\nLi Qiang, premier of the People’s Republic of China, is addressing Davos now,\nLi is introduced by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who says Li had an illustrious career in public service, rising up through the ranks to run three of China’s most economically vigorous regions.\nSchwab adds that Li is seen as a pro-business and pro-reform leader.\nLi then takes to the stage here in the Congress Hall.\nLi says the theme of this year’s WEF meeting, “rebuilding trust”, will strike a chord with many people.\nHe explains that trust between countries allowed huge progress in globalisation over past decades.\nBut the foundation of trust has been eroded, which Li says is aggrevating risks to global growth and peaceful development.\nHe says it is essential to rebuild trust, whether to overcome current difficulties or to create a better future.\nIt is essential that we discard prejudice, and work together to tackle the trust deficit, Li insists.\nHe adds that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation.\nBut, he insists, the overall dynamics of world progress moving forwards will not change.\n\n\n\n 9.58am GMT \n\nViola Amherd, President of the Swiss Confederation, is warning delegates here at Davos about the rise of fake news and misinformation.\nShe says Switzerland supports the global governance of artificial intelligence.\nThose who rely on lies and misinformation may benefit in the short term, but in the long term they will lose trust, Amherd says.\nShe also reminds WEF attendees that some in the general public distrust all of us here.\nRebuilding trust is not just a job for states and politicians, she argues, it is a responsibility for the economy too.\nIncreased social inbalances fuel populism, Amherd points out.\nAnd when the elite flaunt its wealth when ordinary familes can barely make ends meet, mistrust grows, she adds.\n\n\n\n 9.52am GMT \n\nQatar’s prime minister has told Davos that requiring Israel to agree to a time-bound, mandatory path to a two-state solution is key to achieving future stability in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum today, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said the Palestinians must be the ones to decide if the Hamas movement that runs Gaza will continue to play a political role in the future, Reuters adds.\n\n\nWe are concerned about the further escalation in the Red Sea: PM in conversation at World Economic Forum#Qatar #WEF24 #Davos

Brian Moynihan, chief executive officer of Bank of America, tells us it was “terrific”, but declines to give more details.\n\n\n\n 9.38am GMT \n\nWe’ve had a quick chat with Harvard economics professor Ken Rogoff, one of the many experts here at the WEF Annual Meeting.\nRogoff doesn’t buy the soft landing idea that is prevalent in global financial markets, saying:\n\n“I think that is the least likely scenario: we will either have a boom or a recession”.\n\nRogoff, who is a former IMF chief economist, said there was a risk that the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea were an example of the risks to the soft landing scenario. \nHe tells us:\n\n“In the years since I completed my PhD in 1980 I can’t recall so much turbulence. Events are moving so quickly.”\n\n\n\n\n 9.01am GMT \n\nThe First Movers Coalition, a WEF initiative to encourage the decarbonization of the world’s heavy-emitting sectors, has picked up more members.\nThere are now 96 members, who’ve pledged to buy goods and services which only create very low emissions. The idea is to encourage development of breakthrough climate technologies by 2030, by showing there is commercial demand for them.\nNew members includel Qatar Airways, Velux, The Coca Cola Company, GE Vernova, DP World Limited, Capgemini, Danfoss A/S, Hanwha Ocean, Neutron Holdings (Lime), Volvo Cars, Inc., Chooose AS, Boom Technology, Drax Corporate Limited and Norsk Hydro ASA.\nJohn Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, who’s here in Davos this week, says the Coalition is “driving critical progress” in the some of the hardest to address sectors.\nKerry explains:\n\n“As members participate in offtake agreements and invest in decarbonization projects in support of their FMC commitments, they continue to give confidence to this market to develop faster. \nThis approach is pivotal in expanding the use and availability of the breakthrough technological solutions that will enable the deep decarbonization of heavy-emitting sectors.”\n\n\n\n\n 8.47am GMT \nZelenskiy meets “CEOs for Ukraine”\n\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has met business chiefs at a session for “CEOs for Ukraine”, here at the World Economic Forum, before his speech this afternoon.\nHe was seated alongside Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission President, who will also address WEF today:\n\nUpdated at 8.51am GMT\n\n\n 8.16am GMT \nIMF: Governments must wake up to risks of AI and disinformation\n\nGovernments need to “wake up” to the risks of artificial intelligence and disinformation, the boss of the International Monetary Fund has warned.\nKristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said AI poses big risks to financial stability and could also stoke inequality unless regulation catches up.\nWith countries including the US, UK and India holding elections this year, she said the risks of disinformation are “significant and potentially very severe” and a “big driver of mistrust”.\nShe said:\n\n“Artificial intelligence can lead to manipulation of data… for companies and countries in a way that we have not seen so far.\n“It means that governments have to wake up and take this very seriously. At the moment I don’t think that they do.”\n\nGeorgieva, who was speaking at a breakfast organised by Bloomberg at Davos, said its research suggested 60% of jobs in advanced economies are going to be impacted by AI. \n\n“If you are lucky [this means] enhance productivity, [your job is] more enjoyable and very likely better paid.”\n\n\n\n\n 8.11am GMT \n\nThere’s a buzz in the Congress centre here as Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrives for a closed-door meeting here at WEF.\nZelenskiy didn’t speak to the assembled media here, though.\n\n\n\n 8.00am GMT \n\nBill Gates also warned that there was a lack of preparedness for another pandemic, which required the right tools and the right institutions.\nHe said:\n\n“There is some money being spent and some attention paid but not nearly enough”.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.39am GMT\n\n\n 7.57am GMT \n\nBill Gates added that developing countries have seen their debt payments soar in recent years and were unable to borrow as much from the international financial markets. Aid spending had also fallen. \nGates told this morning’s Davos event on the future of health:\n\n“I wish aid budgets were a lot bigger. I wish everybody was at 0.7%”(the UN target for the percentage of national income spent on aid).\n\nGates said his foundation was planning to spend a record $8.6b on health this year - a $2b increase - but warned that there was a risk that health in poor countries would drop down the global agenda. \nGates says:\n\n“I would love to have a global health meeting like COP28 with 70,000 people in attendance”.\n\nWithout mentioning Donald Trump (who has won an overwhelming victory in the US’s first election contest of 2024, in Iowa) by name, Gates said he was concerned that this year’s US presidential election might lead to a reduction in America’s aid budget. \nThe US currently devotes 0.23% of national income to aid but Gates said:\n\n“The US is where the election will have a consequence. You might have a reduction in that aid budget”.\n\n\n\n\n 7.54am GMT \nBill Gates: progress reducing child deaths in Africa has stalled\n\nBill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, says the remarkable progress in reducing child deaths in Africa has stalled since 2019 because of the financial problems being faced by developing countries.\nSpeaking at a Davos event on the future of health, Gates called for rich countries to increase their aid spending to the UN target of 0.7% of GDP.\nHe said:\n\n“From the turn of the century there was tremendous progress in reducing child deaths, which came down from 10 million a year to 5 million a year. Since 2019 the number of deaths has plateaued.”\n\nGates said the international community was way off course to meet the 2030 goal of reducing child deaths to 2.5m a year . The reason – developing countries were unable to invest enough in health care. \nHe warned:\n\n“Progress has two components. The first is upstream research and that part is going very well. The second is the distribution part, the delivery bit - and that’s the bit at risk.”\n\n\n\n\n 7.50am GMT \n\nFrance’s central bank chief has warned Davos that the European Central Bank cannot yet declare victory over inflation.\nBut… governor François Villeroy de Galhau also indicated that the ECB’s next move is likely to be a cut, some time this year.\nECB interest rates are currently a record high, while inflation ended 2023 at 2.9%.\nDe Galhau told a panel here in Davos:\n\n“Barring major surprises - we look at the Middle East - our next move will be a cut, probably this year. I will not comment on the season,”\n\nVilleroy de Galhau also cautioned that the ECB’s focus is inflation – not corporate valuations or the value of the stock markets (which boomed towards the end of last year as hopes of interest rate cuts grow).\nThe IMF’s Gita Gopinath has touched on this issue too, suggesting that market expectations for rapid interest-rate cut are a little premature.\nGopinath said:\n\n“The markets are expecting central banks to cut rates pretty aggressively — I think that’s a bit premature to make that conclusion.\nWe should expect rates to come down some time this year, but based on the data we see right now, we expect this to be more likely in the second half of this year.”\n\n\n\n🔴 IMF'S GOPINATH: WE'VE SEEN FINANCIAL CONDITIONS EASE EVERYWHERE.— FinancialJuice (@financialjuice) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n🔴 IMF'S GOPINATH: EXUBERANCE HAS MADE THE SOFT LANDING CHALLENGE HARDER.— FinancialJuice (@financialjuice) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n#Gopinath #IMF more upside risks to inflation— Silvia Berzoni (@SilviaBerzoni) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.24am GMT\n\n\n 7.38am GMT \nFull story: Geopolitical tensions and AI dominate start of World Economic Forum\n\nGrowing concern that heightened geopolitical tension could damage an already shaky global economy has dominated the start of the annual gathering of the world’s business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland.\nThree potential flash points – Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan – threatened to overshadow the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) aimed at rebuilding trust after the series of setbacks suffered in the past four years, including war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis….\nMore here.\n\n Related: Geopolitical tensions and AI dominate start of World Economic Forum \n\n\n\n\n 7.35am GMT \nChief economists see more economic uncertainty on the horizon\n\nAnxiety over the prospects for the global economy this year is high, according to WEF’s latest poll of chief economists.\nThe annual survey found that global economic prospects remain fraught with uncertainty, with over half of those surveyed expecting the global economy to weaken this year.\nAround three quarters expect labour market conditions to weaken this year – a blow to workers – while seven in 10 predict the pace of geoeconomic fragmentation will accelerate.\nWEF adds:\n\nTwo-thirds said industrial policies will create new growth hotspots, but majority warns of rising fiscal strains and divergence between higher- and lower-income economies.\nGenerative AI is seen to increase productivity and innovation, with experts notably more optimistic about AI-enabled benefits for high-income economies.\n\n\n\n\n 7.33am GMT \nIntroduction: Davos begins....\n\nGood morning from Davos, where world leaders, business chiefs, civic leaders, economists, activists and the media are gathering for the first full day of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting.\nWhile the temperature here in Switzerland is decidedly chilly – a bracing –12 Celsius as delegates trudge through the snow or are chauffered through traffic jams – geopolitical tensions are heating up.\nToday we’ll hear from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as he tries to shore up support from allies as the war against Russia approaches its second anniversary.\nZelenskiy is reportedly planning to meet with JP Morgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon during his visit, as he rallies economic and military support for Kyiv.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Zelenskiy “seeks to replenish the country’s coffers for its fight against Russia”.\nDavos has already hosted a high-level meeting to discuss peace in Ukraine, but these talks – which don’t involve Russia - ended without a significant resolution.\nUrsula von der Leyen will also address delegates today, as will China’s premier, Li Qiang.\nQiang is leading a large government delegation to this year’s World Economic Forum. Yesterday Qiang met with Swiss President Viola Amherd, with the pair signing a joint declaration to deepen bilateral ties and bolster an existing free trade agreement.\nThe Middle East crisis is also a growing concern for leaders here in Davos, with UK foreign secretary David Cameron warning last weekend that the ‘lights are absolutely flashing red’ on the global dashboard. He’s also visiting Davos this week.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, gives a speech later in the day.\nKaren Harris, partner at Bain & Company, says the the “critical macro question for discussion at Davos” is whether the last four years will be remembered as a period of great disruption, or the start of a great divergence.\nHarris explains:\n\n“If disruption is the correct lens for interpreting our recent history, then 2024 and beyond will transition to a level of blandness compared to the last few years, which will be a relief for leaders and markets. Rebuilding and re-normalization will be prevailing themes of this scenario.\n“But suppose 2020-2023 was not a disruption, but rather the moment of a historical divergence—a branching point when the larger arc of mega themes and trends took a steep turn. If this lens (divergence) turns out to be correct, then the loop of volatile events triggering volatile reactions resumes in 2024; the shaking of the world resumes and likely continues even beyond this year.\n\nThe agenda\n\n8.15am CET / 7.15am GMT: A panel discussion on high interest rates, including Gita Gopinath, First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, and François Villeroy de Galhau,governor of the Central Bank of France.\n8.15am CET / 7.15am GMT: A panel discussion on whether generative AI is the Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?\n9.45am CET / 8.45am GMT: A Conversation with Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar\n10.50am CET / 9.50am CET: Special Address by Li Qiang, Premier of the People’s Republic of China\n11.20am CET / 10.20am GMT: Special Address by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission\n1pm CET / Noon GMT: Securing an Insecure World, including Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO\n2.15pm CET / 1.15pm GMT: Special address by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, President of Ukraine\n4.30pm CET / 3.30pm GMT: A Conversation with Microsoft SEO Satya Nadella and Klaus Schwab, founder of WEF\n5pm CET / 4pm GMT: Special address by Jake Sullivan, US National Security Advisor\n5.30pm CET / 4.30pm GMT: A Conversation with Bisher Hani Al Khasawneh, prime minister of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\n5.30pm CET / 4.30pm GMT: A panel discussion on Industrial Policy 2.0, including Jonathan Reynolds, Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Trade.\n6.45pm CET / 5.45pm GMT: Chief Economists Briefing,\n\n\nUpdated at 9.04am GMT\n"

        "content": "Staff at Fujitsu, the technology firm at the centre of the Post Office Horizon scandal, are due to go on strike tomorrow, which their trade union said could disrupt HM Revenue and Customs at the busiest time of year for tax collection. About 300 staff, most of whom work in IT support for HMRC at sites in Telford and Stratford, east London, will go on strike in protest at a pay offer that the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said was 10 times less than what Fujitsu is offering staff in Japan. The PCS said Fujitsu staff involved in fixing and protecting HMRC computers would take further action between 18 January and 15 February. HMRC is understood to be confident that industrial action would not affect its ability to process self-assessment tax returns in the busy weeks before the 31 January deadline. However, the PCS said it believed the strike was “likely to disrupt those seeking to complete their self-assessment tax returns by the end of the month”. The union said the strike had nothing to do with the faulty Horizon IT system, which produced incorrect data that the Post Office used to wrongly accuse thousands of postmasters of theft and fraud. That scandal is expected to cost taxpayers at least £1bn in compensation and Fujitsu said on Tuesday it bore moral responsibility to contribute financially. The company has defended its continued role in government contracts, including for the Ministry of Defence and HMRC. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “Why is the UK government giving Fujitsu lucrative contracts when the company treats its UK workers so badly? “Why is it workers in Japan are deemed worthy of a pay rise almost 10 times more than those in the UK? “Fujitsu made £22m profit last year in the UK, so it can afford to pay our members a decent wage – it just chooses not to. Fujitsu said: “We remain committed to continue pay talks to try to resolve this situation and welcome further discussions at any time. “Fujitsu will be taking all necessary steps to ensure operational continuity for all our customers and are working closely with those customers throughout the planning process.” An HMRC spokesperson said: “We have robust plans in place to ensure we continue delivering critical services for our customers during any industrial action.”"

        "content": "BT has become the first major telecoms company to scrap controversial above-inflation price rises for mobile and broadband customers – but not before pushing through a final increase this year. The owner of mobile operator EE has moved to address the pressure on consumers from rising household costs during the cost of living crisis, after telecoms companies were criticised for increasing bills. The UK’s largest mobile and broadband companies were accused of fuelling “greedflation” after a Guardian investigation last year found they were pushing through above-inflation price rises. EE said customers will now be told clearly in “pounds and pence” the planned increase to their monthly bill from next year. The move comes a day before the official inflation figure for December is revealed, which most operators use to set their mid-contract price increases for customers. Analysts have estimated that this year’s round of price rises will add almost £500m to consumers’ collective bills from spring. BT, Vodafone, Virgin Media O2 and TalkTalk all use a version of the mechanism, which usually takes the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation plus about 3.9%. However, Virgin Media O2 uses the higher figure of retail price inflation (RPI) taken from the rate published for January. Last year, most mobile and broadband tariffs rose by 14.4%, although Virgin Media O2 customers faced a 17.3% rise, based on December 2022’s CPI figure of 10.5% and January 2023’s RPI at 13.4%. This year the expectations are that December CPI will be about 4% with January’s RPI forecast to be in the range of 6.5%. The move, which comes months before a ban from the telecoms regulator Ofcom on companies imposing inflation-linked price rises in the middle of a contract, will put pressure on BT’s rivals that use the practice to follow suit. “Our annual price change is never an easy conversation to have with customers, particularly when so many people are dealing with the cost of living crisis,” said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT group’s consumer division. “We’re listening, and we’ve taken this on board. [We will] instead offer a clear and simple view of any changes in ‘pounds and pence’.” BT said that in 2025 mobile customers can expect a monthly increase from £1.50, and broadband customers from £3, depending on the specific contract they are on. Research by the consumer group Which? Estimates that telecoms firms will generate £488m from this year’s mid-contract prices rises. The practice is not allowed in other utility sectors such as electricity and gas. “This is a smart move from BT, anticipating the likely ban on inflation-linked pricing after Ofcom opened a consultation into the controversial practice late last year,” said Kester Mann, director, consumer and connectivity at CCS Insight.  “It gives the operator a short window to promote a clearer and more transparent approach compared to its rivals before most other operators inevitably follow suit.”"

        "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has made an impassioned plea for international support for his country’s war against Russia, insisting that Vladimir Putin must live to regret starting the conflict almost two years ago. In a speech that received a standing ovation from the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Ukrainian president said the Putin had stolen 13 years of peace and would only respond to military defeat. “If anybody thinks this is just about Ukraine they are fundamentally mistaken,” Zelenskiy said, after a meeting in Davos with 70 chief executives and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Dressed in his trademark black jumper, Zelenskiy said the Russian leader was spurred on to take military action by warnings to Ukraine not to escalate a conflict that began with the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. “Every ‘do not escalate’ sounded like ‘you will prevail’ to Putin. Because of ‘don’t escalate’, lives were lost,” Zelenskiy said. “One man has stolen at least 13 years of peace, replacing them with pain, pain, pain and crisis that impact the entire world.” Zelenskiy had earlier received strong support from von der Leyen, who said Putin had failed militarily, economically and diplomatically. “Ukraine can prevail in this war but we must continue to empower their resistance,” von der Leyen said in her keynote address. “Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory.” Ukraine has begun accession talks to join the European Union, a move supported in Brussels. “EU membership will be Ukraine’s historic achievement,” she said. In previous years, Zelenskiy has spoken at Davos by video link and his decision to appear in person this year reflects concern in Kyiv that the west has grown weary of the war. He challenged the idea that peace was possible were the conflict to be frozen with Russia still occupying large chunks of eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said he doubted that “freezing the war in Ukraine” would actually end the conflict. After 2014, there were attempts to freeze the war in Donbas, but that did not sate Russia’s appetite. “Putin is a predator who is not satisfied by frozen products,” he said. “We have to defend ourselves. We can beat him on the ground, in the air and at sea – and we have proved it,” he added. “Putin must regret it [the war]. We need him to lose. Global unity is stronger than one man’s hatred,” he said. Ukraine’s president also stressed the need to tighten economic sanctions on Russia to hobble its arms industry. “In every Russian missile there are critical components from western countries.” Zelenskiy made a pitch for the chief executives in Davos to provide the investment necessary to rebuild Ukraine’s war ravaged economy. “Strengthen our economy and we will strengthen your security,” he said. “The more money Putin and his allies lose, the more he will regret this war,” Zelenskiy added. “We need to finally dispel the illusion that global unity is weaker than one man’s hatred.” Attempts by the US president, Joe Biden, to provide $60bn of additional aid to Ukraine has so far been frustrated by Republicans in the Senate but Zelenskiy said he was confident the impasse would end within weeks and that he would receive fresh supplies of military hardware. Chris Coons, US senator for Delaware, attended Zelenskiy’s meeting with CEOs at the World Economic Forum, and said the mood was “upbeat, determined, positive”.“He [Zelenskiy] urged that we remain as determined as the Ukrainian people and that we see this through,” said Coons, who was wearing a badge showing the US and Ukrainian flags.There were “a number” of bankers in attendance, including Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, as well as the CEOs of fertiliser producer Yara and of YouTube, who talked about efforts to take down Russian disinformation and malign content, Coons said."

        "content": "UK private sector wages rose in November by almost double the pre-pandemic rate – 6.5% compared with 3.8% – and yet the Bank of England is expected to consider the outlook for employment to be weak enough in the coming months to justify interest rate cuts. The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) meets next month to judge the health of the economy and whether interest rates at 5.25% are too much of a dead weight on households and companies. It is a strange situation for the central bank to find itself in. In the US, the Federal Reserve is under similar pressure to cut borrowing costs, but that might seem more understandable in a country where wage growth has tumbled. The same situation applies on the continent, where the European Central Bank has never had a UK-style increase in wages.   Related: UK pay growth slows as inflation pressure weakens   Adding to the confusion is the huge variation in pay across various sectors. This is especially true in the private sector, which is most closely watched by the Bank as a barometer of the economy’s health. Average weekly earnings including bonuses across the hospitality sector, including restaurants, hotels and bars, have risen 19.6% since January 2020, from £368 a week to £440, while inflation has grown by 21.7%. Meanwhile, wages have jumped from £699 a week in the financial and business services sector to £901 a week – a 29% increase since January 2020. Both sectors experienced wages growth of 7% or more in November, while construction workers were held to just 4.5%. The Bank of England believes annual wage rises should be about 3% to maintain a steady rate of inflation at 2%. Any higher, and wages would pressure on prices and push inflation up again. So it is legitimate to ask why the Bank would consider cutting borrowing costs this year. Surely the wages data reflects a high demand for workers, which in turn shows the economy is running too hot and needs to be calmed down with higher, not lower, interest rates. Until recently that was the view of three members of the nine-strong MPC, who voted for higher borrowing costs at the December meeting while their colleagues voted for a freeze. In February one or two of the rebels are expected to reverse their position now wages are falling by more than the MPC’s 7.2% forecast for November. The key to unlocking the next MPC vote is to look at where wages are going next. Hannah Slaughter, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the data showed 2023 was “a year of two halves for pay packets, with strong growth in the first six months of the year, and barely any growth at all after the summer”. She added: “This means that annual pay growth will continue to fall in early 2024 – and is no longer fuelling inflation.” Financial markets expect this trend to mean five interest rate cuts this year, from 5.25% to below 4%. Whether all five happen this year hangs in the balance. But several cuts starting in May look increasingly likely."

        "content": "The man who launched Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine in the UK three years ago – when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan in Coventry became the first person in the world to receive one – is now overseeing the construction of a manufacturing and research centre in Oxfordshire for rival US jab maker Moderna. The company’s Harwell site is Britain’s first centre dedicated to the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against new Covid variants and other illnesses, and part of the UK’s “100 days mission” initiative – the ambition for governments to be able to respond to future pandemics within 100 days of a threat being identified.  Moderna and others are using mRNA – which teaches cells how to make a specific protein that triggers the body’s immune response against disease – to develop therapies for various conditions, including cancer, HIV, norovirus and rare diseases, particularly those in children. Darius Hughes, who trained as a pharmacist and worked for Pfizer for 17 years before being poached by Moderna in 2021 to set up its UK operation as general manager, says: “The flexibility of the messenger RNA platform means that within about 100 days of any mutation, we can have a vaccine reformulated and on the market ready for vaccination into people. That’s a lot quicker than a traditional vaccines platform.” With Moderna working on combined flu and Covid shots, he says, “the Department of Health can come to us and request a specific UK mix for UK patients. We can combine a lot of messenger RNAs together so that you can make it very simple for the NHS to deliver.” Moderna developed one of the world’s first two Covid jabs based on mRNA during the pandemic – Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech were behind the other – and both were quick to adapt their shots to the Omicron variants in 2022. However, the virus remains a problem for the NHS, which has come under pressure in recent weeks from a surge in the number of Covid and flu admissions to ­hospital. Nevertheless, Covid shots are now only given by the NHS to over-65s, those with underlying health conditions, health workers and carers. Moderna plans to make its Covid jab available privately in the UK later this year. It is expected to cost between £50 and £100 – versus £9 to £20 for a flu shot – but pharmacies and private clinics will set their own price, Hughes says. The company’s Spikevax jab can already be bought over the counter in the US for about $120 (£100). Pfizer is also exploring selling its Comirnaty Covid jab privately in the UK. Moderna is also focusing its mRNA knowhow on rare diseases in children and personalised cancer vaccines. “In rare diseases, what we’re doing is an intravenous injection,” says Hughes. “We are putting in some messages there that help the body to produce a protein that is missing in the children.” The illnesses targeted include inherited metabolic disorders in which the body cannot break down certain proteins and fats. In skin cancer cases, Moderna takes a part of the tumour cells that have been cut out during surgery, sequences the patient’s DNA and makes mRNA signals. These are injected into the body and tell the body to produce antibodies to attack the cancer cells. “Unlike normal cancer therapy, which kills everything fairly indiscriminately, these are like targeted missiles,” says Hughes.  Bigger late-stage clinical trials led by Moderna’s partner Merck (known as MSD outside the US) are beginning in the UK and elsewhere, and according to Moderna the vaccine could be launched under accelerated approval in some countries by 2025. Another late-stage trial for non-small-cell lung cancer is also under way. Moderna hopes to launch a combined flu and Covid vaccine next year, followed in 2026 by a ­triple shot including not only flu and Covid but also respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe illness and hospitalisation in children and older people. The company has submitted a new RSV vaccine for regulatory approval, but is lagging behind UK rival GSK and Pfizer, whose RSV vaccines are already on the market. Meanwhile, a recent Sanofi and AstraZeneca trial indicated its jab could cut RSV hospital admissions of babies and young children by 80%. Harwell will be Moderna’s biggest base outside the US: the lab is already in place and will open later this year. About 150 people will work at the site, including 50 scientists. The factory is expected to produce up to 100m vaccine doses a year from 2025, which could be ramped up to 250m doses by running three shifts a day, seven days a week, if there were another pandemic – “plenty for the UK and beyond”, Hughes says. He describes himself as a “failed doctor”, having been good at science and maths at school in his home town of Poole in Dorset but failing to get the grades for medical school. In the end he “loved” studying pharmacy at Portsmouth University. After a six-month stint in the NHS, he worked for Boots for 15 years and then joined the pharmaceutical industry, with various roles at Pfizer, including a two-year spell in Paris and seven years running the UK and Ireland vaccines division. After delivering 15m Covid shots for Pfizer in the early part of 2021, Hughes was exhausted, having worked long hours, seven days a week, for a year. So when he received a call from Moderna asking him to be their first commercial employee in the UK, he was ready for a change. While looking promising, personalised cancer vaccines throw up challenges with clinical trials and regulatory approval because they are “individual to a particular person” – but Hughes believes they are the future. “Medicine is going personalised, and it’s not just in vaccines and in cancer,” he says. “We’re going to have to be at the forefront of this.” He says the government did not offer any incentives in return for Moderna establishing Britain’s first mRNA vaccine hub. However, the UK has committed to buying Moderna’s therapies over the next decade and ordered 60m doses of its Covid vaccine in December 2021; a tranche of these are being delivered during the current booster campaign. Globally, Moderna has delivered more than 1bn doses of its Covid vaccine – its only commercial product – but has been criticised for its high pricing, which resulted in sales of $18.4bn in 2022. They have since declined, to $6.7bn last year after the US declared the pandemic over, and are predicted to fall to $4bn this year. The firm wrote down unused doses and made a $4bn loss before tax in the nine months to 30 September. Its goal is to break even in 2026. As part of its 10-year partnership with the government, Moderna is building up a UK supply chain, including vials and needles, to ensure Britain is prepared for the next pandemic. The company has launched 17 clinical trials in the UK since 2021, including Covid, flu and RSV studies, and more trials for rare diseases and combination vaccines are planned to take place in Britain. One of Moderna’s investors is the hedge fund Thélème Partners, of which Rishi Sunak was a founding partner, before quitting in 2013 to go into politics. It is unclear whether he retains a stake in the fund. “We are not privy to information about individuals who have contributed into the Thélème hedge fund,” Moderna says.

        "content": "Avanti West Coast managers joked about receiving “free money” from government and performance-related payments being “too good to be true” in an internal presentation at the notoriously unreliable train operator, it has emerged. One slide, entitled “Roll up, roll-up get your free money here!” described how the Treasury and Department for Transport supported the firm with taxpayers’ money, provided third-party suppliers and inspections, and then paid Avanti fees on top. The RMT union labelled the presentation, made last week by senior managers, a “disgrace”. The firm, a joint venture between First Group and TrenItalia, was awarded a new long-term contract last year by the government to run Britain’s major intercity service despite a poor record of cancelled and late-running trains. It slashed timetables in December and has seen punctuality decline and cancellations worsen in recent months. Avanti confirmed the contents of the presentation but described the wording, in slides seen by the Guardian and first reported in Novara Media, as “regrettable”. The meeting was attended and partially addressed by Avanti’s directors, including its managing director, Andy Mellors, but it is understood he did not present the “free money” slides. Since the end of franchising, train operators are paid a management fee by the government to run services and do not rely on selling more tickets – or running trains during strikes – for profits, and can earn higher contractual payments by meeting performance targets. The presentation was describing the Service Quality Regime (SQR), which inspects station and train functioning, and cleanliness as well as customer service. It concluded that, even with only partial compliance: “And here’s the fantastic thing! – if we achieve those figures, they pay us some more money – which is ours to keep – in the form of a performance-based fee!! Sound too good to be true?! Well on this occasion it isn’t – it’s the absolute truth!” Under current performance, Avanti was on course to get payouts for customer service but not for its running of trains or stations. An Avanti West Coast spokesperson said: “This does not represent Avanti West Coast’s view of the Service Quality Regime and was an isolated incident. These slides were an attempt to explain how the SQR works to some of our colleagues, but the language used in this was regrettable and we apologise. “The Service Quality Regime is a robust and independent audit which we take very seriously. It has been demonstrated to hold us to account to drive up standards as we strive to continually improve our customer service.” The latest embarrassment for Avanti comes amid continuing strikes and plummeting staff morale. The presentation showed fewer than one in five employees felt positive about working for Avanti. A fuller version of the employee survey, seen by the Guardian in December, showed only 3% said they felt valued, and only one in five agreed that the firm was “committed to delivering good service for its customers”. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “Avanti is one of the worst rail companies in terms of performance and how it treats rail staff. For senior management to produce a PowerPoint slide bragging about the government paying them public money is a disgrace. “The government has the mandate over Avanti and should never have given them a long-term nine-year contract award. The fact the company feels emboldened to boast that they get ‘free money’ is down to the ridiculous system of rail ownership in this country. Ultimately, profit-driven companies who receive huge public subsidies have failed to deliver for railway workers and passengers alike.”"

        "content": "Governments are failing to properly tackle the scourge of slavery and human trafficking even as it increases, the former UK prime minister Theresa May has said. Modern slavery is “slipping down the agenda” among world leaders, she told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “We’ve seen in recent years the number of people in slavery increasing around the world,” she said. “Conflict, the pandemic, the impact of climate change increase vulnerability to it. At the same time governments are taking their attention off it.” May, who heads the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, was speaking at an event on modern slavery at the Swiss ski resort alongside Princess Eugenie, who co-founded the Anti-Slavery Collective in 2017. “Guns and drugs can be only trafficked once but human beings are trafficked again and again and again,” Eugenie said. “For them it happens every day and minute.” May said companies “need to really pay attention to supply chains” and governments should set tighter laws. Intergovernmental organisations such as the G7 and G20 also need to take the problem seriously and have it on their agendas, she said. May, who was home secretary between 2010 and 2016 and prime minister between 2016 and 2019, said modern slavery is hard to spot. “Go out on to the streets [and] most people tell you it was eradicated 100 years ago. Sadly it is not. There are people probably not that far from where we are today who are in slavery,” she added. José Manuel Barroso, a former European Commission president who heads the board of Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, said increasing migration will move modern slavery higher up the agenda. “This is something that is real and it deserves more attention,” he said. John Schultz, the chief operating officer at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, said the biggest problem is that modern slavery is an “out of sight, out of mind” issue. “We have to get this issue back up to the boards of directors and CEOs where they view it as a top priority,” he added. Eugenie founded the Anti-Slavery Collective with her friend Julia de Boinville to raise awareness of the estimated 50 million people in modern slavery around the world."

        "published_date": "2024-01-16T12:52:07+00:00",
        "content": "Pay growth in the UK slowed more than expected in November, in a sign that inflationary pressures have weakened more than the Bank of England was expecting when it issued its latest forecasts. Average pay growth was 6.5% in November, down from 7.2% in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the UK jobs market weakened in response to high interest rates and stagnation across much of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected total average earnings of 6.8% in November. Job vacancies tumbled at the fastest rate on record in December, the ONS said, in a further sign the UK labour market was now cooling.   Related: AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality, says IMF head   The ONS said despite the drop in wages growth, recent falls in inflation meant real wages grew for the fifth month in a row, easing the pressure on household disposable incomes. It added that overall, the jobs market remained stable with employment down only marginally and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. The pound fell after the weaker than expected wage data prompted traders to raise bets that the Bank of England would start cutting interest rates in the spring. Sterling was down by 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2642. The central bank is expected to re-examine its outlook for the economy when officials meet next month. Most analysts expect the Bank’s monetary policy committee to hint at several interest rate cuts this year after acknowledging the weakening labour market and recent falls in inflation as indications of further stagnation. James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING, said it was probably a little early to expect a major change of direction by the Bank, “but recent data could lay the groundwork for a May cut as long as it continues to comply”. He added: “The bottom line is that both wage growth and services inflation, the datasets that are guiding monetary policy right now, are below Bank of England projections.” Financial markets expect five interest rate cuts this year by the Bank, taking interest down from 5.25% to below 4%. One of the Bank’s key barometers, regular private sector pay growth, dropped further from a revised 7.2% in October (7.3% previously) to 6.5% in November, leaving it comfortably below the Bank’s prediction for it to still be at 7.2% in December. Falling energy and fuel prices and the slowing economy have brought the headline rate of inflation down from 4.6% in October to 3.9% in November and are expected to exert further downward pressure in December when figures are released tomorrow. Samual Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was likely to be some concern inside the Bank that the steady picture for employment showed much of the jobs market remained tight, limiting further falls in wages and vacancies. The number of vacancies soared during the Covid pandemic as many older workers took early retirement, the number of workers signed off sick increased and younger workers opted to go back into education, but the ONS said vacancies fell for the 18th consecutive month in the three months to December, by 49,000 to 934,000. Analysts have also become increasingly concerned about recent global shocks from conflict in the Middle East that could harm trade and push shop prices back up again. The ONS figures on Tuesday showed that workers in the private and public sectors received almost the same level of pay rise, including bonuses, up by 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively, in the three months to November. In the private sector, restaurants, hotels and retailers offered the biggest pay rises of 7.2% on average, followed by City and finance workers, who received 7% on average. Construction workers were at the bottom of the pay league table with rises averaging 4.5%, reflecting the severe downturn across the building industry. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: “It has been tough for many families recently, but with inflation now falling and the economy gradually returning to growth today’s continuing rise in real wages will offer further relief. “On top of this the cut in national insurance contributions will get more people back into the jobs market, not just supporting economic growth but saving a typical two-earner household about £1,000 this year.”"

        "content": "Ocado’s retail arm returned to the black last year as customers had more Marks & Spencer food options and shoppers switched back to online grocery shopping after a post-pandemic slump. The group, a joint venture between M&S and the technology company Ocado Group, said price matching with Tesco and better service had also helped increase sales, while the closure of an old warehouse helped cut costs. More efficient ways of working, including new robotic picking arms and the opening of a hi-tech warehouse, have kept costs down, with Ocado requiring just 10 minutes of human labour to pick a 50-item order compared with more than an hour for supermarkets that fulfil online orders from stores.   Related: Supermarkets agree to accept smaller veg from rain-soaked UK farms   Sales rose by almost 11% to £609.4m in the three months to 26 November, the fourth quarter of growth and a step up from the previous three-month rate of 7.2%. Growth was helped by a 5.4% increase in average selling prices but the number of items sold also rose, by 4.8%, as Ocado attracted more shoppers and the number of items bought by each shopper remained roughly stable – down just under 1%. The strong end to the year helped lift annual sales by 7% to £2.4bn as Ocado Retail said it had increased its share of the online grocery market to 12.7% and was now profitable. Details on profits will not be released until next month alongside figures for its co-parent Ocado Group. The figures came after a “challenging year” in 2022 when the retail arm sank £4m into the red as customers put fewer items in their baskets and used more discount vouchers during the cost of living crisis. Ocado Group dived to a £500m loss that year. Ocado expects sales growth to rise by a similar level in the year ahead – in line with City expectations – as easing food price inflation offsets higher growth in the volume of items sold. The Ocado Retail chief executive, Hannah Gibson, said the group expected profits to increase in the year ahead after a strong Christmas. “More people had people around for dinners,” she added. She said while some traditional snacks such as pigs in blankets sold well year on year there were also signs that shoppers were “doing things differently”. They bought more beef centrepieces instead of turkey and chocolate pudding instead of traditional Christmas pudding as they were “exploring more of the range” on offer at Ocado. Gibson said: “We made significant progress in 2023. We have focused first and foremost on being a great shopkeeper, improving our unbeatable range, great value and unrivalled experience – all underpinned by improved cost efficiencies.” She said the shoppers’ behaviour had returned to normal after the Covid lockdowns, when there was a massive shift to online shopping followed by a big drop back. “We are beginning to get back to structural growth in online grocery. We are already beginning to see online outpace [in store shopping] and we expect that shift to continue,” she added. Ocado paused plans to open new warehouses last year, and Gibson said the group did not expect to open or close sites in the near future as it focused on getting the most out of its existing facilities, introducing further automation. Ocado shares were up more than 7% on Tuesday morning, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100."

        "content": "Shell’s board faces a shareholder rebellion as large investors including the UK’s biggest pension scheme prepare to back a climate activist resolution. Twenty-seven investors have agreed to back a resolution filed by the Dutch shareholder activists at Follow This that calls for the oil company to align its medium-term emissions reduction targets with the 2015 Paris agreement. The investor coalition together owns about 5% of Shell’s shares and includes the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), which manages the pensions of almost a quarter of the UK’s workers. The resolution has also won the backing of the French asset management firm Amundi, which holds almost €2tn (£1.7tn) in assets, as well as Candriam, Scottish Widows, and Rathbones Group. Diandra Soobiah, the head of responsible investment at Nest, said: “We urge Shell to set a credible scope 3 absolute emissions target. This would demonstrate leadership, show Shell is serious about transitioning its business, and play a role in generating real world change.” “Scope 3” emissions include all greenhouse gas emissions that companies do not either generate directly or purchase for their own energy needs. This extends to everything from raw materials used to create a product to the transportation that delivers that product to a consumer. Shareholders will be asked to vote on the resolution at the £160bn company’s annual general meeting in May. The resolution has already received the backing of investors who together hold about €4tn in assets under management, and support is expected to grow over the months before Shell’s annual general meeting, according to Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This. Van Baal said: “This escalation of 27 leading investors puts the call for emissions reductions by energy companies front and centre for all institutional investors.” Follow This has gained support for its climate campaign in recent years, although the group has yet to win a majority vote in favour of its resolutions. Its latest shareholder resolution has dropped a reference to 2030 in response to criticism from Shell that its demands are too proscriptive. Shell is expected to face growing opposition from ethical investors and climate activists after abandoning its plans to reduce its oil and gas production before the end of the decade. The company’s AGM in London last year descended into chaos as climate protests delayed the start of the meeting by an hour, after the board rejected shareholder calls for new targets for carbon emissions cuts. A Shell spokesperson said: “The 2024 resolution from Follow This is broadly unchanged from their 2023 submission, which was rejected by shareholders (as its variations have been every year since first being submitted in 2016). “Shell’s board has previously advised shareholders that the Follow This resolution was unrealistic and simplistic, that it would have no impact on mitigating climate change, have negative consequences for our customers, and was against the interests of the company and our shareholders.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-15T19:41:26+00:00",
        "content": "The role played by the technology firm Fujitsu in the Post Office Horizon scandal will come under the microscope this week, with the judge-led inquiry and a committee of MPs due to question company employees at separate hearings on Tuesday. It was not Fujitsu that relentlessly pursued thousands of local branch owner-operators, falsely accusing them of theft and fraud even after it became clear that the Horizon IT system was producing incorrect data. That was the Post Office. But the Japanese technology company built the ill-fated system, under a contract that has since been extended to run until 2025, reaching a lifetime value of £2.4bn. It also supported the Post Office in its pursuit of more than 900 post office operators, providing expert witnesses for private prosecutions of innocent branch owner-operators, many of whom were jailed. After the ITV dramatisation of the scandal brought it back into the headlines and helped prompt government moves to quash all related convictions, this week could be the first time that Fujitsu has been called to account in any meaningful way at the inquiry and a special hearing of the business select committee announced last week. Here’s what they might be asked. What did Fujitsu bosses know and when? MPs at Tuesday’s select committee hearing will interrogate what Fujitsu and the Post Office knew about flaws in the Horizon system and how early they knew it. The inquiry has heard that the Post Office was aware of problems with the Horizon system at least as early as 1999. Fujitsu’s UK boss, Paul Patterson, is scheduled to give evidence to MPs, who will try to drill down into the timeline of corporate culpability. Patterson’s immediate predecessor, Duncan Tait, was handed a £2.6m payoff when he left the company in 2019, the Guardian revealed last week. MPs might ask about the terms of that payment. They could also seek clarity on whether it was Tait who made the now infamous comment, according to previous testimony by the former Post Office boss Paula Vennells, that Horizon was like “Fort Knox”, the US military base that is often conflated with the heavily guarded gold bullion depository nearby. Did Fujitsu contribute to wrongful prosecutions? At the judge-led inquiry, Fujitsu staff are due to give evidence about the company’s role in the various legal battles between the Post Office and victims of the Horizon scandal. Liam Byrne, one of the MPs on the business select committee, told the Guardian: “It’s high time Fujitsu broke their vow of silence about whether they put profit before people and stayed silent about Horizon’s problems when their evidence was being used to send innocent people to prison.” Four former Fujitsu employees who advised the Post Office on the Horizon system, including during prosecutions, will give evidence this week. MPs will be keen to quiz them on the role of Gareth Jenkins, the former chief architect at Fujitsu, who gave evidence defending the Horizon computer system in a number of the prosecutions. Should Fujitsu pay compensation? Calls have been growing for Fujitsu to contribute to compensation payments for Horizon victims, a bill that could reach £1bn, funded by taxpayers. This is likely to be one of the key targets for MPs on the select committee, particularly given that Fujitsu has yet to face any consequences, financial or contractual, for its flawed work for the Post Office. The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, has suggested Fujitsu could be forced to cough up if the inquiry finds it was at fault. MPs will question Patterson on whether Fujitsu expects any such claim from either the Post Office or the government and how it would react. “How much is Fujitsu going to pay towards the […] compensation now owed because their system malfunctioned so badly that innocent lives were destroyed,” said Byrne. Should Fujitsu be winning government contracts? Fujitsu has won nearly 200 public sector contracts worth £6.78bn, according to analysis by the procurement experts Tussell. As government officials began to realise the full horror of the Horizon scandal, they sought in vain to exclude Fujitsu from tendering for public contracts under the dubiously titled “Project Sushi”, the Financial Times reported on Monday. The Post Office also sought advice from a big consultancy firm in 2012 on how to extricate itself from the Horizon contract, a well-placed source told the Guardian. It didn’t work. The £2.4bn Horizon contract is still going and other contracts with government bodies including the Ministry of Defence and a £1bn deal with HM Revenue and Customs. The latter will come into sharp focus later this week because Fujitsu staff at HMRC are due to go on strike over pay. That could leave HMRC struggling for capacity, just at the peak time of year for tax returns being filed. Fujitsu and the Post Office have both repeatedly said that they would support the inquiry but were unable to comment while it was ongoing. • This article was amended on 16 January 2024. An earlier version said the Post Office first became aware of Horizon deficiencies in 2010. The inquiry has heard it knew of problems from at least 1999."

        "content": "Growing concern that heightened geopolitical tension could damage an already shaky global economy has dominated the start of the annual gathering of the world’s business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland. Three potential flash points – Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan – threatened to overshadow the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) aimed at rebuilding trust after the series of setbacks suffered in the past four years, including war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Meanwhile, a study of global business leaders to mark the start of the gathering in the Swiss mountain resort showed UK chief executives embracing generative artificial intelligence more rapidly than their peers in other countries. France’s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are all scheduled to address the WEF this week, as is Argentina’s new president Javier Milei. With Middle East tensions rising, the US is sending its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the its national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Davos. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, is also attending, as are the prime ministers of Iraq, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and Jordan, Bisher al-Khasawneh, and Iran’s minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves, are both speaking at this year’s event. Hunt’s predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is also attending. Artificial intelligence will dominate Davos, with OpenAI’s Sam Altman due to appear on a panel. AI is seen by its proponents as a possible way of boosting growth, but the WEF said in last week’s global risks report that it could be misused by hostile states and other malign forces. Interviewed by CNBC, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that without measures to shape its use AI would lead to greater inequality. She said: “It’s arriving – do not close your eyes or put your head in the sand. AI requires preparation.” In its annual survey of chief executives, the accountancy firm PwC said almost half (42%) of those running UK companies had implemented the new technology in the past year, compared with 32% in other countries. The survey of 4,702 CEOs in 105 countries found the UK was one of the frontrunners in adopting the generative AI that runs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators such as Midjourney. Only 9% of German chief executives and 20% of French CEOs had adopted GenAI, along with 38% of US CEOs and 25% of China’s CEOs. Only Norway, (53%), Japan (50%) and Finland (49%) had been faster. Kevin Ellis, a senior partner at PwC UK, said: “After an uphill trek against economic headwinds, UK chief execs are seeking gamechanging opportunities. GenAI presents a ‘move or lose’ moment – implemented with care, it offers huge benefits for efficiency, competitiveness and ultimately profitability. “The UK’s service-based economy makes it ideally placed for the GenAI revolution – building tech is only half the battle, ensuring people and businesses can use it is key.” The PwC survey found UK chief executives upbeat about the prospects for the global economy, with 61% expecting it to improve this year – a threefold increase on the poll conducted in 2023. After almost two years in which the economy has moved sideways, UK business leaders were markedly less confident about the prospects for the UK than they were about the global economy. Only 39% expected it to improve in 2024, although PwC said this was up from 9% a year ago. At the Davos opening ceremony on Monday night, the WEF presented its annual crystal awards to architect and educator Diébédo Francis Kéré, the Oscar-winning actor Michelle Yeoh, and the musician and producer Nile Rodgers. Yeoh, star of many hit films including Tomorrow Never Dies; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and Everything Everywhere All At Once, was recognised for her work raising awareness and mobilising support for the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, and for promoting sustainable fashion, disaster-preparedness and road safety. Kéré received the award for “his exemplary leadership” helping Burkina Faso’s Gando community create a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable future through projects that focus on education, health and the environment. The WEF also recognised Rodgers’ humanitarian work, including fighting systemic racism, inequality and injustice, championing young people, and co-founding the We Are Family Foundation to promote cultural diversity after 9/11."

        "content": "In the space of a year, Reach, the owner of the Mirror, Express and hundreds of local newspapers, has parted ways with the two most senior members of its editorial leadership team and cut almost 800 roles in the biggest annual cull of jobs in the newspaper industry for decades. On Monday, Reach confirmed the departure by mutual agreement of Alison Phillips, a 26-year company veteran who was the Daily Mirror’s first female editor since it was founded in 1903, reigniting fears among staff that the pre-Christmas jobs cull will continue this year. The highly respected Phillips follows in the footsteps of Lloyd Embley, who abruptly departed as group editor-in-chief with immediate effect last summer, shearing one of the UK’s leading national titles of its two most senior and stalwart editorial defenders, as well as plunging the newspaper group further into crisis. Kevin Maguire, an associate editor at the Mirror, summed up the internal despondency at the newspaper, posting on X that Phillips was the “first editor in my 40 years whose departure will be mourned by the entire newsroom”.  Inspiring, courageous, principled, decent and caring, @MirrorAlison is the first editor in my 40 years whose departure will be mourned by the entire newsroom. https://t.co/RRmvzx4KvL— Kevin Maguire (@Kevin_Maguire) January 14, 2024  “Everyone is reeling,” said one longtime staffer. “Everyone is saying the same thing. We are done. There is no real faith in the direction and support for the title. There is a lot of despondency. I have been here a long time and I have never seen staff morale so low.” Meanwhile, the consultation period on 450 job cuts announced last November ended just days earlier. It was the third in less than a year, which staff had hoped might mark a hiatus in a seemingly inexorable series of redundancies at the UK’s largest commercial news publisher. Reach owns more than 130 newspapers and websites across the UK including the Daily Star, the Daily Record, the Manchester Evening News and the Liverpool Echo. However, Jim Mullen, the embattled chief executive of Reach, has already refused to rule out the possibility of more cuts and while Phillips’s departure is not part of the voluntary redundancy (VR) programme, many feel that other long-serving staff may go next. Sources said that after the cuts announcement in November, Phillips tried to intervene to get some applicants to the VR scheme to stay. “Her attitude was all about the Mirror, she wanted to keep a core together, now she is gone,” said a second source. “If you start going down the newsroom list of senior figures with similar tenure there are other names now doing the rounds who could be earmarked for departure next. Alison and Lloyd were the biggest in terms of who people know, and certainly in terms of cost to the company, but people are now back on edge immediately thinking there is more to come.” Reach has parachuted in on an interim basis Caroline Waterston, the editor-in-chief for the company’s magazines and supplements, including the celebrity title OK! magazine. Mullen highlighted Waterston’s “track record leading our magazines through a major digital shift”. However, insiders are concerned about the increasingly diminished status of the UK’s only left-leaning tabloid. “At a national level, the Labour party and trade union movement are in danger of losing the Mirror, the only left-of-centre newspaper and website aimed at working class readers,” said a third source. “On the right, the Express is perhaps less important than the Mail and Telegraph, but the Conservatives face losing a still important backer.” Reach’s network of more than 130 national and regional websites have long been criticised by readers for being overloaded with advertising banners and popups, as the publisher struggles to make its digital commercial model work. Unlike other newspaper publishers that have diversified by building subscription and reader revenue offerings, Reach has stuck solely to digital advertising, in part hampered by owning titles that arguably would not support such initiatives. Despite digitally being Britain’s biggest newspaper group, and sixth biggest online operation in the UK after Google owner Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and the BBC, the company has said its digital revenues fell £21m last year to £127.8m. The company blames the big tech firms for deprioritising news in users’ feeds. However, the misfiring digital strategy is in large part responsible for a precipitous slump in Reach’s market value from £1.3bn in mid-2021 to just £220m. After the latest round of job cuts, overall employee numbers will fall to about 3,500 – 36% fewer than in 2016 – with its regional newspaper publishing operation stretched to breaking point. “I think many shareholders are pinning their hopes on a sale,” said a fourth source. “MPs and political parties are going to have to think about how they get their message out. If they want to save local journalism, they need to act now and think about an alternative to Reach’s ownership of their local media.” Reach, which has said it needs to cut operating costs by up to a further 6% this year, said it still made a £95m profit in 2023. Alex DeGroote, a media and tech analyst, said: “Revenues are not showing much sign of a pickup, so the inference would be that cost-cutting is ongoing. You can tell how serious it is when you are having to let the editor of your flagship title go, it’s symbolic. “It looks to be shareholders first and foremost, editorial output second and readers are probably below that. Sooner or later Reach is going to run out of road in terms of cost savings and will have to look to put its assets together with another player.”"

        "content": "More men than women were appointed to the boards of large financial services firms in Europe last year, even as nearly a third of companies risked falling short of the EU’s upcoming plans to impose mandatory quotas for women on corporate boards. A survey from the consultancy firm EY published on Monday reveals that 44% of non-executive appointments in 2023 were women, down from 51% a year earlier. The European Financial Services Boardroom Monitor also shows that nearly a third of listed financial services firms – 31% –continue to fall short of the EU’s looming targets for gender diversity. By June 2026, the EU will begin implementing a legally binding 40% quota for women on corporate boards, in what European lawmakers described as a landmark deal for gender equality. Omar Ali, the managing partner for EMEIA financial services at EY, warned firms against undoing the “excellent progress” of the past few years. “It has been evidenced time and again that boardroom diversity is a driver of outperformance,” he said in a statement. The survey suggests that C-suite experience – referring to experience in roles such as chief executive officer or chief financial officer – was the top criteria for recruiters in 2023. EY’s data, which includes countries in the EU as well as the UK, Norway and Switzerland, suggests female directors remain significantly less likely than their male counterparts to have this experience or have held a senior board position. Ali described the demand for C-suite experience as “understandable and to be expected” but this “should not, however, come at the cost of better balancing gender representation across Europe’s financial boardrooms”, he noted. “Recruitment of new board directors should encourage new skills and expertise entering the boardroom,” Ali added. “The 40% level of female representation at board level is a minimum to build from, not a level to work towards.” In 2022, women occupied 32.2% of boardroom positions across the EU, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality. The figure varied widely across member states. Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark met the threshold in 2022, while France, home to a 40% women-on-boards quota, surpassed it. In Hungary, Estonia and Cyprus, in contrast, women accounted for only one in 10 board members."

        "content": "Boeing is implementing a further set of checks on its 737 Max 9 production lines and opening factories to airline scrutiny as it attempts to demonstrate the safety of its troubled plane. The US manufacturer said it would also bring in independent assessors, beyond normal regulation, and send a team to the plant of its main supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, to check its processes as well. Spirit manufactured the plug door that blew out of a new Boeing 737 Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight this month, forcing an emergency landing with a gaping hole in the plane’s fuselage. The US Federal Aviation Administration has since grounded that particular 737 Max variant pending inspections, and announced a full audit and investigation of Boeing’s production processes. Boeing executives have said they take responsibility and would address the problem with full transparency, after having been previously condemned for initially dismissing separate concerns about the 737 Max 8 following a fatal crash in 2018.   Related: ‘Loose bolts in a young aircraft’: what went wrong at Boeing – and can it be fixed?   Stan Deal, the president of company’s commercial aeroplanes division, said in a letter to employees on Monday that it was deploying staff to Spirit’s plant in Wichita, Kansas, to check and approve work, specifically including work on the plug doors, before fuselages were shipped to Boeing’s plant in Washington state. Both Boeing and Spirit’s 737 production facilities will be opened for airlines to carry out inspections. Deal said Boeing would also hold sessions for employees on quality management, as well as bringing in a third party to conduct an independent assessment of its processes. He wrote: “Everything we do must conform to the requirements in our QMS [quality management system]. Anything less is unacceptable. It is through this standard that we must operate to provide our customers and their passengers complete confidence in Boeing airplanes.” Accident investigators from the US are yet to report on the exact reasons for the incident on 5 January, which ended without casualties but could have proved disastrous. While Boeing seeks to limit reputational damage, US authorities have stepped up oversight of the aerospace manufacturer, with the FAA announcing on Friday it would significantly increase checks and reporting its belief that there were “other manufacturing problems” at the company. Loose bolts have been found by airlines in subsequent checks of 737 Max 9s and other defects were reported in the week before the Alaska Airlines incident. Software in the 737 Max 8 caused two of the deadliest plane crashes in recent history when the model was first launched, killing 346 people in 2018 and 2019."

        "content": "  3.06pm GMT   Train drivers have called a further week of rolling strikes across England from late January in their long-running dispute with operators over pay. Members of the Aslef union will strike for 24 hours at each train-operating company on the national railway on different days between Tuesday 30 January and Monday 5 February. The Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, said:   We have given the government every opportunity to come to the table but it has now been a year since we had any contact from the Department for Transport [DfT]. It’s clear they do not want to resolve this dispute. Many of our members have now not had a single penny increase to their pay in half a decade, during which inflation soared and with it the cost of living. Train drivers didn’t even ask for an increase during the Covid-19 pandemic when they worked throughout as key workers, risking their lives to allow NHS and other workers to travel.  A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said:   Nobody wins when strikes impact lives and livelihoods, and they’re particularly difficult to justify at a time when taxpayers are continuing to contribute an extra £54m a week to keep services running post-Covid. Despite the railway’s huge financial challenge, drivers have been made an offer which would take base salaries to nearly £65,000 for a four-day week without overtime – that is well above the national average and significantly more than many of our passengers that have no option to work from home are paid.    Related: Train drivers in England to hold fresh week of strikes from late January   Oil prices are falling on world markets today, after Brent crude leapt through $80 a barrel last Friday following US and UK air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea. Brent is 0.6% lower at $77.80 a barrel while US crude has lost 0.7% to $72.17 a barrel. A fresh attack on a ship passing through the Red Sea is being investigated by United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations. It posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it had received reports of an “incident” 95 nautical miles south-east of Aden, Yemen.

Stay tuned! – JK     2.29pm GMT  Asda cuts Aptamil prices by 7%  Asda has become the second supermarket to announce that it is reducing the cost of Aptamil baby formula after the French food giant Danone agreed to a 7% price cut to retailers. Asda also said it will let customers pay for baby formula using their rewards scheme vouchers for the first time, as of today. A total of six Aptamil products across the core range will be reduced in price by an average of 7% (the price cuts can be viewed here). Last week, Iceland said it would be cutting the cost of Aptamil from 16 January after Danone agreed to reduce the price for its Aptamil powdered formula to retailers by up to 7%. Kris Comerford, Asda’s chief commercial officer, said:   For many of Asda’s customers, and families nationwide, we understand that buying baby formula is a vital necessity in their weekly shop, which is why we’re taking swift action to pass on falling manufacturing costs to customers before any other retailer. At the same time, we’ve decided to remove exclusions on using Asda Rewards vouchers to pay for baby formula. Whilst we respect the regulations in place regarding the sale of baby formula, we want to do everything we can to help families manage their budget and keep their family fed.      2.03pm GMT   Disruption to Red Sea traffic has worsened, as Qatar, the biggest single user of the route in 2023, paused a number of vessels due to cross through the Bab al-Mandab strait over the weekend. Alex Froley, LNG market analyst at ICIS, said:  The narrow passage, at the bottom of the Red Sea, has become the centre of global attention over recent weeks after Houthi attacks on shipping crossing the strait, followed by US and UK counter-strikes at the end of last week. Three laden Qatari tankers that were signalling a course to the Suez Canal cut their speed on Sunday 14 January and started circling off the coast of Oman, east of the strait. The Al Ghariya, Al Huwaila and Al Nuaman seemed to be waiting to decide whether to head west through the strait into the Red Sea, or instead to divert south to head around Southern Africa to Europe. The tankers were all likely heading to Europe, possibly to a long-term contract customer of Qatar such as Italy or Poland, or to make a spot delivery to Qatar’s UK terminal position. Heading down around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and then back north to Europe would take around 27 days to reach the UK, compared with only 18 via the Red Sea and Suez Canal route. Qatari ships have been seen taking this longer route before, but very rarely.      12.38pm GMT  Eurozone trade surplus surges in November  The eurozone’s trade in goods surplus surged in November, as imports declined more than exports. The eurozone recorded a €20.3bn surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world in November, compared with a surplus of €11.1bn in October, and a deficit of €13.8bn in November 2022. Exports fell by 4.7% year-on-year while imports dropped 16.7%, according to Eurostat, the European Commissions’s statistics office. Intra-euro area trade fell to €227.2bn in November, down by 9.4% from a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted trade balance also shows an improving surplus of €14.8bn, where exports were up 0.9% on the month while imports fell by 0.6% on the month. The eurozone exported 2% more to the UK between January and November compared with a year earlier, and imported less from the UK, down 16.8%. As a result, the currency bloc’s trade surplus with the UK rose to €143.5bn from €103.4bn.     12.18pm GMT   An unprecedented medicines shortage in the NHS is endangering lives, pharmacists have said, as unpublished figures reveal that the number of products in short supply has doubled in two years. A treatment for controlling epileptic seizures was the latest to be added on Wednesday to a UK drugs shortage list that includes treatments for conditions ranging from cancer to schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes. Causes of the crisis are thought to include the plummeting purchasing value of the pound since the Brexit referendum, which reduces the NHS’s ability to source medicines abroad, and a government policy of taxing manufacturers. According to Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) figures provided to the British Generic Manufacturers Association, there were 111 drugs on a shortages list on 30 October last year and 96 on 18 December, with supply notifications issued for a further 10 treatments to NHS providers in the UK since then.

Updated at 12.40pm GMT    12.17pm GMT   South West Water has been accused of not being honest with the government about its drought preparations after parts of the country almost ran out of water in 2022, it has emerged. The Environment Agency told the water industry regulator, Ofwat, that SWW was “not honest” with regulators about the risk a drought posed to the company’s water supplies, and was inadequately prepared for the heatwave. People in Devon and Cornwall were affected by months of hosepipe bans as reservoirs ran dangerously low during the dry spell two years ago. Three of SWW’s reservoirs fell to record lows during the drought. The agency said the company showed “complacency” prior to the drought and “a lack of understanding of their own supply system”.

The German national statistics office said “multiple crises” affecting the economy had contributed to a 0.3% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 from the previous year as higher interest rates and elevated living costs took their toll. “Despite recent price declines, prices remained high at all stages in the economic process and put a damper on economic growth,” said Ruth Brand, the president of the statistics office, at a press conference in Berlin on Monday.   Related: Germany on track for two-year recession as economy shrinks in 2023       11.34am GMT  Train drivers call further strikes in England  Train drivers have called a further week of rolling strikes in England from late January, in the long-running dispute over pay, reports our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. Members of the Aslef union will strike for 24 hours at each train operating company on the national railway on different days between Tuesday 30 January and Monday 5 February. Drivers will also refuse to work overtime throughout the strike period, causing prolonged disruption in parts of the railway that rely on rest day working. The latest strikes follow a similar week of rolling action in December, after 14 previous days of nationwide stoppages over the 18-month dispute. Walkouts are likely to stop all trains at affected operators, although there is now the possibility that firms could demand 40% of their timetable runs under the government’s new minimum services levels law. However, the legislation is untested and rail firms as well as unions have expressed concern about the practicalities and consequences. The rail strikes will only take place at firms contracted to the Department for Transport in England, but some cross-border services they operate into Scotland and Wales may be affected.  Updated at 11.39am GMT    11.10am GMT   Oil prices continue to fall on world markets, after Brent crude jumped through $80 a barrel last Friday following air strikes by the US and UK governments against Yemen’s Houthi militia, whose attacks on shipping in the Red Sea pose a threat to world trade.  Brent is down 0.8% at $77.69 a barrel this morning while US crude, which went through $75 last week, is trading 0.9% lower at $72.03 a barrel. Britain’s “decisive” action in the Red Sea “dealt a blow” to the Houthis, the UK’s defence secretary has said. In his first major speech, Grant Shapps said “enough was enough” and precision strikes were authorised in response to Houthi attacks because they “chose to ignore” clear warnings. More on our Middle East live blog:   Related: Middle East crisis live: US-UK strikes ‘dealt a blow’ to Houthis, says British defence secretary       9.54am GMT   European shares have turned negative.  The FTSE 100 index in London is trading 0.1% lower at 7,615 while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC have also slipped 0.1% and the Italian market is trading 0.3% lower. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:  An escalation of tensions in the Red Sea amid US and UK strikes on Houthi rebels raises the prospect of renewed inflationary pressures as the resulting disruption to global shipping pushes up freight costs. Oil prices continued to bubble but are below the $80 per barrel levels reached last week. There was some positive news on inflation on Friday thanks to an unexpected contraction in producer price inflation in the US – so called factory gate prices are often a leading indicator for consumer prices so this offers some encouragement. There was mixed performance and messaging from US banks as the latest earnings season across the Atlantic got underway – with some signs of stress in consumer debt. The jobs market is often a good barometer of economic conditions as firms hire when they’re feeling confident and retrench when times are tough – so PageGroup becoming the latest recruiter to warn on profit is a slight worry. This is a mild warning, suggesting the end of last year saw the outlook suffer significant deterioration. Profit is only expected to be slightly below previous guidance but the signs certainly weren’t encouraging in the final quarter of 2023. The company’s decision to let go a good chunk of its own workforce tells its own story. A modest move higher in PageGroup’s fees for temporary placements, alongside a big drop in fees for permanent positions, suggests companies are looking to retain some flexibility with staffing needs.      9.48am GMT   Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz, said:  German #GDP fell by -0.3% q/q in Q4 2023, but the previous quarter was revised up to 0.0%. Thanks to the upward revision of Q3, #Germany has managed to avoid a recession in the second half of 2023. Annual GDP growth printed at -0.3% in 2023 vs. 2022 (as expected in our latest…— Ludovic Subran (@Ludovic_Subran) January 15, 2024   Updated at 9.50am GMT    9.22am GMT   Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said:  Now it’s official. The German economy shrank by 0.3% year-on-year in 2023. What’s worse, however, is that there is no imminent rebound in sight and the economy looks set to go through the first two-year recession since the early 2000s. The year 2023 was another turbulent one, with the economy in permanent crisis mode. In fact, since 2020, there has been a long list of crises and challenges facing the German economy: supply chain frictions resulting from the pandemic lockdowns and war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, surging inflation, tightening of monetary policy, China’s changing role from being a flourishing export destination to being a rival that needs fewer German products, and several structural shortcomings… All in all, we expect the current state of stagnation and shallow recession to continue. In fact, the risk that 2024 will be another year of recession is high. We expect the German economy to shrink by 0.3% year-on-year this year. It would be the first time since the early 2000s that Germany has gone through a two-year recession, even though it could prove to be a shallow one.   Updated at 9.47am GMT    9.20am GMT   Here’s some instant reaction. Oliver Rakau, chief Germany economist at Oxford Economics, tweeted:  The German economy contracted by 0.3% q/q in Q4 based on what @destatis said at its press conference on the annual GDP release and relying on limited data. A touch better then the -0.4% I budgeted, but given the very weak monthly data wouldn't be surprised by small revision. 1/3— Oliver Rakau (@OliverRakau) January 15, 2024  Claus Vistesen, eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, tweeted:  German GDP estimated down 0.1% in 2023, working day-adjusted. That looks like a small increase in Q4 GDP to me, likely due to net trade, but let's see. The December data could still swing the estimate to zero or even a slight fall.— Claus Vistesen (@ClausVistesen) January 15, 2024      9.05am GMT  German economy shrinks 0.3% in 2023  Germany’s economy, the largest in Europe, shrank 0.3% last year, in line with economists’ expectations. According to a preliminary estimate from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), the price adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) was 0.3% lower in 2023 than in the previous year. After adjustment for calendar effects, the decline in economic performance amounted to 0.1%. In 2022, the German economy had grown by 1.8%. Ruth Brand, the statistics office’s president, said:  Overall economic development faltered in Germany in 2023 in an environment that continues to be marked by multiple crises. Despite recent price declines, prices remained high at all stages in the economic process and put a damper on economic growth. Unfavourable financing conditions due to rising interest rates and weaker domestic and foreign demand also took their toll. Therefore, the German economy did not continue its recovery from the sharp economic slump experienced in the pandemic year of 2020.  GDP was 0.7% higher in 2023 than in 2019, the year before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Germany also contracted by 0.3% in the final quarter of last year following stagnation in the third quarter, thereby avoiding recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction). You can read the full report here.  Updated at 12.19pm GMT    8.40am GMT  Oil prices slip; UK to 'wait and see' on strikes against Houthis  Oil prices have just turned negative. Brent crude is slipped 0.15% to $78.17 a barrel while US crude is down 0.2% at $72.52 a barrel. The UK’s defence secretary said Britain would “wait and see” before launching further strikes against Houthi militia in Yemen. Grant Shapps told Sky News:  Let’s wait and see what happens, because it’s not that we want to be involved in the Red Sea. But ultimately freedom of navigation is an international right that must be protected.  But he said that Britain was keeping a close eye on the situation.  They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.   Updated at 8.47am GMT    8.32am GMT  Crest Nicholson warns on profits again  Crest Nicholson, the UK housebuilder has warned on profits for the third time in six months. This sparked speculation that the company could become a takeover target if its shares continue to fall. In an unscheduled trading update, the builder warned that full-year adjusted profit before tax would come in at £41m after it identified additional costs. This is far below the previous year’s profit of £137.8m. Its share price dropped 3.7%. Crest said:  The recent reduction in mortgage rates has provided a more constructive backdrop for house buyers and the wider housing market. Although it is too early to gauge customer behaviour, we have been encouraged by an increase in customer interest levels and inquiries this calendar year.  Anthony Codling, head of European housing and building materials at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, said:  It has been a tough year for Crest and unfortunately for the group and its investors the bad news continues. In our view if today’s trading update leads to further share price weakness, it could increase the chances of Crest being viewed as an attractive acquisition for another housebuilder.  Crest is due to release its full-year results next week, on 23 January.     8.21am GMT   Hunter has also looked at the US:  Markets continued their hesitant start to the year as mixed corporate earnings offset a positive slant arising from the latest inflation reading.  The fourth quarter earnings season comes with high expectations, especially given the current impasse between investors and the Federal Reserve on the timing of any interest rate cuts. By the same token, any slight misses look likely to be dealt with harshly, as evidenced by the market reaction to the first batch of earnings at the end of the week. The banks were caught in these uncertain crosshairs as their updates met with mixed reactions. Bank of America shares fell over 1% following a decline in quarterly profit, while Wells Fargo dipped by more than 3% despite posting higher profit for the period. JP Morgan Chase revealed a drop of 15% but in earnings but shares were relatively unaffected, while Citigroup edged higher after revealing a 10% cut to its workforce and a quarterly loss. Outlook comments maintained that the consumer remains resilient, although there was a concerning trend in increased loan defaults.  More positively, the inflation outlook received a boost as the latest producer price index reading showed an unexpected fall in prices in December.      8.07am GMT   European stock markets have opened cautiously higher. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has edged up 9 points to 7,634, a 0.1% gain. Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC are also up 0.1%, while Spain’s Ibex has gained 0.2%, Portugal’s PSI 20 rose 0.5% and the Italian borsa is flat to slightly lower. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said:  UK markets stayed undecided in opening trade in the absence of any major news and with the likelihood of a lighter trading day given the closure of Wall Street later. A broker upgrade lifted Sainsbury shares after last week’s partially disappointing update, while the banks showed some signs of life despite the lack of a concrete read across from those which reported in the States on Friday. The fourth quarter reporting season is yet to get into full swing in the UK as yet and in terms of economic releases there are readings on the unemployment and inflation rates to come this week, as well as a retail sales reading which should provide further colour on trading over the festive period. In the meantime, the main indices have been unable to build any momentum so far this year, with the FTSE 100 down by 1.3% and the FTSE 250 already languishing by 2.3%.   Updated at 8.21am GMT    8.04am GMT  Oil prices nudge higher as traders eye Middle East  Oil prices are heading higher again as traders watch for any supply disruption in the Middle East following US and UK air strikes to stop Houthi militia in Yemen attacking ships in the Red Sea. Brent crude remains below $80 a barrel, though, after surging through that level on Friday. The global benchmark has advanced 21 cents to $78.50 a barrel, up 0.3%, while US crude is 14 cents ahead at $72.82 a barrel. Both jumped more than 2% last week. Warren Patterson, head of commodities research at ING, told Reuters:  There are supply risks for the market given in the escalation in the Red Sea. However, for now we are not seeing any impact on oil supply. And I guess we would need to see significant escalation before that happens.  Yesterday, Houthi militia threatened a “strong and effective response” after the US carried another strike overnight.    Related: Houthi missile targeting US warship intercepted, says US, amid Red Sea tensions        7.54am GMT   Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, has looked at Taiwan’s election and what it means for the country’s fraught relations with China.  Geopolitically, tension rises following more US airstrikes on Yemen over the weekend, and domestically, President Biden faces challenges in foreign policy on two fronts: the Middle East and Taiwan. Both of these issues could weigh negatively on Consumer Sentiment. Xi Jinping might be grimacing after Taiwan elected Lai Ching-te for president, marking a third term for the Democratic Progressive Party. Voter turnout was 70%. Lai, who served as vice president since 2020, succeeds Tsai Ing-wen, who stepped aside due to term limits. Lai’s victory is seen as a rebuke to Beijing, as he has been labelled a “troublemaker” by pro-China factions and a supporter of Taiwan’s independence from The Chinese Communist Party. Lai emphasises the preservation of democracy and is expected to follow Tsai’s approach in deepening Taiwan’s ties with Washington without actively seeking confrontation with Beijing. China may view the election results as a step toward conflict, as Xi Jinping maintains that reunification with Taiwan is a historical inevitability.   Updated at 8.09am GMT    7.43am GMT  Introduction: UK house prices forecast to rise 3% in 2024; oil prices fall back below $80  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Business and political leaders as well as key players from charities, academia and other organisations are heading to the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, which will be held under the shadow of global crises. Over here, UK house prices are forecast to rise 3% this year, beating estimates of a decline, a leading estate agent has said, amid a mortgage pricing war and expectations of Bank of England interest rate cuts.   Related: UK house prices on track to rise 3% in 2024, says leading agent   The surge in oil prices on Friday following US and UK airstrikes against Houthi rebel sites in Yemen was short lived. Houthi rebel attacks on ships in the Red Sea have fuelled fears over disruption to trade. Brent crude, which rose above $80 last week, is back at $78.32 a barrel this morning while US crude is at $72.63 a barrel. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said:  Friday’s producer price inflation came as a certain relief to inflation worries as the latest data showed an unexpected contraction in the monthly figure. The jump in oil prices, following the US and UK airstrikes in areas in Yemen controlled by the Houthis, which sent the barrel of American crude to past the $75 per barrel level, didn’t last long. The risks are tilted to the upside as conflict news continues to flow in this Monday. Rishi Sunak will address parliament as his government is ready to intensify strikes on Houthi targets. Yet there is a strong barricade into the $74/75 per barrel level in the US crude and near $80 per barrel level in Brent, as the rising global supply, increasing competition to OPEC and the globally weak economic outlook weigh heavier and convince the bears to sell every geopolitically supported rallies.  China’s central bank left interest rates unchanged today despite expectations of a cut, while pumping more cash into the financial system. The operation resulted in a net 216bn yuan fresh fund injection into the banking system. The reaction on the Chinese stock market was muted, with the Chinese CSI 300 index edging 0.15% higher. A weakening Chinese currency has limited the room for the People’s Bank of China to reduce borrowing costs and rate cuts could be postponed until later this year. The yuan has weakened more than 1% against the dollar so far this year. Economists at Capital Economics said:  We suspect the main reason the PBOC failed to deliver this time is a desire to avoid triggering renewed depreciation pressure on the renminbi.  Economists at ANZ said the central bank might have held off cutting rates as “authorities may be concerned about bank profitability”. Wall Street is closed for Martin Luther King Day today. The US stock markets ended last week flattish (the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose slightly, while the Dow Jones slipped 0.3%).

        "content": "South West Water has been accused of not being honest with the government about its drought preparations after parts of the country almost ran out of water in 2022, it has emerged. The Environment Agency (EA) told the water industry regulator Ofwat that SWW was “not honest” with regulators about the risk a drought posed to the company’s water supplies and was inadequately prepared for the heatwave. People in Devon and Cornwall were affected by months of hosepipe bans as reservoirs ran dangerously low during the dry spell in 2022. Three of SWW’s reservoirs fell to record lows during the drought.   Related: UK butterfly count could show fall in numbers after 2022 drought   The agency said the company showed complacency before the drought and “a lack of understanding of their own supply system”.  Documents obtained by Greenpeace’s investigations website Unearthed under freedom of information laws revealed the environmental watchdog’s scathing assessment of the water company’s drought preparedness. “SWW were not honest, open and transparent with regulators about their drought projections and potential risks to security of supply,” the EA wrote in a July email to Ofwat. The email said “SWW acted too late” in response to the drought, and that this “presented a genuine risk of loss of supply in west Cornwall”. The EA said the company had a misunderstanding of its own supplies and thought it had so much water that it could pipe it to other regions. The agency told Ofwat SWW that showed “a lack of understanding of their own supply system, considering themselves as a potential water donor in the future, only to find the reverse is true”. The company’s latest plan states that it needs to close a gap of more than 200m litres of water a day by 2050 to meet demand. Water was so scarce in 2022 that drastic saving measures banning all non-critical use were almost put in place. This would have meant a ban on ponds and swimming pools being refilled, people washing their cars and non-residential buildings being cleaned. No new reservoirs have been built in the UK since the water industry was privatised in 1989, and some water companies have added to their profits by selling off existing facilities. Water companies have paid out £72bn in dividends since privatisation, borrowing £56bn and increasing bills by 40%. The EA told Ofwat that new water sources need to “be considered, applied for and permitted during the drought instead of planned in advance”. Megan Corton Scott, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “South West Water have failed in tackling the sewage crisis, failed to prepare for drought, failed to even understand their own supply system and failed to be honest with the regulator, but they did succeed in raising shareholder dividends at the end of last year. “Rishi Sunak promised tough enforcement and a more resilient water infrastructure. Given this platform of incompetence and blatant money grabbing, how long can the government stand idly by and let this company continue to control such a critical part of the nation’s resources?” A spokesperson for SWW said: “We strongly reject any suggestion that we were not adequately prepared for the risk of drought or that we did not operate in good faith with the regulators. “Despite facing a once-in-a-generation drought in the south-west, no customer went without water supply and we successfully maintained a robust supply of water to over 3.5 million customers and 10million visitors to the region.” The company was fined over illegal dumping of sewage last year after investigations by the EA. Last week, the owner of SWW, Pennon Group, bought Sutton and East Surrey Water in a deal worth £380m."

        "content": "One of Britain’s largest housebuilders, Crest Nicholson, has issued its third profit warning in a matter of months because of rising costs, raising speculation that it could become a takeover target unless its fortunes reverse. The Surrey-based company will issue its full-year results in less than a week. They are expected to lay bare the challenging year that housebuilders such as Crest Nicholson have faced amid surging interest rates, which have deterred buyers and caused house prices to fall. Crest Nicholson said its latest profit warning was the result of a “comprehensive review” of rising costs including bills linked to a Surrey-based development site that contributed to its second profit downgrade in November.   Related: UK house prices on track to rise 3% in 2024, says leading agent   It told investors on Monday that the climbing costs linked to the Brightwells Yard regeneration scheme in Farnham, as well as other projects, would shave up to 18% off its adjusted profits, which are estimated to come in at £41m for 2023. The company said it would earmark £13m for potential legal costs linked to a fire at one of its low-rise apartment schemes in 2021. Shares were down 4.7% on Monday morning, making Crest Nicholson one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250. Crest Nicholson first downgraded its profits in August, when it said it was likely to make £50m in profit for the financial year, compared with about £74m it had expected back in June. The downgrade followed a drop in sales, particularly from first-time buyers. On top of the deterring effect of higher interest rates, which make mortgages more expensive, sales fell because of the end of the government’s help-to-buy scheme, which allowed people to buy a home with a 5% deposit. In November, Crest Nicholson again warned investors after costs linked to Brightwells Yard development rose by £11m, forcing the company to reveal that full-year profits would more likely be in the range of £45m to £50m. The third and most recent profits warning has led analysts to speculate over whether Crest Nicholson could become a takeover target. Anthony Codling, the head of European housing and building materials research for the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, said: “It has been a tough year for Crest and, unfortunately for the group and its investors, the bad news continues. In our view if today’s trading update leads to further share price weakness it increases the chances that Crest may be viewed as an attractive acquisition for another housebuilder.” Crest Nichsolson said a recent reduction in mortgage rates, which has helped lure more buyers on to the market, had “provided a more constructive backdrop for house buyers and the wider housing market”. “Although it is too early to gauge customer behaviour, we have been encouraged by an increase in customer interest levels and inquiries this calendar year,” the company added. Meanwhile, the global property consultancy Knight Frank said a mortgage pricing war and expectations of Bank of England interest rate cuts could rekindle the property market. The estate agent said on Monday it had updated its forecast for UK house prices to rise by 3% in 2024, up from an earlier estimate of a 4% decline."

        "content": "More people in the UK are struggling to access vital medicines than ever before, exacerbating conditions from epilepsy to the menopause. Here, four people share how the shortages have affected their health and wellbeing. Phil Betts, 44, an insurance firm employee from Norwich, has experienced shortages of epilepsy medicationI have a nocturnal, sleep-related form of epilepsy, which is caused by tiredness. I have night fits or seizures within an hour of waking up. It usually takes about half an hour to come round after, and it makes me feel tired for the whole day. It’s pretty well controlled, sometimes I can go three to four months without anything, but I’ve found if I do have a fit I’m likely to get another one quite quickly after, so you’re almost building up immunity. That’s why consistent medication is really important to keep it stable. I take 13 pills three times a day. Clobazam – that’s where I’ve had the problem with shortages, because my usual brand is Frisium. In November, and also for my most recent delivery, a different brand was sent. Back in November, I had two seizures in two nights – last week I had the same problem. I contacted my hospital consultant who said it’s not a great idea to be swapping around different manufacturers, it’s how they put the pills together, it’s not always the same. That could have an effect on how it’s released into your body. For another medication, Epilim (sodium valproate), there’s been a delay quite a few times, it’s been out of stock with online Pharmacy2U. I phoned Boots originally and they had none, so I tried two to three local ones and again no joy. Luckily, I managed to get some in the end, but I’ve still got some pills owed to me. Getting worried about whether the medication is going to turn up on time and tracking it, not only is that using up my time but it’s pretty stressful with a condition which can cause a lot of trouble. The stress itself can trigger a fit. When you go to sleep you think, “Oh no, what’s going to happen tonight?” It’s not the first time I’ve encountered shortages, but it’s probably the worst. Since about November I’ve had to keep chasing where the medication is at. I can’t think of a previous occasion where I’ve totally run out. I’m not particularly looking forward to the next time when I need to get some more in. If it means I have to travel around different pharmacies I’ll have to do it. That’s the other problem – I don’t drive because of my epilepsy so I’m having to ask people to give me lifts around. Grace Young, 19, from Devizes, in Wiltshire has to travel more than three hours to get her ADHD medicationThe medication shortage has turned my life upside down. With my medication – Elvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) – I’m amazing. I can get everything done and more. I’m great at work, I can reliably make myself meals and look after myself and my wellbeing. My medication allows me to think straight. I can focus on one thing at a time instead of 10 at once and getting nothing done. Without my medication, I have all of this taken off me. It’s made me realise that being able to function normally with medication is a luxury, and it shouldn’t be like that. I rely on my medication so much, I’ve been on various medications since my diagnosis at 14. Without it I feel 14 again. I’ve got no sense of self-management. Medication has been next to none. Because I’m not with the adult ADHD service my GP can’t prescribe me anything else at all. I’ve tried a variety of vitamins but nothing comes close to the mental clarity and change of mindset ADHD medication can give you. The closest places that stock my medication are more than three hours away. I’ve tried getting it delivered but it’s out of stock when I try. No luck at all. It’s been the same for months. Naomi Cooper, 43, an HIV and sexual health worker from Gloucestershire, is experiencing unpleasant side-effects from alternatives to her usual form of HRTOver the past four years, there have been very few times where my HRT prescription has actually been in stock – at the moment it’s been out of stock for about five months. I’m prescribed an oestrogen patch and my progesterone is prescribed separately. That was also out of stock for a number of months last year. If your progesterone is out of stock, you can’t take the oestrogen because that’s what protects your womb. If your oestrogen is out of stock that’s when you’ll get the side-effects of menopause – hot flushes, not being able to sleep, your bones literally ache. If I don’t have the right oestrogen I feel 20 years older, your brain doesn’t function correctly, your thought processes aren’t particularly smooth, you forget words, appointments, sometimes your own name. I was offered a spray, but that caused migraines, which were debilitating. I was offered a different brand of patch and my skin reacted so it caused burning and red welts on my skin. The patch I use trickles in and out of stock at the moment – I got stock about two months ago after waiting for 2.5 months, but I’m coming to the end so I’ll be back to square one. I have to start again with what products do I replace and what side-effects do I put up with. Going through menopause younger the risk of heart disease is higher, and of low bone density and damage to the brain. It’s the worst I’ve known it; they release dates where they say stock will be sent out but those dates come and go and there’s no stock available. There’s now women on pharmacy waiting lists, so even if the stock comes in that will immediately go out. It’s really frustrating, you spend quite a lot of time online checking the pharmacies’ stock, nipping in to see if you’ve timed it right with a delivery. Rose Langlands, 29, from Maidstone, Kent, is finding that shortages of antipsychotics are increasing her anxietyI have borderline personality disorder and bipolar, which means that I can go from being extremely manic to suicidal, there’s no in between. Medication helps keep me level. I had problems accessing quetiapine, an antipsychotic, and duloxetine, an antidepressant. It happened about a year or two ago, but it was bad to the point where I’ve changed pharmacy about three times. They had to change my brand of duloxetine because my original dose wasn’t available, so they have had to split it in two. I’m not on quetiapine any more because of the shortages – I was switched to aripiprazole after six months. Luckily, that works well for me and I haven’t had any problems with it, but I’m always anxious going into the pharmacy and them saying: “Sorry we haven’t got any of your drugs in stock.” There were definitely a lot of consequences for me not having my medication for a few months. A lot of people were concerned about my manic episodes because I can be very much out of control, spending a ridiculous amount, getting myself further into debt, not being able to function properly. The same with my anxiety, I stayed indoors, didn’t want to go out. I’ve been taking medication for about nine years now and I never had to worry about it, all of a sudden there were shortages. When you have the mental health team saying you need to be taking your medication regularly, and then you have the shortages it’s a bit like, what can I do? "

        "content": "Alison Phillips will be leaving her role as editor of the Daily Mirror at the end of the month amid massive job and budget cuts throughout the tabloid’s parent company, the Guardian understands. Phillips, 53, has accepted voluntary redundancy as Reach – owner of the Mirror, Express and scores of local newspapers – pushes through the biggest annual loss of jobs in the UK newspaper industry for decades. A source at the Mirror said Phillips was “universally loved and respected by staff for her leadership and kindness”. They added: “She has ensured the Mirror remains the powerful voice it is for the decent, compassionate people of Britain because she herself is decent and compassionate. “While there are some great journalists left at the Mirror, many fear that without Alison at the helm, it’s the end for the UK’s only left-leaning tabloid. Everyone is gutted for Alison, who has worked very hard for the brand and her staff amid some terrible calls from above.” Phillips has led the Mirror since 2018, when she took over the post from Peter Willis to become the paper’s first female editor since 1903. She was formerly editor of short-lived newspaper the New Day, another venture of Reach, which was then called Trinity Mirror. She was named columnist of the year by the National Press Awards in 2018 for her Wednesday column in the Mirror. Phillips did not immediately return requests for comment. Roy Greenslade, the ex-Daily Mirror editor and former Guardian columnist, posted on X that Phillips was a “fine editor” and said the development was “such bad news for the Daily Mirror.” He added that Reach was “facing an existential crisis”. The departure of Phillips, first reported by the Daily Drone, came just months after Reach announced plans to cut about 450 jobs – almost a tenth of its entire workforce – in an effort to trim operating costs by 5% to 6% in 2024. Over the past year, Reach has culled almost 800 roles in total – the biggest annual loss of jobs in the UK newspaper industry for decades. The company had already cut costs by 6% over the past year, with a reduction of 200 roles in a £30m cost-cutting drive after a slump in the digital and print newspaper advertising market. The value of Reach has slumped 30% over the last year as large social media platforms, most notably Facebook, deprioritised news, hurting the company’s digital revenue strategy. The company reported in its third quarter trading update a 13.7% drop in digital revenue, with online page views slumping by 21% year-on-year in the first nine months. Meanwhile, with income from newspaper sales and advertising also continuing to decline, total print revenues fell by 6%. Jim Mullen, the chief executive of the company, has not ruled out further cuts, telling staff in November that the company must “set ourselves up to win” in an “increasingly fast-paced, competitive and customer-focused digital world.” “Our industry has a history of change and the future will undoubtedly involve yet more,” added Mullen. In July 2020, Reach cut 550 staff, about 12% of its workforce at the time, in response to the Covid pandemic. As the UK’s largest commercial news publisher, Reach’s titles include the Daily Star, the Daily Record, the Manchester Evening News, the Liverpool Echo and the Live network of local news websites."

        "content": "Escalating tensions in the Middle East, rising oil prices and lengthy delays to international shipping have been hogging the headlines in the past few days. Before this, the prospects for the world economy had been looking a little brighter. But with military intervention in the Red Sea and disruption to global trade, all bets are off. As world leaders gather this week for the annual Davos meeting in Switzerland, the concern will be that last year’s downward march for inflation will be halted by rising geopolitical tensions. Since the last mountaintop bash, conflict has spread from eastern Europe to the Middle East, while the risk of a new cold war is mounting – not least highlighted by China’s frosty response to the election of Taiwan’s new pro-sovereignty president last week. With the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Middle East, global oil prices and freight costs have surged, while Britain and the US launching airstrikes against Houthi rebels last week raised the stakes after the Yemeni group’s attacks on Red Sea shipping. It isn’t any wonder the US-led military operation has been given a rather Ronseal working title: Operation Prosperity Guardian. The shipping lane serves as a vital artery for the economies of Europe and North America through the Suez canal, which handles 12% of global trade and 30% of container traffic. Most shipments are from Asia to the ports of northern Europe; with about 50 a day normally traversing the 120-mile canal, carrying $5bn of goods each week. With major shipping lines diverting traffic around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa to avoid Houthi attacks, about 3,000-3,500 nautical miles (6,000km) are being added to journeys connecting Europe with Asia. Forcing ships to travel for about 10 days longer on average comes with a cost: after 90% of shipments were diverted in the first week of January, container rates on the main Shanghai-Rotterdam route have jumped from $1,170 (£917) in early December to $4,400 on 11 January, according to the Dutch bank ING. All this is reminiscent of the blocking of the Suez canal by the Ever Given container ship two years ago, which caused mass problems for world trade and contributed to the worst inflationary burst for four decades. This time around, there are again warnings from European companies about empty shelves and higher prices, including from Ikea, Tesco and Aldi. Half of all toys imported and about two-fifths of homewares imported to the UK come from China, according to the consultancy Retail Economics. Tesla and Volvo have paused production because of component shortages at their European factories. Adding to the logistical meltdown, droughts have reduced crossings of the Panama canal between the Atlantic and Pacific. Economists, however, have so far been a little more sanguine than panicked media headlines might suggest. Unlike two years ago, the supply disruption takes place against a very different economic backdrop. Demand is faltering after higher living costs and elevated interest rates hit households. Global economic growth is forecast to slow sharply this year; capacity in world shipping has increased after the launch of several new, massive container vessels, while volumes of sea freight were already down before the disruption started. While container rates might have tripled, they remain far lower than two years ago. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, the most widely used index for sea freight rates for imports from China worldwide, is still down by more than half. Oil prices have risen sharply in recent days amid fears about the disruption to global trade through key shipping lanes, climbing to more than $80 a barrel. But they remain significantly below a peak of almost $140 in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, events could still change, especially if disruption is sustained or geopolitical tensions mount further. Ever since the Suez canal opened in 1869 it has been a linchpin for world trade and British interests in particular. Military intervention isn’t new: British warships have patrolled the 30km-wide Bab el-Mandeb strait for centuries, with the port of Aden forcibly seized in 1839 to establish an important coaling station on the passage to India. Once the second-busiest harbour in the world after New York, Aden’s significance has waned since Yemen’s independence in 1967, driven by decades of war and political crisis left in Britain’s wake, while advances in shipping have reduced the need for stopovers. Yet the choke point between the Horn of Africa and Arabian peninsula has remained strategically important for international trade since. As global energy prices increase once more, there should be particular alarm for Britain. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, efforts to diversify gas supplies have increased the UK’s reliance on fossil fuel imports from the Middle East, including Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas. European LNG imports rose by 71% in 2022 in the rush to replace Russian gas, including a 74% rise to the UK, which sources almost one-third of its imported supply from the country. Corporate executives and policymakers had been spending much of the past two years talking about decoupling and deglobalisation, amid a buzz around “reshoring” of supply chains from Asia closer to home. However, as the crisis in the Middle East shows, Britain is as addicted as ever to imports from Asia. Mainland China remains the top import source for about 70 economies around the world. While unpicking global supply lines built up over decades was hardly going to happen overnight, the west is still reliant on the country despite the political breakdown with Beijing. Official figures show 2023 was on track to be another near-record year for Chinese imports to Britain. Volumes have fallen from a record year in 2022, but still more than £50bn of goods arrived on British shores in the year to November, comfortably exceeding pre-Covid levels. After the succession of global shocks since the Covid pandemic, inflation had mellowed in 2023, raising hopes for interest rate cuts from the world’s most powerful central banks. It would have provided a helpful boost for living standards and economic growth in a key election year on both sides of the Atlantic. While the hope is that disruption will be minimised, that is far from guaranteed for Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak."

Please don’t ridicule me, it’ll be your turn one day. Technically, I’m not a boomer. I was born in 1965, one year past the official deadline. But if he talks like a boomer, texts like a boomer and puts Thousand Island dressing on his salad, he’s a boomer.   Related: The best time for a meeting is no meeting at all – unless you’re a Meeting Whisperer   It’s difficult to name a time in modern industrial society when four generations of workers share the same workplace: millennials, gen Z-ers, boomers and gen X-ers, all of whom have very different experiences and attitudes to life – and work. At work, I do the things that only boomers do, often infuriating those younger than me. I write notes in a notebook instead of a note-taking app and I keep a manual calendar. I make phone calls instead of sending emails. I leave my office and meet with clients and prospects face to face instead of online. I’m also a big proponent of working at least three days a week in an actual office and I don’t think that Mondays and Fridays should be automatic work-from-home days. I bristle when I hear about “quiet quitters” and “coffee badgers” – who pop into the office to make an appearance and then disappear – because I feel this type of behavior is baffling not only to a business owner like myself but to anyone who wants to get ahead in the world and make a good living. Like most boomers, I have a difficult time differentiating between legitimate mental health issues and making excuses. I have to do a better job at understanding different points of view. I have to realize that when I try to act younger, I’m just looking older and that younger people are ridiculing me for that too. And they are. Just go online and you’ll find countless comments like “old people love talking about when there were only three channels” and that boomers “love giving financial advice” and “think everyone else is overly sensitive”. Fair. My generation is constantly being ridiculed. Much of it’s deserved. But to my younger friends I have a word of warning: boomers are still very much running the world. The ad world and media in general love to think that small business is full of beautiful, diverse people in their 20s and 30s running sustainable, innovative, pioneering and admirable coffee shops, craft bourbon distilleries and vertical farms. But the reality – according to data from the US government – is that more than half (54%) of the businesses in this country are owned by people over the age of 50 – 4% are 70 or older. And the management of most major corporations is still mostly male and white. They’re boomers. And no one likes to admit that. This, of course, is changing and that is a great thing. There will be more diversity. We will see more Black and brown and female faces running businesses. Wealth will transfer. Someday in the not-too-distant future, the millennials and gen-Z generations will take their rightful place to represent the majority of corporate leaders and business owners. And then, rest assured, younger generations will ridicule them too."

        "content": "‘When people are so vulnerable, they often don’t even know that they’re being exploited. It’s really difficult to see who is on your side.” Leicester community activist Tarek Islam is describing the position of many workers in the city’s garment factories. Unpaid wages, unexplained dismissals, punishing working hours … he and his colleagues at community project Fab-L (Fashion-workers’ Advice Bureau Leicester) have uncovered a catalogue of exploitative practices. Fab-L is a collaboration with unions Unite and GMB, backed by clothing brands including Asos, Next, River Island and Boohoo – this last via a charitable trust. Its aim is to help garment workers understand and enforce their employment rights. The findings of Islam and his colleagues chime with those of a 2022 study in which more than half of the garment workers surveyed said they were paid less than the minimum wage, and received no holiday pay. Last October, hundreds of factory workers turned up for a rally in a Leicester park, organised by the campaign group Labour Behind the Label, calling for decent working conditions. To try to improve these conditions, Fab-L requires its sponsoring brands sign “workplace support agreements”, which promise to allow community organisers and union reps access to all the factories in their supply chains. The project was launched in January 2022, in response to media reports during and after the pandemic which sparked significant concerns about working conditions in Leicester factories. Many of these are small concerns, employing fewer than 100 workers. “Within our first month, two workers told us they had not been paid for over a month,” Islam said. “It turned out the entire factory hadn’t been paid for a month.” He and representatives from Unite were able to use their access to the fashion brands to put pressure on the factory owner and ensure the workers were paid what they were owed, which totalled £45,000. On a visit to Fab-L at its home in Leicester’s Highfields community centre, Kate Bell, the TUC’s assistant general secretary, said the case underlined the importance of giving unions the right to enter workplaces – ­something Labour has promised as part of its “new deal for working people”. Bell said: “One of the innovative things about these agreements in Leicester is that finally trade unions are able to get in: they’ve got access to some of those workers. If we didn’t have that right, as we don’t across most of the economy, those stories just wouldn’t be being heard.  “Part of Labour’s new deal proposal is around access to workplaces for trade unions, just so people know there’s someone they can talk to, someone they can turn to. And, hopefully, someone who can help them build the ability to speak up for themselves.” A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson defended the government’s record on workers’ rights, insisting that “paying the minimum wage is not optional – it is the law”. They pointed to the 700 fines issued to businesses by HMRC for underpaying their staff in 2021-22. But Bell, who sits on the government’s Low Pay Commission, said unions could play a key role in uncovering abuses. Islam says Fab-L sometimes finds it difficult to explain the point of union membership to workers who are struggling to get by – and may have close community connections with the factory owners they work for. “There has been low union membership in the garment industry for the past 25 years,” he said. “ The thinking is: ‘We don’t know about unions. We don’t see how it can relate. How are we going to be demanding better pay when we’ve only just found work, and we already know that the boss has done us a favour?’” He told of a woman who sought his help in dealing with her landlord after her kitchen ceiling had collapsed. “When people are that vulnerable,” he said, “when people don’t even have access to basic living conditions, you can try to understand why they won’t report issues at work.” Nevertheless, since the start of the project, Islam said, he and colleagues had won workers £160,000 in unpaid or underpaid wages. As well as handing out leaflets offering help and advice in the factories they are able to visit, Islam and fellow organiser Fatimah Li run outreach events, including setting up stalls in local supermarkets. They hold regular English classes, and a drop-in “fashion workers’ club,” where union reps, including local GMB organiser Cassie Farmer, are on hand to offer advice. “Cassie has been here a couple of times where we’ve had an influx of six or seven workers from a specific factory, and they’ve all got some issue,” said Li. She added that even though the brands may be on board, factory owners could be sceptical. “Although it was easy to go into certain factories – with the support of brands, which gave us that access – it was quite challenging once we were there, because the suppliers, the bosses, weren’t very happy about it.” Over time, and with the help of the unions, she and Islam – who have now been joined by a third member of staff – have worked to make the case for their presence. “We weren’t there to police factories; we were there to ensure garment workers had a way to organise themselves and ask the right questions, and make the workplace more worker-friendly,” she said. A Bulgarian worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, described being handed a P45 and then asked to sign a new contract by her boss after taking leave to travel to her home country for dental work. A month later, she said, she was told to go home because there was no work – and she has been waiting anxiously ever since. Unite reps are now working with Fab-L on her case.   Brands support us because it looks good in their annual report, but they’d far rather be somewhere cheap that NGOs can’t monitor  Fatimah Li, Fab-L    Another worker told her story in Hindi by video. Translating, Li said when the woman started work in a factory in April, she was told she could not be given a contract or a payslip because of problems with the computer system. “She agreed to work for £5 an hour because she was desperate and thought it was better to take a job and get in there, then see if there was anything better to come,” Li said. When it came to being paid, “she calculated an estimate of 200 worked hours, but the factory boss said, ‘I’ll pay you for 100, but 100 I want back’.” The worker said the boss then tried to reduce her hourly wage – which was already well below the legal minimum – even further. “She said, ‘You’re forcing me into hardship. What can I do?’,” Li translated. “And he replied, ‘It’s up to you: the door’s open. No one’s forcing you to be here. If you no longer want to be here, you can go out and leave.’” With the support of Fab-L, the woman did leave – for a new job in a different sector. The GMB is working to win back her unpaid wages. Farmer, of the GMB, said the case had been hard to deal with, because the factory in question was not in the supply chain of any of the group’s funders. “I can’t even go in,” she said. Fab-L’s work is taking place at a time of dwindling orders. Union reps and community organisers acknowledge that there is now much less work to go around in the city’s garment sector than there was a few years ago. The rush of “reshoring” that came with Covid as supply chains to China were abruptly severed has been replaced by a fresh wave of outsourcing, including to Morocco. Dominique Muller of Labour Behind the Label said there were concerns that brands were seeking to evade scrutiny – as well as cut costs – by sending work overseas. “In Leicester, we have been building up these mechanisms of accountability,” she said, “and brands are supporting that, because it looks good in their annual report. But they’re now not putting the orders in, because they would far rather be using somewhere really cheap, where NGOs don’t have the ability or the resources to monitor them.” Islam, who comes from a family of garment workers, said despite the shocking working conditions he has been outlining, it would be a bad thing if work continued to be shifted elsewhere. “We believe the garment industry needs to stay,” he said. “We’re only highlighting these challenges to say that these are the things that need to be fixed – and also to show that they are fixable.”"

        "content": "One by one, they stamp all over your dreams. In this election year, the dashed hopes will belong to Rachel Reeves. In 2010 the victim was Alistair Darling. Reeves wants to increase spending on the UK’s crumbling infrastructure should Labour win at the polls. Her commitments have become less ambitious as pressure mounts from mainstream economists and those in high finance worried about current debt levels escalating. The experts who feel the need to pour cold water on higher spending plans avoid direct criticism of Labour’s £28bn green investment package. Instead there is general concern about the level of government debt, supporting Jeremy Hunt’s view that debt must fall, come what may. Such is the weight of argument against Reeves that Labour has scaled down its ambitions, and the investment plan will only reduce, rather than reverse, the dramatic fall in public investment as a proportion of national income mapped out by the current administration over the next five years. Sir Robert Stheeman, who runs the government’s Debt Management Office (DMO), is the latest expert to portray his intervention as a display of technical profundity when in reality it is a swipe at those who want to end a century of underinvestment. Before we hear from Stheeman, it should be remembered that, as governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King set a precedent when he said that Darling’s budget before the 2010 election had not gone far enough to bring down Britain’s debt. It was the boost George Osborne needed to persuade many waverers that Gordon Brown’s government could not be trusted with the nation’s finances.   Clare Lombardelli, the OECD’s chief economist, said that while a few countries have exceptional circumstances, ‘we do need to get debt levels down’   Many economists at the time said there was a clear case for borrowing at historically low interest rates to invest in Britain’s infrastructure and its education, health and welfare systems to raise productivity and national income. But King was joined by the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the major credit ratings agencies, which arbitrate on the value of government debt, in his praise of austerity. They won the day. Stheeman is due to retire next year from the DMO, which acts as the government’s mortgage broker, managing the thousands of bonds that amount to the government’s total borrowings. Last week he warned Financial Times readers that ministers should be wary of provoking a backlash in financial markets by increasing borrowing too quickly. “In a world where we have debt to sell,” he said, “policymaking cannot be divorced from the reality of the market.” Later in the interview, the DMO boss said the current level of borrowing – £2.7tn, or almost 98% of gross domestic product – was manageable, but appeared to argue that £2.8tn or £2.9tn would trigger a panic. He can be forgiven for referring to Liz Truss’s attempt to spend tens of billions on tax cuts almost overnight, paid for with borrowing, when she and Kwasi Kwarteng took control of Downing Street in 2022. But Truss is history and Stheeman was telling us about the future. He will know that Reeves is the future, and his warning shot looks to be aimed at Labour’s spending plans. The DMO boss went on holiday after his interview. A spokesperson said that on his return he would be in pre-budget purdah and questions from the press would have to wait until after 6 March. As the year progresses, other prominent voices will put pressure on the government, and future governments, to reduce borrowing. Clare Lombardelli, the former Treasury official who is now the OECD’s chief economist, said last summer that while a few countries might have exceptional circumstances, “on average, we do need to get debt levels down”. The credit ratings agencies say borrowing levels need to fall and the IMF, amid concerns about inequality and climate resilience, will probably also warn about debt levels. Compared with the aftermath of the 2008 crash, western economies are paying much higher interest rates, which makes investment harder to justify. Nevertheless, the French government has borrowed 112% of GDP and the Spanish 111%, much higher than the UK’s 97.5%. The US has borrowed 120% of GDP, while Italy and Japan are on 142% and 220% respectively. It’s not the level of borrowing that matters so much as what the nation does with the money. That’s where the UK’s reputation falls down. So Labour voters need to accept that the weight of mainstream economic opinion, and a recent history of squandering what money there is limits Reeves’s room for manoeuvre.

        "content": "The limos have been booked. Hotels have loaded up with champagne. Shops have been converted into pop-up offices for the tech giants. The annual Davos talkfest is about to begin. The collective mood of the 2,800 participants is anything but cheery as they make their way to the small Alpine town immortalised by Thomas Mann in his novel The Magic Mountain for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). That’s because there are four “C”s that will dominate this year’s event: conflict; the new cold war; climate; and chaos – or the potential for it, arising as a result of misuse of artificial intelligence by hostile states and criminals. As usual, there will be plenty of partying and business deals clinched behind closed doors, but the WEF’s dream of a peaceful, prosperous, globalised world have been shattered by recent developments. Klaus Schwab has been “Mr Davos” since he set up the forum in the early 1970s and is still the organisation’s executive chairman. He said last week: “We face a fractured world and growing societal divides, leading to pervasive uncertainty and pessimism. We have to rebuild trust in our future by moving beyond crisis management, looking at the root causes of the present problems, and building together a more promising future.” Attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Iranian-backed Houthi fighters have highlighted the risks of the war between Israel and Hamas escalating into a broader Middle East conflict. So far, fears that the 7 October attacks would lead to a repeat of the 1973 energy shock – a fourfold increase in the cost of crude – have proved unfounded, in part because demand for oil has been weak, but also because the fighting has largely been confined to Gaza. The lengthy re-routing of cargo ships around the Cape of Good Hope has provided a hint of what could happen were the war to spread to Lebanon.   The WEF’s annual global risks report was dominated by fears that AI will be used for nefarious purposes   Events in the Middle East have meant less attention has been paid in recent months to the war between Ukraine and Russia, which will soon enter a third year. Ukraine and Switzerland will host about 120 national security advisers on Sunday in Davos, in the latest in a series of meetings to rally support for Kyiv’s peace plan. But with Russia not involved in the talks, there is little chance of the conflict ending, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will urge the international community to step up supplies of military equipment when he speaks to the WEF on Tuesday. The UK on Friday announced an increase in its military aid to £2.5bn from April, £200m more than previous years. Zelenskiy is one of more than 60 heads of state and government at this year’s Davos: a list that also includes France’s Emmanuel Macron and Argentina’s new libertarian president, Javier Milei. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, will not be attending but Beijing will still be sending a big delegation headed by premier Li Qiang. Li’s speech will be carefully analysed for any signs of a thawing in the increasingly frosty relationship between China and the US. Two risks that once seemed to be clouds on the distant horizon have now become immediate dangers. The WEF’s annual global risks report was dominated by fears that AI – a technology that has advanced rapidly since last year’s Davos – will be used for nefarious purposes, and that time is running out to prevent global heating reaching a tipping point. It is not all bad news. A year ago, there were fears of a protracted and painful recession as central banks raised interest rates in response to the highest inflation in the west in four decades. At the start of 2024, inflation is coming down and financial markets are anticipating cuts in official borrowing costs. Although the eurozone and the UK may still suffer technical recessions, the pain looks like being short-lived. Even so, any optimism will be guarded. In the past four years, the global economy has been beset by Covid, a cost of living crisis and war. At Davos 2024, the talk over the canapés will be of what can go wrong next."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-13T08:00:12+00:00",
        "content": "EDF has left customers on its Economy 7 tariff wondering how they will be able to heat their homes this winter after the energy supplier almost doubled the price of its off-peak night-time rate. On 1 January, most home energy users in Great Britain saw their bills rise by an average of 5% after the regulator Ofgem raised the price cap. However, at the same time EDF pushed through a 91% increase in its E7 night-time rate. Households that rely on Economy 7 have always paid a much cheaper rate to recharge their storage or water heaters through the night, and a more expensive daytime rate for electricity. Users tend to be living in purpose-built flats, or older-style social housing without a gas connection – and are often on lower incomes. They were traditionally rewarded for using off-peak electricity produced when demand was low. Tim Burton, who lives in rural Norfolk, told the Guardian that EDF had almost doubled the price he and others in the eastern region pay for their night-time electricity from 8.5p to 16.6p a kilowatt hour (kWh). It is a similar story across the country. Households on standard variable tariffs with EDF are typically charged about 30p/kWh at any time of day and night if they pay by direct debit. EDF has cut the E7 day rate to an average of 35.8p/kWh, but customers on the tariff say the price rise at night will more than offset any savings from that reduction. “Each year 75% of our electricity is used for heating our home. So our recent price rise is not the routinely reported 5% but a massive hike of 38%,” Burton said. “We feel as minority energy users living in a rural area our plight is being overlooked and our situation is being exploited by energy companies. To avoid an unsustainable annual energy bill we should ideally be investing in a heat pump. But this would require us to install a costly radiator system from scratch; and since my wife and myself are both 70 we would be highly unlikely to recoup this cost.” Matthew Brown from St Albans said he was “reeling” after the EDF move and worried that his bill would double over the winter months. “The cut in day time rate does not help. My flat uses Economy 7 and storage heaters, so my radiator and water heating is all at night,” he said. “I’m seeing daily costs of £3-£6 by 7am.” Some of those affected only switched to EDF in recent months after investing in home batteries to take advantage of the night-time rate, which was one of the cheapest on the market. Customers have questioned how EDF is still charging electric car owners just 8p/kWh for their night-time usage, while it had nearly doubled their rate. Electric car tariffs are only available to those with an electric vehicle. An EDF spokesperson said it had taken the difficult decision to increase the overnight rates to reflect supply costs. “Our standard variable prices are regulated by the price cap, which Ofgem sets based on its view of the cost to supply. The cost to supply has increased significantly in recent years and during this time we’ve worked hard to keep our prices as low as possible for our customers,” they said. “The updated prices are still within Ofgem’s price cap, and as part of this change, we decreased the peak/daytime rates from January. We recognise the impact of the energy crisis on our customers and strive to maintain competitive prices.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-12T17:50:33+00:00",
        "content": "Aviation is an abundant source of metaphors, but not always as self-generating as the terrifying Alaska Airlines incident that has once again brought Boeing low: a hole blown in the side of an ascending plane, a gap that was not properly plugged, passengers staring into the void. The safe landing of flight 1282 on 5 January after a boy literally lost the shirt from his back as the air was sucked out at 14,000 feet, means Boeing can count itself lucky that it does not face far worse than the Federal Aviation Administration investigation and a further audit announced this week and a handful of lawsuits from distressed passengers. Only one variant of Boeing’s 737 Max model, the Max 9 with a sealed mid-rear exit door, has been grounded, pending inspections. The FAA will now try to determine whether Boeing failed to ensure its planes met the designs and were “in a condition for safe operation”. The National Transportation Safety Board’s accident investigators will be examining the missing chunk of fuselage found in an Oregon teacher’s back yard. And airlines and investors will be wondering more broadly, just who is failing to tighten the bolts at Boeing? In an industry where every chief executive likes to intone that safety is the No 1 priority, Boeing has had to redouble efforts since the 737 Max disasters of 2018-19. Two crashes that killed 346 people led to the model being grounded worldwide for about 20 months and the exposure of internal company communications that suggested concerns were being suppressed in the race to fend off rival Airbus and produce a cheaper, more fuel-efficient single-aisle plane. Since then, the last company to want to be seen skirting near the edge on safety would be Boeing – and the chief executive Dave Calhoun’s, acceptance of responsibility for the “quality escape” over the door plug blowout was broadly welcomed, even if there was little chance of blaming anyone else this time. So what has gone wrong? Or rather – what has not been fixed? Boeing and regulators will be looking for the immediate defect at the company’s production and assembly plant in Seattle, Washington, and that of a leading supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in Wichita, Kansas. While the 737 Max 8 is Boeing’s top selling plane, the Max 9 is rare outside the US, with Alaska and United owning 144 of the 215 made. The US carriers operate the now grounded Max 9 variant with the mid-rear cabin door sealed, but airlines that have installed the maximum number of seats and are therefore required to have the door in operation under safety rules, can continue to fly. Boeing will hope that any defect discovered has no bearing on other Max versions – or further reputational damage beyond. However, the manufacturer issued three warnings about 737 Max production defects in 2023, the latest just a week before the Alaska incident. If you find loose nuts in a rudder, and then in a door plug panel, at what point does it start to look like a systemic issue? “The fact that there are loose bolts in young aircraft, not long off the production line, means they are going to have to look at processes and quality management as part of their investigation,” says John Strickland an aviation expert at JLS Consulting. Regulators are in no hurry. “The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning the Boeing 737 Max 9 to service,” the FAA said. On Friday, the agency went further, announcing an audit of the production line and suppliers, saying it believed there were “other manufacturing problems” at Boeing – a move that “suggests that the FAA has real safety concerns for the flying public”, says Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “While the probe is ongoing, Boeing may continue to experience damage to its profitability and reputation, which it may have difficulty limiting.” And Boeing, of course, has horrific previous. A congressional report blamed a “culture of concealment” for the fatal Max 737 crashes, which led to Boeing paying more than $2.5bn (£2bn) to settle legal claims in victim compensation and US fines as well as charges that it misled investors over concerns for the plane. Strickland, part of a small group invited to tour Boeing HQ in Seattle when the Max was still grounded worldwide, says: “There’s no doubt from what we saw at the end of 2019 that they were making big steps to address processes and corporate culture.” A flight safety centre aimed to expose all staff to their responsibility, “showing air crashes over the years as a reminder of the lives lost and the causes”, while representatives stressed a focus on transparency and enabling whistleblowing for any concerns. Beyond the horrors of the crashes, Boeing has also struggled with faltering production rates. “There is a lot of commercial pressure to step up production to get planes out of the order book – which is not ever a justification for lesser quality or errors,” Strickland says. “But the pressure is there to get back to quality on time production, instead of late delivery.” The pandemic may have played a part, he adds: “Across the industry, skilled staff were lost – and Boeing was no exception.” A recurrent criticism has been that for too long Boeing prioritised dividends to investors over the job of designing and building planes. The elevation of Stephanie Pope to the new role of chief operating officer at the start of the year may not allay concerns about the hierarchy of engineering. Pope, widely seen as Calhoun’s most probable successor, has spent 30 years at the company but primarily on the financial side. Since 2018, Boeing has not recorded an annual profit – and has fallen further behind Airbus in the pivotal short-haul single-aisle aircraft market. On Thursday, the European manufacturer announced it had delivered 735 commercial aircraft in 2023, an 11% increase on 2022, and taken 1,835 orders for its 737 equivalent, the A320 family of planes. Boeing can take solace in that its rival has ridden out its own scandals, multibillion-dollar fines, and smaller product mishaps, such as cracks in A380 wings. For now, the US aerospace company’s share price has only fallen 10%, and the order book remains large. Europe’s biggest carrier, Ryanair, opted to throw in its lot with Boeing and doubled down after the Max disasters, with a giant order at an undisclosed discount to reflect the plane’s tarnished status. The Irish airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has only railed at slow delivery of his promised Max 10s, and is relaxed on any consumer backlash: no customer, he said, had ever opted to take the refund or free switch that Ryanair offered for those who did not want to fly on a 737 Max."

        "content": "Kazakhstan’s national airline has announced plans to float on the London stock market, bringing a potential windfall to BAE Systems, which has been an investor for more than two decades. Air Astana, which is 49% owned by the British defence company, hopes to list in London and Kazakhstan and raise $120m (£94m). The airline, which is majority owned by the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund, did not say how much of the company would be floated and is yet to confirm an expected valuation range. The float, which has been years in the making, could offer a cash boost to BAE Systems, which manufactures fighter jets, submarines and warships, and acquired its stake via an unusual route. The company was pursuing a deal to sell its radar systems to the Kazakh military in 2001 and as part of the deal it agreed to help fund the launch of Air Astana through a $8.5m agreement. The radar deal fell through, reportedly under pressure from Russia, but BAE’s interest in the airline remained, and the investment was valued at £63m by the company last year. The listing offers a rare bright spot for London’s stock market, which has experienced a dearth of floats in recent years. The City is struggling to compete with overseas rivals to land big flotations, and one of last year’s biggest, the natural soda ash producer We Soda, was abandoned because of a disappointing valuation. Air Astana intends to use the proceeds of the twin listing to invest in expanding in its fleet and putting on more flights. It already flies to destinations across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including key transport hubs such as London, Amsterdam and Seoul. Its board is chaired by Nurlan Zhakupov, a Kazakh citizen who was previously the managing director of the Kazakh mining company Tau-Ken Samruk and later chief executive of the Kazakhstan Investment Development Fund. The company has three Britons on its board, including its chief executive, Peter Foster, who ran Royal Brunei Airlines before taking over at Air Astana in 2005. Foster said: “We are confident that the initial public offering will accelerate the next stage of growth for the Air Astana Group, and we see significant opportunities to thicken our existing routes and expand into new geographic areas, supported by our continued fleet expansion plan and initiatives to increase operational flexibility.” The former Soviet country has privatised a number of state-owned assets over the last decade, including national oil and gas, electricity and nuclear entities. If the listing is completed, it will bring a payday for bankers working on the deal at Citigroup and Jefferies."

        "content": "Supermarkets are agreeing to accept smaller than usual cauliflowers, sprouts, cabbages and leeks as farmers struggle to cope with poor weather and flooding around the UK. The move to keep fresh British produce on the shelves comes after heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding, which started in late autumn and continued through Christmas and the new year, affecting growers mainly in Lincolnshire, East Anglia, Cornwall and Scotland. Poor weather and higher costs of fertiliser, energy and labour have all contributed to higher prices and tight supplies of many vegetables in the UK. The price of carrots and brussels sprouts was up by more than 150% year on year and potatoes by 45% before supermarkets brought in special Christmas discounts. Farmers have predicted there could be shortages in the spring after fields were washed out and the cost of heating greenhouses has meant many growers have delayed planting. The British potato crop was expected to hit its lowest ever level at 4.1m tonnes. Supplies of salad crops, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and aubergines, may also be affected as British growers said they had delayed planting because the high cost of energy was not being covered by supermarkets. “Cold weather means burning more gas, and low light levels mean plants grow more slowly. The price we are getting is still not enough to plant early,” said Lee Stiles, the secretary of the Lea Valley Growers’ Association, an area known as London’s “salad bowl”. Last year supermarkets were forced to ration some salad ingredients amid gaps on shelves as glasshouse-grown crops from the UK and the Netherlands were in short supply and Spanish crops were hit by droughts. One of the biggest growers of winter vegetables in Lincolnshire, TH Clements, said it had only had a handful of dry days since October, which had made harvesting extremely difficult. John Moulding, the commercial director of TH Clements, said: “This is the worst flooding we have had this century and we have lost about 20% of our total winter crops, including sprouts, cabbages, cauliflower and leaks. It’s been a very tough time for us for more than three months, both physically and financially in having to pull the vegetables out of the muddy fields. He said flexibility from Tesco had allowed the company to get more products on to shelves. “We have literally had to race against the clock to get the vegetables pulled out of the ground to stop them from rotting.” This week Ken Murphy, the chief executive of Tesco, said the supermarket had worked with growers in Scotland to help keep sprouts on the shelf before Christmas by agreeing that the crop could be harvested slightly earlier than planned. It meant the sprouts were slightly smaller than usual but gave time for them to be dried by using cool air blowers to blow the water off them in their storage pallets. Tom Mackintosh, the fresh produce and horticulture director at Tesco, said: “By accepting slightly smaller sprouts, cauliflower, cabbages and leeks, we can support the fresh produce industry while ensuring that customers are able to continue to buy British winter vegetables.” A spokesperson for Morrisons said: “The recent weather has clearly been very challenging for the UK farming industry and to support our growing partners we have made adjustments to specifications to allow cosmetic blemishes that do not detract from quality. These specification changes ensure both availability of our excellent British vegetables such as sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, greens and onions as well as a fair return to UK farmers.” The company added that its “wonky veg” range of 10 products that did not meet typical supermarket standards including carrots, parsnips and potatoes, sold 36m packs a year, with sales up by more than 10% on last year. Sainsbury’s said it was also accepting vegetables, including sprouts, onions, potatoes and cabbages that may be under- or oversized, or slightly misshapen, in order to avoid food waste. Martin Emmett, the National Farmers’ Union’s horticulture and potatoes board chair, said: “The recent poor weather, flooding and heavy rain has disrupted the growth and harvesting of some vegetable crops, such as potatoes, since land became waterlogged or flooded. “We have no expectations of shortages currently, but it remains important that we make the best of what’s available, with supermarkets offering flexibility to growers when it comes to crop specification. In doing so, the food chain from farm to plate will avoid unnecessary food waste.”"

        "content": "Citigroup will cut 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026 after enduring a steep loss in the last quarter as it presses ahead with a sweeping restructuring.   Related: Wall Street bank bosses warn Congress that new rules risk hurting US economy   While chief executive, Jane Fraser, hailed 2024 as a “turning point” for the American banking group, Mark Mason, its chief financial officer, acknowledged that job cuts were “tough on morale” as he outlined the planned reductions. Citi currently has 239,000 staff across the world. The lender plans to reduce this by 20,000 as part of a reorganisation, Mason said. Executives ultimately expect the workforce to shrink to about 180,000 employees, as the upcoming listing of Banamex, Citi’s Mexican consumer division, is also set to reduce staffing levels by about 40,000. As the latest quarterly earnings season got under way on Wall Street on Friday, Citi posted a $1.8bn loss for the fourth quarter, after recording a string of one-off charges and expenses – $3.8bn in total – tied to its restructuring, retreat from Russia and exposure to Argentina. “While the fourth quarter was very disappointing due to the impact of notable items, we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing our strategy in 2023,” said Fraser. Shares in Citi, the third largest bank in the US, were 0.4% higher during early trading in New York. The lender, which has a market valuation of $100bn, is in the midst of a drive to boost profits, reduce bureaucracy and increase its stock price. It came as JPMorgan Chase, America’s third biggest bank, reported its best-ever annual profit despite a charge in the last quarter to top up a US government deposit insurance fund in the wake of the failure of several regional lenders, including Silicon Valley Bank, last year. Profits at JPMorgan dropped 15% in the fourth quarter to $9.31bn. Its earnings surged 32% over the year, however, to $49.6bn. The lender has benefited from higher interest rates, and its acquisition of First Republic, one of the regional banks that failed last year. JPMorgan boosted analysts’ expectations for net interest income – the gap between what it makes on loans and pays out on deposits – projecting the measure to hit $90bn this year. “The US economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and markets currently expect a soft landing” as inflation moderates, Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, said.  But there remained “a number of downside risks,” cautioned Dimon. “While we hope for the best, the past year demonstrated why we must be prepared for any environment.” Shares in JPMorgan rose 0.6% on Friday."

United Airlines are the top faller on the S&P 500, down 8.6%, followed by American Airlines (-8.2%) and Delta Air Lines (-7.9%). The selloff came after Delta predicts its adjusted earnings will be $6 to $7 a share this year, rather than hitting its long-term profit target of over $7. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains:  Airlines are lower after Delta Airlines adjusted its 2024 profit targets lower due to concerns over higher costs saying it expects full year profits to come in between $6 to $7 a share, below the previous estimate of more than $7. Q4 revenues came in at $14.22bn and profits came in at $1.28c a share.  Cruise operators are also down, with Norwegian Cruise Line (-4%) and Carnival (-3.8%) among the main fallers on the S&P 500.  Updated at 3.45pm GMT    3.15pm GMT   Over in the US, producers trimmed their prices last month, in a sign that inflationary pressures are easing. The US Producer Prices Index fell by 0.1% month-on-month in December, thanks to a 1.2% monthly drop in energy prices and a 0.9% drop in food. Overall, wholesale goods prices dropped by 0.4% while services price were unchanged.

Hafnia said the decision was made after an advisory from the Combined Maritime Forces to stay clear of the region, after the launch of U.S. and British air strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen. Hafnia says it is the world’s largest tanker company, with 206 vessels in its fleet.  Updated at 3.08pm GMT    1.55pm GMT   Back on Wall Street, Citigroup has reported a $1.8bn loss for the last quarter of 2023. Earnings were hit by $1.3bn being set aside to cover risks related to Russia and Argentina, and an $880m hit from the devaluation of the Argentinian peso last year. Citi is also paying $1.7bn into the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, through the levy to recapitalise this fund after the regional banking crisis last year. Also, there is a $780m restructuring charge, as Citi looks to eliminate up to 20,000 jobs. Reuters explains:  The bank announced it will reduce its headcount by 20,000 people over the medium term, the first time it estimated the workforce effect of its reorganization plan. Citi said it expects to book charges between $700 million and $1 billion tied to the severance and reorganization.  Chief executive officer Jane Fraser said the fourth quarter was “very disappointing,” adding:  “Given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures, 2024 will be a turning point.”      12.49pm GMT   NIESR, the economic forecasters, have predicted the UK economy will return to growth in the first quarter of this year. They also expect stagnation in the final quarter of last year – which would mean Britain just avoids a technical recession. NIESR say:  We estimate that GDP flatlined in the fourth quarter of 2023, and forecast GDP to grow by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024. These forecasts remain broadly consistent with the longer-term trend of low, but stable economic growth in the United Kingdom.   ⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest #GDP Tracker suggests UK GDP is set to grow by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024 after flatlining in the last quarter of 2023 📈Read here in full ⬇️#GDPgrowth #UKeconomy #EconTwitterhttps://t.co/aE0PloW0U2 pic.twitter.com/66Ub1dhl3q— National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) January 12, 2024      12.24pm GMT   The head of JP Morgan has warned of the risk of disruption from wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan, cited both conflicts today, as the Wall Street bank reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Dimon also pointed to the government bond sales by central banks (quantitative tightening) as they unwind their simulus packages. He said:  Quantitative tightening is draining over $900 billion of liquidity from the system annually, and we have never seen a full cycle of tightening. And the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. While we hope for the best, the past year demonstrated why we must be prepared for any environment.  JP Morgan reported net income of $9.3bn for Q4 2023, down from $13.1bn in Q3. Its earnings were hit by a $2.9bn payment to US bank regulators to refill the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) fund, which was drained by the collapse of several regional lenders last year.     12.04pm GMT    As tensions escalate in the Middle East, the cost of oil has been steadily climbing.

They add:  The decision is in line with notices from industry trade groups who’ve said that military guidance is to avoid the area. Torm owns a fleet of about 80 ships.      11.35am GMT   At least four oil tankers have diverted course from the Red Sea since overnight strikes by the U.S. and Britain on Houthi targets in Yemen, according to Reuters, citing shipping data from LSEG and Kpler. They add:  The tankers Toya, Diyyinah-I, Stolt Zulu and Navig8 Pride LHJ were all seen turning around mid-voyage in order to avoid the Red Sea between 0300 and 0730 GMT on Friday, according to ship tracking from the two companies. One of the tankers, Toya, a very large crude carrier capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of oil, was unladen, the data showed. The other three vessels are fuel tankers.      11.17am GMT   Allianz Trade, the international insurance company, believe the Red Sea crisis is not, yet, not a red flag for the global economy. In a new research note, they point out that while shipping has been disrupted, prices are still some way below their levels when the Covid-19 pandemic hurt supply chains. Ana Boata, head of macroeconomic research at Allianz Trade, says:  Due to the attacks, shipping volume in the Suez Canal declined by -15% year-on-year in the ten days leading up to Jan 7, while it dropped by -53% in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait leading into the Red Sea. The number of cargo ships decreased by -30% for cargo and -19% for tankers via the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, during the same period, shipping volume around the Cape of Good Hope nearly doubled, with cargo ships increasing by +66% and tankers by +65%. Although shipping prices and especially container freight prices have increased significantly since November 2023 (+240% as of early January - see Figure1), prices are only a quarter of the peak seen in 2021 and as the demand backdrop remains weak, inventories are higher in most consumer good segments and the shipping sector has built up more capacities with new containerships, the upside risk seems lower today than in 2021.  Boata also explains how the Red Sea crisis could push up inflation, and hurt growth.  Unsurprisingly, the impact from rising shipping costs on inflation is highest in Europe and the US where a doubling of shipping costs pushes inflation up by +0.7pp (percentage points) compared to +0.3pp for China. For global inflation, this would mean an increase of +0.5pp to 5.1% in 2024. For GDP growth this could translate into -0.9pp for Europe and -0.6pp for the US. This could translate into a loss of -0.4pp to global GDP growth to 2%.      10.47am GMT  Brent crude hits $80 for first time this year  Newsflash: the Brent crude oil price has hit $80 per barrel for the first time since 27th December. Brent is now up almost 3.5% today at $80.10, after the US and UK attacks on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen overnight.  *BRENT OIL HITS $80 AFTER AIRSTRIKES TARGET YEMEN'S HOUTHIS— IG (@IGcom) January 12, 2024  Analysts at Saxo say:  Oil prices surged back to upper end of the current range, in Brent around $80, after the US and UK launched airstrikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, and Iran also raised stakes as its Navy captured an oil tanker off the coast of Oman.      10.36am GMT   The gold price, often a safe-haven in troubled times, has risen a little today. Gold is up 0.6% at $2,040 per ounce. Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, says the airstrikes against Yemen have boosted oil and gold.  With tensions in the Middle East already sky-high, this military strike fanned fears about a broader escalation in the region, which translated into a boost for oil and gold prices.  That said, this conflict has had little direct impact on oil production so far, so it’s questionable whether such concerns will support prices for long without further escalation that actually takes some crude barrels offline.      10.18am GMT   Shares in aerospace and defence companies are rising today too. Weapons and combat vehicle maker BAE Systems has jumped 1.6% in London this morning. Rolls-Royce, which makes and services military engines, is up 2%. French aircraft equipment manufacturer Safran, which makes landing gear, wheels, brakes, wiring, avionics and navigation systems, are up 3.1% in Paris. Airbus, which makes military aircraft, are up 2.4%, while Thales – which makes a range of defence products – are 1.4% higher.  Updated at 10.18am GMT    9.52am GMT   Oil could keep rising if tensions escalate further in the Middle East, warns Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades: Evangelista explains:  Brent oil prices rose more than 3% over the last 24 hours as the markets reacted to an attack by British and American forces on Houthi targets in Yemen. The strikes came as a response to the militants’ attacks on transport ships crossing the Strait of Hormuz in the Red Sea, which they claim to be a legitimate form to pressurise Israel to halt operations in Gaza. This attack is another escalation in the tensions that have been simmering in the Middle East since the October 7 Hamas attack, and the markets are reacting with apprehension. The Red Sea route, which leads to the Suez Canal, is crossed by the main shipping lanes between Asia and the West and is the main export route for Gulf oil. With one of the most critical oil supply channels to the West under threat, it is not surprising to see crude prices rising in a dynamic that could create further upside for the price of the barrel should tensions continue to escalate in the Middle East.  Such an outcome would worry central bankers, as it would undermine efforts to bring down inflation to levels where interest rates can safely be cut….     9.44am GMT  Oil up as Middle East tensions increase  Oil is trading at its highest level in two weeks this morning, following the US and UK attacks on Houthi military targets in Yemen. Brent crude, the industry benchmark, has jumped by 2.3% so far today to around $79.30 per barrel, its highest level since 28 December. Oil had surged over $90 per barrel in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks. It then slipped towards the end of last year on forecasts of weak economic growth in 2024, meaning less demand for energy Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  Brent crude has risen more than 2% to over $79 a barrel, as geopolitical tensions increase in the Middle East. Iran has captured an oil tanker off the coast of Oman in response to sanctions, according to reports. Air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen have also increased anxiety.  As flagged earlier (see here), Tesla is suspending most car production at its factory near Berlin for two weeks, due to delays to component shipments caused by attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. Those tensions have prompted shipping firms to take the longer route around Africa, leading to delays.   Related: Who are the Houthis and how did the US and UK strikes on Yemen come about?   Fusion Risk Management director of Third Party Risk Management Wes Loeffler warns that other firms will encounter similar problems, saying:  Organisations that have not established redundancies within their supply chains are likely to encounter delays, disruptions, or difficulties in procuring essential components that are necessary for delivering goods and services.      8.55am GMT   Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens’ College, Cambridge and chief economic adviser at the financial giant Allianz, has also warned the UK “might have slipped into a slight technical recession in the second half of 2023”.  Powered by the services sector and also retail, the #UK economy grew by 0.3% in November.This is better than the consensus forecast of 0.2%, reverses the 0.3% GDP fall in October, but doesn’t yet exclude the possibility that the #economy might have slipped into a slight…— Mohamed A.

They say:  The BBC understands the Treasury has modelled scenarios including crude oil prices rising by more than $10 a barrel and a 25% increase in natural gas. The government fears if the disruption to cargo traffic spreads to tanker traffic then another energy shock is possible.  Here’s the BBC’s Faisal Islam:  The impact from Red Sea cargo trade rerouting has been disruptive but not crisis-inducing… if the disruption spreads to Gulf/ Straits of Hormuz tankers (of oil AND gas) then that could well prompt a more serious spike in energy prices/ renewed & prolonged inflation shock…— Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) January 12, 2024   Europe and the world is now more dependent on especially Qatari exports of Liquefied Natural Gas, because the Russian pipelines have been switched off - they all come through the Straits of Hormuz— Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) January 12, 2024  As flagged earlier, the Brent crude oil price has jumped around 2% this morning, to $79 per barrel. That’s a two-week high, but still lower than the highs over $120/barrel seen after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in spring 2022.     8.45am GMT   Goldman Sachs has lowered its forecast for Britain’s 2024 economic growth forecast to 0.5% from an earlier expectation of 0.6%, Reuters reports.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:  “Today’s figures only confirm what workers see and hear every single day. Our economy needs intensive care as the result of low investment, crumbling infrastructure and a cost-of-living crisis which makes daily life unaffordable.  “This is a result of choices made by our politicians over many years.

New work decreased by 3.6% in the three months to November, including a 6.9% drop in activity in private new housebuilding. That highlights the slowdown in housebuilding last year – with Persimmon reporting a 33% drop in completions earlier this week. But, repair and maintenance rose by 3.8% in September-November. So overall, monthly construction output is estimated to have fallen by 0.6% in the three months to November compared with the three months to August.  In November alone, new work fell by 2.0%, while repair and maintenance increased by 2.1%.  The construction sector fell by 0.2% in Nov 2023. 3 out of 9 of the construction sectors saw a fall in output.

Over in the City, shares in luxury goods maker Burberry tumbled by 10% at the start of trading, after it warned that demand was slowing. Burberry told shareholders this morning that adjusted operating profit for the financial year to 30 March 2024 will be below its previous guidance. Profits are now expected to be between £410m to £460m, as “the slowdown in luxury demand is having an impact on current trading”. Back in November, Burberry said they would be at the lower end of the consensus forecast range of £552mn to £668mn.  Jonathan Akeroyd, Burberry’s chief executive officer, told shareholders:  “We are continuing to deliver the transition to our new modern British luxury creative expression for Burberry which started appearing in our stores in early Autumn. We are still in the early stages of executing on this, which has become more challenging against the backdrop of slowing luxury demand. We experienced a further deceleration in our key December trading period and we now expect our full year results to be below our previous guidanc      8.10am GMT   The UK continued its “economic hokey cokey in November”, says Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Wealth Club, with 0.3% growth in GDP following the 0.3% fall in October. Hyett adds:  With weakness in travel and hospitality, there is evidence that the cost of living crisis continues to squeeze consumers. But, high tech service industries seem to be picking up the slack, and even manufacturing is showing some signs of life, with its first positive growth since June 2023. It’s an economic muddle, albeit with some promising signs.      8.07am GMT  Resolution Foundation: Stronger than expected growth in November gives a fighting chance of avoiding recession  Britain’s stronger than expected growth in November gives “a fighting chance” of avoiding recession, says the Resolution Foundation. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, explains:  “The economy grew more strongly than expected between October and November, driven by a recovery in our services sector including strong black Friday retail sales and a high performing ICT sector, making it less likely that Britain will fall into recession. “The final verdict on 2023 will come next month, but it is essential that Britain builds some economic momentum in 2024.”      7.56am GMT  Economists: UK still at risk of technical recession.  Several economists are warning that the UK could have slid into a technical recession at the end of last year, even though the economy grew by 0.3% in November. Britian would be in a technical recession if growth contracted in October-December for the second quarter running. A technical recession would be a blow to the government ahead of the next election, even though the ONS are arguing that two small drops in quarterly GDP are not a full-blown downturn, as covered earlier. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, says strike action in December will have hit GDP at the end of last year:   “The economic outlook currently remains gloomy, with a technical recession still potentially on the cards in the second half of 2023, especially given the expected impact from the industrial action in December. Nonetheless, even if the economy manages to avoid a recession, it is expected to remain in stagnation territory.  Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, says the UK remains on the brink of recession, as high interest rates hit growth:  “The UK economy grew by a modestly positive 0.3% month-on-month in November, up from the unexpected 0.3% contraction seen in October. This uplift in November is just enough to bring the UK economy back to flat growth over these two months, but it leaves an awful lot of pressure on the December figures as even a slight downward turn would result in the UK entering a technical recession after Q3 GDP was revised down to a fall of 0.1% at the end of last year. “This morning’s figure shows just how precarious the situation is for the UK economy and piles yet more pressure onto the Bank of England to cut interest rates. The Bank has managed not to tip the UK into a recession to date, but it is looking increasingly likely that its luck may be coming to an end.  Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, says the case for cutting UK interest rates soon is growing, as the economy struggles to gain momentum.  “November’s rebound may have been insufficient to prevent a small technical recession at the end of 2023, with the cost-of-living squeeze and high borrowing costs likely to have constrained output in December. “The UK is facing a notably difficult 2024 with the lagged impact of previous interest rate rises, weaker consumer demand and moderately higher unemployment likely to stifle economic activity, despite a boost from lower inflation. “This lacklustre GDP outturn means that interest rates will remain on hold next month. With the UK teetering on the brink of recession and inflation slowing, the case for loosening policy sooner rather than later is growing.”  Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, agrees that the economy may have contracted in Q4.   “The UK economy returned to growth in November, although this may not prevent the fourth quarter of 2023 being another one of contraction.  Whether the economy slides into a mild recession or not is unlikely to matter too much, but there is not much momentum moving into 2024.  However, given the inflation and interest rate pressures, this is a creditable performance and with rate cuts in the pipeline and an election looming, there is some stimulus on the way.”      7.46am GMT   Rachel Reeves MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the latest GDP figures, saying:  “The Conservatives have presided over 14 years of economic failure that has left working people worse off. A decade of low economic growth has left Britain with the highest tax burden in 70 years, with families set to be £1,200 a year worse off under the Tories’ tax plans. It’s time for change. Rishi Sunak should call an election and give the people the chance to vote for a Labour government that will get Britain’s future back.”      7.45am GMT  UK GDP: the key charts  These charts from the ONS show how the economy fared up to November:     7.41am GMT  Hunt welcome rise in November GDP  Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has welcomed the news that the UK economy returned to growth in November. Hunt points out that efforts to slow inflation (such as high interest rates) weighed on the economy, saying:  “While growth in November is welcome news, it will be slower as we bring inflation back to its 2% target. But we have seen that advanced economies with lower taxes have grown more rapidly, so our tax cuts for businesses and workers put the UK in a strong position for growth into the future.”      7.40am GMT  ONS chief economist on recession risks  Q: What needs to happen for the UK to avoid shrinking in the fourth quarter of 2023, putting the economy into recession? ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner says “everyone is obsessed” whether the Q4 GDP reading is slightly positive or slightly negative. That data is due in a month’s time, when we also discover how the economy fared in December. The UK would be in a ‘technical recession’ if Q4 GDP was negative, given Q3 GDP fell by 0.1%. Fitzner, though, explains that an actual recession is more serious than just two small falls in quarterly GDP in a row [although this is a widely-held definition]. He told Radio 4’s Today Programme:  It’s important to remember that a recession is not simply a very small negative number followed by another very small negative number. It’s a significant and sustained fall in output. We don’t expect to see that.  If December’s GDP is flat or positive, and there are no revisions to previous months, the UK might avoid a negative quarter in Q4, Fitzner adds.     7.31am GMT   The 0.2% drop in construction output in November was driven by falling housebuilding activity, Grant Fitzner explains.     7.27am GMT   The UK economy received a boost from Black Friday spending in November. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner is on Radio 4’s Today programme, explaining that “We have had quite a number of companies telling us they saw strong Black Friday sales”. That had a positive impact not just on the retail sector, but also warehousing and couriers. Fewer strikes in health and transport than earlier in 2023 also helped the economy, as did the end of the Hollywood strikes, Fitzner adds.     7.10am GMT   Here’s ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner on this morning’s GDP report:  “The economy contracted a little over the three months to November, with widespread falls across manufacturing industries, which were partially offset by increases in public services, which saw less impact from strike action. GDP bounced back in the month of November, however, led by services with retail, car leasing and computer games companies all having a buoyant month.The longer-term picture remains one of an economy that has shown little growth over the last year.”      7.08am GMT  But economy shrank in September-November  Despite the pick-up in growth in November, the UK economy shrank in the three months from September to November. GDP in the three months to November fell by 0.2%, compared with the three months to August 2023. Services showed no growth, production output fell by 1.5% and construction fell by 0.6% over the period, the Office for National Statistics reports.

That’s slightly stronger than the 0.2% growth which City economists expected. It follows the 0.3% contraction in October. The Office for National Statistics reports that the UK’s services sector provided the bulk of the growth in November. Here’s the details:  Services output grew by 0.4% in November 2023 and was the main contributor to the monthly growth in GDP; this follows a fall of 0.1% in October 2023 (revised up from a 0.2% fall). Production output grew by 0.3% in November 2023, following a fall of 1.3% in October (revised down from a 0.8% fall). The construction sector fell by 0.2% in November 2023 after a fall of 0.4% in October 2023 (revised up from a 0.5% fall).      6.51am GMT  Reuters: Tesla Berlin to stop most output for two weeks due to Red Sea disruption  Delays to deliveries to components due to the attacks on ships in the Red Sea will force Tesla to suspend most car production at its factory near Berlin for two weeks, Reuters reports. The partial production stop will run from 29 January to 11 February, and highlights the risks that rising geopolitical tensions pose to the economy. Reuters explains:  The partial production stop is evidence that the crisis in the Red Sea, unleashed by Iranian-backed Houthi militants attacking vessels in solidarity with Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fighting Israel in Gaza, has hit Europe’s largest economy. The U.S. electric vehicle maker is the first company to disclose an interruption to output due to the disruption. Many companies including Geely, China’s second-largest automaker by sales, and Swedish home furnishing company Ikea have warned of delays to deliveries. “The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are also having an impact on production in Gruenheide,” Tesla said in a statement.   Exclusive: Tesla Berlin to stop most output for two weeks due to Red Sea disruption https://t.co/xEqqtwoC8R pic.twitter.com/t5kkngj8Xp— Reuters U.S. News (@ReutersUS) January 12, 2024      6.43am GMT   The UK’s services sector could help the country avoid falling into recession at the end of last year, suggets Michael Hewson of CMC Markets:  Today’s November numbers are unlikely to be anywhere near as poor [as October, when GDP fell 0.3%] and should see a modest rebound of 0.2%, with the index of services expected to drive the improvement with a strong rebound from their decline in October.  We already know from recent services PMI numbers that the UK economy appeared to rebound strongly in the final 2-months of 2023, which in turn could see the economy avoid a technical recession after the -0.1% contraction in Q3. November is also expected to see an improvement in industrial and manufacturing production of 0.3% after the sharp declines in October.      6.39am GMT   The UK economy “likely rebounded in November”, predicts Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist. He told clients this week:  Indeed, many of the factors driving the drop in output over October looked temporary. Survey data also pointed to a mild bounce back in activity. And our nowcast models point to a rebound in GDP. What do we expect? We expect a 0.2% month-on-month expansion in GDP. Services activity, we think, will have jumped by 0.2% m-o-m, with industrial production up 0.4% m-o-m, and construction output rising by 0.1% m-o-m. Risks to our projection are skewed to the upside.  However, Deutsche has also lowered its forecast for 2023 GDP growth to 0.3%. And it expects a “a bumpy start” to 2024, with strike activity dragging output in January.  Updated at 6.39am GMT    6.38am GMT  Introduction: UK GDP report in focus  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. New GDP data will show how the UK economy performed in November, as it flirts with a technical recession. Economists predict the economy returned to growth in November, with GDP expected to have risen by 0.2%. That would be a welcome pick-up, after GDP fell by 0.3% in October, and also shrank in July-September, which put Britain on the brink of a recession. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says:  We expect a modest rebound in activity that should allay fears of a Q4 recession.  But, the broader picture may be that the UK economy is stuck in neutral gear, wavering between stagnation and a minor contraction. Bloomberg says:  It’s a bleak backdrop for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to fight the next election, though there is some prospect of an improvement later this year.  We’ll get the figures at 7am.

        "content": "From the humble luggage tray to filters that mask smells at sewage plants, the sale of some of Britain’s most pedestrian assets to the world’s largest money manager is to bring a multimillion-dollar payday to a small clutch of little-known bankers. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which boasts a $100bn (£79bn) collection of companies including Gatwick airport and the Suez wastewater group, has been sold to the US investment firm BlackRock in a $12.5bn deal. The price tag puts each of GIP’sfounders and partners in line for a huge payday, nearly two decades after the New York-headquartered ports-to-pipes investor was formed. Five of the six founding partners, including the chief executive, Adebayo Ogunlesi, will join BlackRock as part of the deal. The takeover will make BlackRock the world’s second-largest infrastructure investor, behind Australia’s Macquarie group. GIP was devised by Ogunlesi, his fellow former Credit Suisse banker Matthew Harris and Bill Woodburn, a former General Electric infrastructure chief who they lured to join them over dinner in Manhattan. Ogunlesi, known as “Bayo”, was born in Nigeria and studied at Oxford and Harvard, before becoming the first non-American to serve as a law clerk in the US supreme court. From there he went on to become an influential dealmaker at Credit Suisse. In Europe, the business is led by Michael McGhee, another former Credit Suisse banker and founding partner who joined GIP at its inception. He leads its transport sector industry investment teams including deals for airports, ports and freight rail. GIP has also employed the former British prime minister Sir John Major as chair of its advisory board. The fund was started in 2006 with $500m each from General Electric and Credit Suisse, and grew quickly, snapping up crumbling assets in the energy, transport and water industries, before fixing them and selling them on. Now, it owns 40 companies generating more than $75bn in annual revenues, with a combined workforce of 115,000 people. In the UK, its portfolio includes Gatwick; a stake in Peel Ports, which owns seven ports, and Hornsea 1, the project to build the world’s largest offshore windfarm in the North Sea. GIP bought City airport for £760m in 2006, and sold the London hub to a Canadian-led consortium for £2bn in 2016. BlackRock hopes to capitalise on a global acceleration in government infrastructure spending. Politicians have attempted to support infrastructure spending to boost their domestic economies, notably on renewable energy initiatives, including Joe Biden’s $369bn Inflation Reduction Act. The chair and chief executive of BlackRock, Larry Fink, said: “Infrastructure is one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities, as a number of structural shifts reshape the global economy … Policymakers are only just beginning to implement once-in-a-generation financial incentives for new infrastructure technologies and projects.” BlackRock will pay $3bn in cash and 12m of its own shares as part of the deal to buy GIP. The 400 people directly employed by GIP will receive some of the stock. As well as the fund’s founders and partners, the takeover represents a payday for bankers and lawyers for BlackRock and GIP when it is completed, likely between July and September. Bankers from the US financial services firm Perella Weinberg Partners are working for BlackRock, while Evercore is advising GIP. Separately on Friday, BlackRock said its assets under management had topped $10tn for the first time since 2021. Its revenues rose 7% to $4.6bn in the final quarter of 2023."

        "content": "Starbucks, the coffee chain that has long portrayed itself as an ethical business and fair employer, is being sued by a US consumer group that claims its image is a deception that hides multiple instances of labor and human rights violations in the making of its products.   Related: Ebay fined $3m after workers harassed couple and sent spiders to their home   While the coffee giant has committed to “100% ethical” sourcing, the lawsuit claims it has instead misled the public by procuring materials from farms and cooperatives that have committed various violations against workers. “On every bag of coffee and box of K-cups sitting on grocery store shelves, Starbucks is telling consumers a lie,” said Sally Greenberg, chief executive officer of the National Consumers League, which has lodged the lawsuit in the superior court of the District of Columbia. “The facts are clear: there are significant human rights and labor abuses across Starbucks’ supply chain, and consumers have a right to know exactly what they’re paying for.” The legal complaint alleges that Starbucks has failed to reform its coffee- and tea-sourcing practices and has capitalized upon a “significant and growing consumer demand for ethically sourced goods and services”. Specific allegations in the lawsuit include claims that Starbucks’ biggest supplier in Brazil has overseen working conditions akin to slavery, including the illegal trafficking of migrant workers, while child labor has been allegedly used in separate Starbucks-certified farms in Guatemala. In Kenya, meanwhile, a plantation operation that supplies tea to Starbucks has been accused of “rampant sexual abuse”, including supervisors forcing women to have sex in return for work. Starbucks has long touted its ethical and sustainable reputation, writing in its Global Human Rights Statement that it picks suppliers that “conduct business in a responsible and ethical manner”. The company has strongly denied the claims laid out in the National Consumers League lawsuit. “Please know we take these allegations very seriously, and plan to aggressively defend against claims that Starbucks has misrepresented our ethical sourcing commitments to customers,” Michelle Burns, Starbucks’ executive vice-president of global coffee, social impact and sustainability, wrote in a public note to its partners. Burns said Starbucks’ sourcing practices are “best in class”. Starbucks said in a statement to the Guardian that it has taken corrective action in both Guatemala and Kenya.“We take allegations like these extremely seriously and are actively engaged with farms to ensure they adhere to our standards,” said a Starbucks spokesperson.“Each supply chain is required to undergo reverification regularly and we remain committed to working with our business partners to meet the expectations detailed in our Global Human Rights Statement.”"

        "content": "Oil prices have hit $80 (£62.83) as fears grew about the economic impact of disruption to international trade through the Red Sea and escalating tensions in the Middle East. Raising concerns about a possible inflation shock for the world economy, Brent crude prices jumped by about 4% to a high of $80.75 a barrel on Friday, while US West Texas Intermediate crude also increased after US and UK airstrikes against Houthi rebel sites in Yemen. The overnight strikes were in response to attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the missiles, drones and rockets fired by the Yemeni group at US and UK warships, as tensions mount in the region during the Israel-Gaza war. The world’s largest shipping lines have paused shipments through the Red Sea, diverting container freight around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa – adding thousands of miles to journeys, driving up costs and delaying deliveries of vital components and consumer goods to Europe. Economists warn that disruption to shipping and higher oil prices, if sustained, could undermine progress to continue bringing inflation back down from the highest levels in decades after the Covid pandemic and energy price-shock exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, said the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East had the potential to disrupt energy, food markets, migration and military and economic relationships. “These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. While we hope for the best, the past year demonstrated why we must be prepared for any environment,” he said. Ana Boata, the head of macroeconomic research at Allianz Trade, said the disruption could push inflation up by 0.7 percentage points in Europe and the US while sapping a similar amount from economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. “Should this crisis last for several months, global trade growth in volume would be impacted … increasing the risk of a delayed rebound from the 2023 recession,” she said. Sources close to the UK Treasury said it had modelled various scenarios for the potential impact on Britain, in details first reported by the BBC, including crude oil prices rising by more than $10 a barrel and a 25% increase in natural gas. Ministers are concerned that disruption to shipping could damage Britain’s economy as it struggles for growth momentum amid pressure on households and businesses from the cost of living crisis. Official figures on Friday showed the UK economy grew by 0.3% in November – after shrinking by 0.3% in October – propped up in part by Black Friday spending. Economists cautioned that figures published next month could show the UK slipped into recession at the end of 2023, despite growth in November. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has warned that the shipping disruption “may have an impact” and that the government is watching developments closely.  The rerouting of shipments from the Red Sea to around the coast of Africa adds about 10 days longer to journey times, adding to the cost of deliveries and causing delays for manufacturers and retailers in Europe. However, while shipping costs have almost tripled since late November, they remain only a quarter of the peak recorded in 2021, when the pandemic and blockage of the Suez canal by the Ever Given container ship caused chaos for international trade. Meanwhile, the global economy is in a weaker position amid faltering consumer demand, with households under pressure from elevated living costs and higher central bank interest rates. Although oil prices have risen sharply, they remain significantly lower than in the autumn of 2023, and almost $60 below near-record levels reached in March 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. John Glen, the chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said: “The global economy isn’t growing as fast, and the volumes of sea freight are down significantly from where they were 12 months ago. And the key issue is inflation is going to be driven by what’s in the box, rather than the cost of transporting it.” However, economists say sustained disruption or further escalation in the Middle East conflict could have a bigger impact. “The really scary thing would be in the Gulf of Oman and the strait of Hormuz, given its importance for oil and gas. That’d be a different kettle of fish altogether,” Glen said."

        "content": "Industrial action at the nation’s busiest ports will have a cascading impact on multiple industries and pose a significant threat to the economy, independent experts have warned. On Friday, the Fair Work Commission ruled that workers at Australia’s second largest port operator, DP World, could stop work at its Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle terminals. It’s the latest instance of industrial action since October. How badly will this hit the economy? It could be very significant, according to independent experts. Supply chains are complex and delays can lead to extra costs being passed along to a range of different industries with varying impacts. If you ask DP World, this dispute is costing more than $84m a week, with a backlog of 44,000 containers that could take two months to clear. Independent experts say that figure is difficult to verify but confirm there are significant delays.   Related: DP World hack: port operator gradually restarting operations around Australia after cyber-attack   Prof Lushen Shao, an expert in supply chains at the University of Melbourne, says: “The impact could be significant considering that the market share of DP World sits at around 37% and the dispute has lasted for months with an increasingly larger scale.” Dr Hadi Ghaderi, a logistics and supply chain expert at Swinburne University, says Australia is increasingly reliant on containerised trade and the consequence of delays may not be immediately apparent. “Even minor disruptions could lead to very, very lengthy disruptions,” Ghaderi says. “This started in October. It could definitely impact the overall health of the supply chain.” So are freight costs about to go up? They already have and, according to the peak body for the container transport industry, they’ll keep going up until the dispute is resolved. The Container Transport Alliance Australia’s advocate, Neil Chambers, has urged both parties to reach consensus as soon as possible, either by agreement or arbitration. “Purely from the land transport side of things, this is probably costing importers and exporters about 20% more in logistics costs, which is not an insignificant increase,” Chambers says.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The financial figure will depend on the value of the goods being shipped, he says. “Most of the transport operators have implemented congestion surcharges. They go to drop off exports or pick up imports and find out they can’t be serviced before work is stopped as part of industrial action. They can’t be expected to pick up the additional costs, so they’re passed on and there’s a natural flow-on effect.” Will this affect the price of consumer goods? Potentially yes, but it is difficult to say by how much and when. According to DP World, white goods and appliances such as televisions and radios are among the most imported items at affected ports, along with engines and machines. Coles, Woolworths, JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman are all reportedly affected. Shao says any impact on the price of consumer goods will not be immediately noticed by consumers and a spike isn’t guaranteed.   Related: Major multinational port operator paid zero tax in Australia while raking in billions   “The industrial disruption would inevitably increase the operational cost of shipping companies, but the cost increase would have to be passed on to businesses and then to consumers so that they can be felt by consumers,” Shao says. “If the impact is short-term and not significant, it is possible for businesses to absorb it.” Peter Van Duijn, a logistics expert at Deakin University who was a senior manager at shipping company Patrick during the waterfront dispute, says delays could be the biggest hit to retailers. “The additional cost on a container-load of televisions if probably not much per unit. But if you have commodities going to retail stores, they might miss sales targets as a result,” Van Duijn says. “If you import 30,000 T-shirts in a container, well there might be a $500 cost. But retailers might think, ‘Oh, this is a nice opportunity to increase prices.’” So what about our exports? This is what concerns most independent experts. While Australian retailers may be able to pass any additional costs on to consumers, exporters don’t always have that option. According to DP World, fresh meat is the most exported item at three of the impacted ports: Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle. At Botany in Sydney, it’s second. Ghaderi says the industrial action coincides with record high meat exports – up 23% on the past year. In October, more than 5,000 shipping containers of meat left the Port of Melbourne, where industrial action is taking place. “Such strong numbers depend on a resilient container supply chain and streamlined port operations,” Ghaderi says. Chambers says delays could reverberate back through the supply chain and impact farmers. “If you have delays when shipping things that need to be refrigerated – like meat or seafood – then you are paying more on energy costs to store them,” Chambers says. “You might be paying hundreds of extra dollars in power costs and you might not meet your export contract. That’s a really damaging issue for Australia. It impacts our long-term reputation as a supplier of fresh produce, grains and pulses.” Will the Red Sea operation further increase costs? On the same day DP World staff walked off the job, the US and UK militaries launched more than a dozen airstrikes against sites used by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. The Houthis’ drone and missile attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea were disrupting supply chains. The peak body for the shipping industry, Shipping Australia, says this will have an indirect impact on costs but not as much as it would have in previous decades. The bulk of Australia import and export trade is now within the Asian region. “Anything of this nature will produce upward cost pressure on freight rates. It already has and it is likely to continue doing so,” Shipping Australia’s policy manager, Jim Wilson, says. “Anything that causes such a massive deviation around Africa will inevitably induce delay and extra costs.” Hostilities often lead insurers to increase war-risk premiums. A small increase in premiums can have a big impact, depending on the value of goods that are being carried by the ships. Wilson says shipping will probably continue through the Red Sea despite the conflict. “Historically, international commercial shipping has continued sailing during a wide range of global crises – including armed conflicts – and we cannot see that will change.”"

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt knows there is little to celebrate from modest economic growth during November. The 0.3% increase in gross domestic product follows a drop of 0.3% in October, and the three-month figure – which is considered a more reliable and certainly less volatile measure of economic growth – showed a 0.2% contraction to the end of November. The services sector was moribund in the three months to November, while production output fell by 1.5% and construction fell by 0.6% over the same period. Simon French, the chief economist at the stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said the single-month figure showed there was “a decent chance” the UK had again avoided a recession. Sandra Horsfield, a UK economist at Investec, was less sure: “It remains touch-and-go whether the economy tipped into a technical recession in the second half of 2023.” Both were looking through a microscope at small percentage points either side of zero, making it clear that, for the economy and the chancellor, interest rate cuts by the Bank of England cannot come soon enough. Without lower borrowing costs, a period of zero growth stretching back more than a year is likely to continue well into 2024, and with an election less than a year away, that spells disaster for the Conservative administration. Hunt said he was content for growth to remain low while all efforts were made to bring down inflation. The chancellor said this with the belief the battle against rising prices was almost won after a flurry of revisions by City economists of inflationary trends. This re-examination of the influences on the consumer prices index revealed price growth will probably drop below the Bank of England’s 2% target in April, although prolonged disruption to shipping in the Red Sea will raise concerns about a fresh inflationary threat. Oil prices were up almost 4% on Friday, at just above $80 a barrel. Next month, when they meet in the Bank’s Threadneedle Street headquarters, members of the monetary policy committee are likely to agree that their previous forecasts were too pessimistic and some of the drivers of inflation were weaker than previously estimated. They will come under severe pressure to begin cutting interest rates from 5.25%, maybe as early as May, easing the financial burden on households and businesses. Hunt will also benefit because lower inflation and lower interest rates will cut his debt bills and give him more room to carry out the tax cuts his party craves. Households and businesses may crank up their spending in the second half of the year and give the economy a boost. Jonathan Hall, a member of the Bank of England’s financial policy committee, said in parliament last week that he was concerned the drop in inflation and possible cuts to interest rates would create a period of exuberance and a dangerously high level of borrowing. That might be a worry for the MPC and trigger a return of high interest rates, but that would be a problem for the next chancellor."

        "content": "Burberry has warned that annual profits will be sharply lower than previously expected after consumers left its expensive trenchcoats, bags and scarves off their Christmas shopping lists. The luxury British brand said trading had been affected by a continued slowdown in luxury demand after rises in the cost of living and increases to interest rates globally. Burberry is now expecting operating profits of between £410m and £460m in the year to the end of March. It previously said profits would be at the lower end of a £552m to £668m range. The company’s share price slumped 14% in early trading, before partly recovering to be down 6%, making it the top faller on the FTSE 100 on Friday. Shares are down almost 45% over the past year. Shoppers found the luxury brand’s premium priced products – such as its classic heritage trenchcoat at £1,890 and signature scarf at £420 – too expensive for household budgets drastically cut back amid the cost of living crisis. “We are continuing to deliver the transition to our new modern British luxury creative expression for Burberry which started appearing in our stores in early autumn,” said Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive of Burberry. “We are still in the early stages of executing on this, which has become more challenging against the backdrop of slowing luxury demand. We experienced a further deceleration in our key December trading period.” Revenues fell 7% to £706m year on year in the 13 weeks to 30 December. Burberry said sales at comparable stores – those open for more than a year – were down 4% year on year overall for the period, with Europe down 5% and the US down 15%, while Asia Pacific rose 3%. ”The cracks appearing in luxury demand are very telling,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “So-called aspirational shoppers are one of the demographics pulling back, and Burberry is more exposed to this type of customer than super-high-end luxury. The business model also lacks the product diversification that others in the space have.” Rivals including the French luxury brands LVMH and Kering have also reported lower demand for high-end goods in key markets such as the US, Europe and China as the post-pandemic spree wears off. Last month, National Debtline said that about 6.5 million people would struggle to heat their homes sufficiently over the festive season, while 2.7 million had to choose between buying food or presents, highlighting the drastic impact the cost of living crisis continues to have on household budgets. More than 14 million consumers planned to cut back on the number of presents they intended to buy, while 6 million decided that they could only afford to buy gifts for children this year. Burberry had been enjoying something of a rejuvenation of its fortunes, posting profits of £634m in the year to the end of March 2023, up significantly on the £523m in 2022."

        "content": "The UK economy returned to growth in November after a recovery in consumer spending driven by Black Friday sales, with shoppers hunting for bargains as the key Christmas shopping season got under way. Gross domestic product rose by 0.3% on the month, after a decline of 0.3% in October, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists had forecast more modest growth of 0.2%. Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said the bounceback was fuelled by the country’s dominant services sector, with retail, car leasing and video games companies all having a buoyant month.“The longer-term picture remains one of an economy that has shown little growth over the last year,” he said. Figures this week showed that some of Britain’s largest retailers recorded a bumper Christmas shopping season, helped by growth in online orders and high demand for festive food and drink, despite subdued demand for costlier items such as furniture and electrical goods. The ONS said services output grew by 0.3% in November, reversing a fall in October after strikes in the health service and education had hit activity. Production output – which includes manufacturing and energy generation – also returned to growth, while activity in the construction sector slumped by 0.2%. Over the broader three month-period to the end of November, GDP was estimated to have fallen by 0.2%, reflecting the pressure on households amid the cost of living crisis. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at the accountancy firm KPMG UK, said the overall outlook remained “gloomy”, while a technical recession remained a possibility for the second half of 2023. “Even if the economy manages to avoid a recession, it is expected to remain in stagnation territory,” she said. The latest figures come amid growing expectations the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year as inflation continues to fall back from the highest level in four decades. Official figures due next week are expected to show inflation cooled in November from 3.9% in October, although households remain under significant pressure as prices remain high. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said it was welcome news that growth returned in November but cautioned that it would remain slow while inflation continued to fall back. “We have seen that advanced economies with lower taxes have grown more rapidly, so our tax cuts for businesses and workers put the UK in a strong position for growth into the future,” he said."

        "content": "Marks & Spencer has hailed its “best ever Christmas” as customers flocked back for cheaper than expected everyday food items – and reliably affordable clothing – as the company made a concerted push for a bigger share of the weekly grocery shop. Under boss Stuart Machin the group has been opening larger stores, cutting prices on household basics and even offering bigger packs in order to persuade shoppers to do more than pick up a sandwich for lunch or a ready meal for dinner. The retailer’s efforts to broaden its appeal appear to be paying off as the number of bigger food baskets worth over £30 going through the tills were up 15% over the quarter, driven by the larger food halls it has recently created through refurbishments or new openings.  Interactive  M&S edged closer to Waitrose as it took a 3.4% share of the grocery market in the 12 weeks to 2 December according to research firm NielsenIQ (NIQ), up from 3.3% a year before. The upmarket chain is unlikely to ever be Tesco or Sainsbury’s – which hold shares of about 26% and 14% respectively – but Waitrose on just 3.6% is in its sights. On Thursday, Machin said the company had taken a £60m hit on profit margins to keep prices competitive and win over shoppers. Sales of the M&S budget Remarksable range – which includes key items such as butter, milk and bread priced at prices on a par with the mainstream chains – were up 18% over the Christmas period while shoppers popping in for some basics also spent 10% more on M&S’s top of the range products. “Our food business is becoming a different food business and that is not just for Christmas,” said Machin. “Five years ago we had only a handful of stores that were doing £1m in Christmas week now we’ve got 20-plus doing a lot more than that.” Clever marketing and judicious pricing on everyday items has seen M&S become an unlikely star on social media channel TikTok where it’s not hard to find influencers – from mums to students – talking about the bargains that can be found. Better availability and lower costs, helped by the acquisition of M&S’s long-term food distribution partner Gist in 2020, have helped underpin the performance. A tie-up with online retailer Ocado, where M&S became co-owner and the main grocery partner in September 2020, is another potentially overlooked part of the strategy. The joint venture – which reports separate financial results – remains unprofitable, but it does come with other benefits. M&S now has 90% of its products available on the site, bringing additional scale and therefore driving better deals with suppliers. It also appeals to younger shoppers who might not have ventured into a high street store, a shift that tallies with M&S’s efforts in fashion which have also improved appeal to millennial women. No doubt information about what sold well for Ocado’s former business partner – Waitrose – has also been useful to M&S, which had to put together numerous versions of the upmarket grocer’s bestsellers to keep Ocado shoppers on side after the switch. Shifts into newer categories such as frozen foods have also been made more viable by the presence of Ocado’s army of family shoppers. Machin said it was not just gunning for one competitor, but Waitrose will need to up its game to avoid being trounced by its long-term rival."

        "content": "It’s off to the moon for bitcoin’s price, then? That, at least, was the tone of advance opinion among the crypto crew if the US financial regulator approved the creation of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track the value of the cryptocurrency. Now the Securities and Exchange Commission, grudgingly and with a heavy warning that it is not endorsing bitcoin itself, has given a thumbs up. Cue a fresh whoosh of demand, we are told, from US institutions and private punters who will be able to hitch themselves to the bitcoin wagon without having to go to the bother of opening a digital wallet or dealing with a crypto trading platform. The word “watershed” has been used widely to describe the moment. Giant investment names such as BlackRock will be offering these new ETFs. Ease of access and mainstream respectability have arrived as a package. The thesis of a boom in demand, and thus substantially higher prices, is plausible – if only because the history of bitcoin for the past eight years has involved the price either soaring or plunging. The cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value and, as a means of exchange, its volatility makes it next-to-useless unless you’re a fraudster or criminal, but there’s no accounting for people’s appetite to speculate. As with casinos and slot machines, people will tend to use them if you make it easy for them to do so. But the off-to-the-moon idea also feels a little simplistic at this point. First, confidence that the SEC would approve ETFs has been high and rising for months. Indeed, in the never-ending search for explanations for bitcoin’s price movements, the likelihood of a green light from the SEC has been offered as a reason for the rise from $17,000 (£13,370) at Christmas 2022 to the current $47,000-ish. To some degree, the hype value from SEC approval must already be exhausted. Second, a new set of investors actually has to turn up in large numbers to satisfy expectations. And some forecasts for the wave of new money are enormous. Standard Chartered analysts this week said the ETFs could attract $50bn to $100bn this year, which they reckoned would take the price of bitcoin as high as $100,000. Anything can happen, but even the lower end of that range for predicted flow of cash could not possibly be met by retail speculators alone. Are institutional firms really itching to make allocations to an instrument that can double or halve in value in the space of six months for no clear reason? Perhaps they are, but there are plenty of other ways to inject risk into a portfolio. There is still (let’s hope) a degree of career-risk to professional money managers in being caught on the wrong side of a crypto price plunge. On day one of trading of the new ETFs, the volume of trading in bitcoin did indeed increase and volatility in the price was up to usual standards (almost $49,000 one minute, then $46,000 within the hour). Come back in a few months to discover if the launch of ETFs really marked a new era. But, for the hype merchants, there must be a danger of it being better to travel than arrive. In the real world of everyday transactions for goods and services, bitcoin is irrelevant – still."

        "content": "Global trade fell in December as Houthi attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea disrupted operations. The boss of the world’s biggest shipping line has said it could take months before the trade route is safe to traverse. Global trade dropped by 1.3% in December, with a significant fall in shipments in the Red Sea driving that fall, according to figures from IfW Kiel. A report by the German economic institute found that the number of containers travelling daily through the Red Sea fell by 60% from 500,000 in November to 200,000 last month. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched 25 attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea since November, forcing shipping lines to suspend passage through the key trade route and reroute elsewhere. On Thursday, the Iranian navy confirmed it had seized an oil tanker associated with a Greek shipping company in the Gulf of Oman, prompting fears the disruption could escalate and spread to the Gulf. Separately, Vincent Clerc, the chief executive of the global shipping company Maersk, said the Red Sea disruption could last for months. He said the attacks by Houthi militants were “brutal and dramatic” and could lead to further inflation across the global economy. He told the Financial Times: “It’s unclear to us if we are talking about re-establishing safe passage into the Red Sea in a matter of days, weeks or months …  It could potentially have quite significant consequences on global growth.” Last week, Maersk, which is responsible for moving 20% of global trade each year, decided to divert all of its ships around the southern tip of Africa after two of its vessels were attacked in December. Clerc said: “At this time when inflation is a big issue, it’s putting inflationary pressure on our costs, on our customers, and ultimately on consumers in Europe and the US. In the short run, it could cause significant disruptions at the end of January, February and into March.” According to IfW Kiel’s report, titled “Cargo volume in the Red Sea collapses”, the EU was the worst hit in December, with exports dropping by 2% and imports falling by 3.1%. The US had imports drop by 1.5% and exports fall by 1%. Retailers have said problems in the Red Sea could lead to inflation and some availability issues if container ships kept having to divert around Africa. They said longer journey times would add some costs, but that overall freight costs would rise if more vessels were caught up in delays, reducing the amount of available global shipping capacity. Stuart Machin, the chief executive of Marks & Spencer, said availability of some items – mainly clothing – may be affected in February and March, and alcohol deliveries could also be affected. However, Machin suggested M&S was likely to be able to absorb the increased costs unless the problems ground on for months. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, said the problems meant clothing prices were likely to remain steady, when he had hoped they would drop this spring. Tesco said the problems in the Red Sea might lead to more inflation as extended shipping times would diminish capacity in the system and drive up prices."

        "content": "The former UK boss of Fujitsu, the technology firm whose flawed IT system is at the heart of the Post Office Horizon scandal, received a £2.6m payoff after standing down from the company in 2019, corporate filings suggest. Fujitsu has come under increasing scrutiny during the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal, which led to thousands of people who owned and ran smaller post offices being falsely accused or convicted of theft or fraud between 1999 and 2015. Amid growing anger at the widespread miscarriage of justice, campaigners and politicians, including the justice minister, Alex Chalk, have suggested that Fujitsu should face financial consequences for its role in designing the Horizon system. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that the company’s UK arm had paid out millions in salaries and share bonuses to directors last year, after reporting £22m in profits thanks in part to major government contracts. New analysis of corporate filings suggests that Fujitsu also made a £2.6m farewell payment to the head of its UK & Ireland division in 2020. The payment was made even as Fujitsu’s failings emerged during successive court cases brought by former post office operators seeking to clear their names. Accounts for the technology company’s UK and Ireland division, Fujitsu Services Limited, show that one director received £2.6m “compensation for loss of office” in the year to the end of March 2020, after their resignation. The disclosure is understood to refer to Duncan Tait, who joined Fujitsu in 2009 and rose to become the first non-Japanese person to sit on the Tokyo-based group’s board. Tait ran the company’s UK & Ireland business between 2011 and 2014 before being promoted to oversee Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas regions. He resigned from Fujitsu in July 2019 and is understood to be the director referred to in the accounts for 2020, a year in which the business doubled its pre-tax profit to £32.7m. Filings from the previous year show that the company’s highest-paid director, likely to have been Tait, was paid an annual salary of £2.5m. Fujitsu declined to comment on the terms of the payment or say why Tait had left the company. Less than a year after leaving Fujitsu, he was appointed chief executive of the car dealership business Inchcape, whose annual report lists his remuneration for 2022 as £4m, after a £3.2m bonus. When contacted by the Guardian, Tait said: “I am appalled by the harsh treatment of the subpostmasters and fully support the public inquiry. It would be inappropriate for me to comment ahead of this.” He declined to comment on the terms of the payment he received upon leaving Fujitsu. Tait’s successor, Paul Patterson, is due to give evidence to the Horizon inquiry on 19 January. However, Tait has not been called to give evidence. Fujitsu’s UK arm has continued to report sizeable profits, due in part to the ongoing award of major government contracts, including for the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. The UK division posted of profits of £22m last year, the Guardian revealed earlier this week. It also paid out millions in salary and bonuses to directors. Its three directors shared pay of £2.3m, of which £1.3m was paid to one unnamed executive. Separate accounts for Fujitsu’s European holding company, which also includes operations in Scandinavia and the Middle East, indicate that its directors were also paid bonuses. Two directors of Fujitsu Services Holdings plc received share-based payouts as part of a “long-term incentive scheme”, a form of bonus that rewards executives for performance, typically over several years."

        "published_date": "2024-01-11T16:46:30+00:00",
        "content": "Thames Water is bypassing local democracy to attempt to push through a controversial water recycling project that campaigners say threatens to increase pollution in the river. Steve Barclay, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, has agreed to an application by the water company to consider its Teddington water recycling scheme under national infrastructure rules. The decision means local authorities will be bypassed, and the secretary of state will make the decision whether to grant a development consent order. The company applied for the project to be considered under national infrastructure rules as it faced a public backlash over the scheme, which is being promoted as a solution to tackling climate crisis-induced droughts. The £250m project involves using effluent from sewage treatment works, putting it through a further layer of treatment and releasing the treated water into a river, in order to replace the same amount of water that is abstracted off for drinking water. Thames Water’s scheme would involve abstracting 75m litres of water a day from the River Thames at Teddington, south-west London, in times of drought, and replacing it with treated sewage from the nearby Mogden sewage treatment works through a new tunnel. Environmental campaigners have raised a number of concerns, such as damage to river systems from the increased water temperatures caused by pumping treated sewage into the river during low flow, a change in the salinity of the river, and the impact on fish and biodiversity. There are concerns over the effect on river quality from so-called forever chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), potentially contained in the treated effluent. Pollution from raw and treated sewage and agricultural runoff are significant causes of the dire state of rivers in England. A similar scheme was rejected by the Environment Agency in 2019 because of the anticipated unacceptable impact on the environment of releasing millions of litres of treated effluent into the river.   Related: Conservative ‘failures’ have led to more sewage pollution, say water experts   Save our Lands and River, a group campaigning against the project, said Thames Water held four community events last year promising to take into account local feelings and evidence regarding environmental damage to the river and a protected nature reserve that would be dug up to build the tunnel for the project. But at the same time, the company was applying to the secretary of state under section 35 of the 2008 Planning Act to get the scheme appointed as a nationally significant infrastructure project and bypass local democracy, the campaigners said. “Thames Water is proposing several schemes that would collectively provide up to 13% of the additional water needed by 2040,” the group said. “Teddington is only one of these … therefore how can it be described as ‘nationally significant’? It begs the question: how much examination did Defra officials undertake of Thames Water’s application?” Thames Water is at the centre of a criminal investigation by the Environment Agency into the suspected illegal dumping of raw sewage from treatment works. The company leaks about 630m litres a day from its pipes, 60% of which are cast iron and have not been upgraded since the 19th century, according to the company’s latest business plan. The company has the oldest infrastructure assets of all the privatised water industry. Water recycling is likely to provide just a small portion – about 7% – of the new water needed in England by 2050, which is equivalent to the demand of a population of 9 million people. Critics say reducing public demand for water is required, with a major public education campaign. A Defra spokesperson said: “The Teddington direct river abstraction has been designated as a nationally significant infrastructure project, streamlining the development consent process. This designation does not indicate that the project is more or less likely to be granted development consent. Defra is currently reviewing Thames Water’s draft water resource management plan, which includes proposals for this project.” A Thames Water spokesperson said: “The development consent order is an open and transparent process, managed at the national level, which will fully engage local customers, communities and councils, enabling them to have their say … With London’s population forecast to grow to 12 million by 2050 and the UK set to experience more extreme heat events, we believe the Teddington direct river abstraction project is of national significance, as it will help us meet future water demand during drought and ensure we keep the taps flowing for our customers.”"

        "content": "Millions of drivers could be in line for a payout, it has been claimed, after the UK financial watchdog opened an investigation into whether consumers had been unfairly charged inflated prices for loans on new and secondhand cars. The Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday that it had decided to examine whether a compensation scheme was needed to deal with alleged large-scale mis-selling in the £50bn-a-year motor finance sector. Martin Lewis, a consumer champion, said the move could lead to “the new PPI” – a reference to the multibillion-pound payment protection insurance scandal.   Related: Car finance: what is the FCA looking into and will people get money back?   High street banks such as Lloyds Banking Group, Santander and Barclays are – or have been – big players in the UK motor finance market. As with the PPI debacle, any finding of widespread mis-selling could result in car finance sellers facing big bills for compensating customers. In recent years 80% to 90% of new cars and an increasing number of used vehicles have been bought with finance agreements, which include personal contract purchase (PCP) plans and hire purchase. Many involve the customer paying a deposit and a monthly fee, with interest, before later deciding whether to buy the car or swap to a different vehicle. But complaints from consumers have surged after the FCA clamped down on the way car dealers and brokers earn commission on sales. In January 2021, the regulator banned agreements where firms were able to receive commission linked to the interest rate that customers paid, because it gave brokers and dealers an incentive to increase people’s costs. The FCA said that there had been a “high number” of complaints from people who took out car finance prior to the ban who believed they were being charged too much, and added that most of these had been rejected by companies. However, the Financial Ombudsman Service recently ruled in favour of complainants in two cases, while some consumers have won county court cases, so the FCA said it was using its powers to investigate. “If we find there has been widespread misconduct and that consumers have lost out, we will identify how best to make sure people who are owed compensation receive an appropriate settlement in an orderly, consistent and efficient way,” the regulator said. Both of the ombudsman rulings state that the divisions of UK banks involved “did not act fairly and reasonably” in their dealings with the customer. One of the rulings required Black Horse, part of Lloyds Banking Group, to pay compensation to “Mrs Y”, who took out a hire purchase agreement to buy a used car in 2016. Mrs Y paid 5.5% interest, but the agreement could have been set up with a 2.49% rate, said the ombudsman. The other ruling requires Barclays Partner Finance – part of the Barclays group – to pay compensation to “Miss L”, who took out a conditional sale agreement (similar to hire purchase) to buy a used car in 2018. Miss L paid 4.67% interest, but the the agreement could have been set up with a rate of 2.68%. Black Horse, Santander and a specialist, MotoNovo, reportedly account for 57% of the UK’s car finance sector. It is understood that the vast majority of the complaints to the ombudsman have been submitted on people’s behalf by claims management firms and law firms, which typically take a cut of any compensation offered if the claim succeeds. The FCA announcement could trigger a renewed PPI-style campaign in which claims firms target people who may have been mis-sold products. Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the FCA announcement “may mean a payout for millions who bought a car/van on motor finance before 2021”. He estimated that compensation could read a “PPI-type scale” of £40bn.  Lewis predicted that the FCA would ultimately either set up a compensation scheme where it ordered all companies to pay redress to every affected customer, even if they had not complained, or publish rules under which companies must pay out redress based on a set formula to those who complained. The Finance & Leasing Association, a trade body for the motor finance sector, said it welcomed the announcement, adding: “We will work with the FCA over the coming months to resolve this issue.” However, it also said that “speculative and unfounded complaints issued by claims management companies have congested what should be a smooth, prompt and clear process”."

        "content": "What do you call an Italian restaurant that doesn’t serve pizza? During the 2022 Edinburgh fringe, Gusto’s restaurant in the city sounded like the punchline to one of the comedy festival’s jokes. Pizza wasn’t on the menu at the Italian restaurant because it had no maestro to wield the pala, the long-handled tray used to ferry the dough in and out of the kitchen’s searing-hot oven. “The fringe is our busiest month in Edinburgh but we had to close two days a week and couldn’t sell pizza,” says Gusto’s chief executive, Matt Snell. “Pizza chef is a skilled job and we could not find one. Our sales were a third of what they would normally have been.” Closures linked to staff shortages cost the business £750,000 that year. Salvation – the “gamechanger”, according to Snell – arrived when he realised that the 14-strong restaurant chain could tap into the government’s skilled-worker visa scheme. On the proviso that Gusto could show recruiting domestically was impossible, the company could pay the government £3,000 a time for a licence to hire chefs from overseas on a temporary visa. Bravissimo, staff shortage solved. “In the last 18 months we have recruited 30 chefs and have spent over £200,000 on this project,” says Snell. “It has been the difference between keeping restaurants open or closed.” That lifeline – and the pizza – is now under threat from a Conservative government policy that many in hospitality feel prioritises political calculation over economic realism. Under plans to cut migration by 300,000 a year, the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa will increase from £26,200 to £38,700 from April. The same salary threshold will apply to anyone, including British citizens, who wants to bring family members to the UK, although this has been delayed to 2025 after a government U-turn prompted by widespread dismay. These policy changes could have a chilling effect on an industry still reeling from Covid, rampant inflation and the resulting cost of living crisis, businesses fear. What’s more, the government made its decision, according to the trade body UK Hospitality, without any consultation with the industry. The organisation, which represents firms running 100,000 hospitality venues, has written to the Home Office laying out some of its concerns. These include the fact that 95% of the 8,500 migrant workers recruited last year would be ineligible for a visa under the new thresholds.   Related: Short-staffed sectors in UK respond to measures to cut net migration   With migrants accounting for about 15% of the sector’s workforce, shutting them out altogether would only intensify the frenzied battle to find staff. The job vacancy rate in the sector is already high at 8% – about 120,000 roles unfilled – and the shortfall rises to as much as 10% for head chefs and 21% for production chefs, the worker bees who keep dishes flowing in high-volume kitchens and factories. In areas such as Cumbria, sparsely populated but with a high tourist count, shortages are even more acute. Businesses in the Lake District are “frustrated and angry” with the government’s plans, according to Gillian Haigh, managing director of Cumbria Tourism. “It’s come out of the blue that they would think increasing the salary threshold could do anything other than heighten the extreme labour supply crisis,” she says. “What are businesses meant to do? Some are saying there are parts of their business they won’t be able to run, or they can’t run it at all.” Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, highlights the risk not just of losing out on the regular flow of staff into Britain’s hotels, restaurants and bars but the extra competition with other sectors facing the same problem. “There’s an economy-wide shortage of labour. They [migrant workers] are a vital and important component and crucially they are plugging a gap.” In theory, the result could be that hospitality businesses are incentivised to pay higher wages, which would then be earned by domestically sourced employees. But the reality is that even when wages rise, the supply of skilled staff simply isn’t there. Nicholls points to a demographic “timebomb” that struck in 2020, when slower birth rates from the years around the millennium led to a drop in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds coming into the workforce. Covid shut down the talent pipeline coming through catering colleges, or led to staff taking jobs elsewhere when pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels closed their doors. “Amazon warehouses took a lot of our staff during lockdown,” says Snell. “They could walk straight into it and it was paying similar levels. People didn’t come back to the industry.” So painful was the recruitment headache that when he advertised for a head chef in Birmingham, on a very competitive rate of £37,000, he woke up the next morning to find rival restaurants outbidding him for the same staff at £40,000. The economics simply didn’t make sense in an industry where margins are already wafer-thin.  There’s a threshold at which it becomes impossible to make money, so you have to put prices up, which drives inflation, which flies in the face of what the government say they’re trying to do,” says Snell.  Even if he could pay more, Snell isn’t confident that he would find the skilled workers needed. The government’s new migration policy will only exacerbate the problem, he says, leading to rising restaurant closures and a fall-off in VAT receipts paid to the exchequer. “The Tories have got themselves so wrapped up in this ‘stop the boats’ thing, that immigration is everything, that they’ve decided to clamp down without really understanding the effect it will have on different industries,” he says. “This is just another nail in the coffin of the hospitality industry.” It isn’t just businesses that could suffer, of course, but people, and the people who love them. Maria and her husband, Nasir, whose names have been changed to protect their identity, secured their first spouse visa last year, at a cost of nearly £5,000, not including English tests and document translation. “We have settled in rented accommodation and both have jobs. We have only ever put money into the UK,” says Maria. “It is devastating to find that although combining income we may just scrape past the new income requirement. “The ruling effectively prohibits us from starting a family. I am self-employed and if I became pregnant and had to take time off work, we would fall below the threshold and my husband could be kicked out. “I would have to choose between living as a single parent in the UK and taking my child away from their father, or leaving everything I’ve worked for here to join my husband in another country.” Asked about the potential impact of the changes on the hospitality sector, a Home Office spokesperson referred the Guardian to an online factsheet."

Ian Dodd, 55, who was Goldman’s global head of recruiting in London between 2018-2021, says in a personal injury claim at the high court that he developed a major depressive disorder and heart issues as a result of the workload placed on him by the US bank. Lawyers for Dodd said in documents filed at the the high court made public this week, according to Bloomberg\":  “His onerous workload and the associated stress and uncertainty that he faced when working unreasonable and excessive hours, together with the failure of the defendant’s senior leadership partners to provide him with adequate support, culminated in him wanting to take his own life.”   More here:   Related: Former recruitment head sues Goldman Sachs for £1m over ‘excessive workload’       3.13pm GMT  Microsoft overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company  Microsoft has overtaken Apple to become the world’s most valuable listed company today.

The headline consumer price index increased at an annual pace of 3.4% in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 3.1% in the previous month, and exceeding economists’ expectations of about 3.2%. On a month-to-month basis, the index climbed 0.3%, from 0.1% in November. Housing costs drove the index higher, and were responsible for more than half the headline increase. But there were some signs that inflation continued to soften in December. The so-called “core” consumer price index – a measure that does not include volatile food and energy prices – slowed to an annual rate 3.9%, from 4% the previous month. More here.

Ashworth explains that these moves will probably unwind soon:  Core prices only increased by 0.3% because of a 0.5% m/m increase in used vehicle prices, which we know from the more timely auction data will be more than reversed soon, and a bigger 0.5% m/m increase in shelter inflation, which we know isn’t going to last based on the marked slowdown in the more timely measures of newly-signed rental agreements.      2.05pm GMT   Analyst Andreas Steno Larsen argues that today’s US inflation report is “HOT”, as consumer prices rose faster than expected – by 0.3% in December alone, and 3.4% over the year.

Garland explains:  “Although we have seen a tick up in inflation in December, the big picture is US inflation is on a downward trend and that prices in the service sectors are beginning to contribute as wage growth moderates. Goods prices should start to stabilise by the summer meaning the path to 2% headline inflation won’t be a straight line. This will still provide sufficient cover for the Fed to cut rates, but the real question is - have market expectations for rate cuts in 2024 gone too far? Cuts totalling nearly 1.5% could be a stretch.”      1.45pm GMT   Snap reaction to the rise in US inflation is coming in. Here’s Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK:  “Today’s figures show an increase in the rate of inflation – a change that will likely be interpreted by the market as unwelcome, but unsurprising. Recent higher than expected earnings growth set alarm bells ringing for many investors who are hoping for interest rate cuts. While strong activity in the jobs market is a sign of a healthy economy and is good for workers, it can also be a contributing factor to inflation, so this likely played into the price rises we have seen today. “Inflation figures in recent months have been promising and a single number is not a trend, but if today’s report is the start of an upward pattern, there is a good chance that the Fed will delay rate cuts until later than previously expected. It looks like the market may have jumped the gun in pencilling in as many as six Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024.”      1.44pm GMT    JUST IN: Inflation was 3.4% for the full year of 2023.

This will cause disruption on the Suez Canal, a vital trading route. Roughly 20% of world’s container shipments pass through the Suez Canal, and the current disruption is likely to impact refrigerated goods, Saudi Arabia and the automotive industry the most. Our experts believe freight rates could spike to $4,000-$6,000 per container from $1,500, although unlikely to reach the 2021 peak levels of USD 15,000. Ripple effects such as the US port congestion (particularly on the east coast), Panama Canal bottlenecks and rate hikes on unrelated routes show no trade is isolated from the Red Sea disruption.

Reuters says:  The security firm Ambrey said the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker’s AIS tracking system was turned off as it headed in the direction of the Iranian port of Bandar e-Jask at the time it made the report. The ship, which loaded in the Iraqi port of Basra, and was heading to Aliaga in western Turkey, tracking data from LSEG showed. While Ambrey did not name the vessel, shipping tracking service TankerTrackers said the vessel was the St Nikolas, which in 2023 had been seized by the United States in a sanctions enforcement operation under a different name, Suez Rajan.  Reuters adds:  UKMTO said earlier on Thursday it had received a report that a vessel located around 50 nautical miles east of Oman’s coast was boarded by four to five armed persons. The armed intruders were reported to be wearing military style black uniforms and black masks.   Updated at 1.26pm GMT    10.47am GMT  Petrol pump price falls to lowest since October 2021  Despite the disruption to supplies in the Red Sea, the petrol price has hit the lowest level in over two years. According to the AA, the average pump price of petrol has fallen below 140p a litre for the first time since mid October 2021. Yesterday, it averaged 139.97p a litre across the UK, the AA say, the cheapest since 13 October 2021 when it averaged 139.55p. Petrol is now more than 50p per litre cheaper than in July 2022, when it hit a record high of 191.53p.  This means it now costs £77 to fill up the average 55-litre tank, down from £105 at the peak. Diesel prices have dropped to the lowest since early August, at an average of 147.83p. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s spokesman on pump prices, says:   “While the dramatic improvement in pump prices gives big savings to families and businesses, and also redirects millions of pounds from fuel sales potentially back to the high street, pump prices remain historically very high. Before covid and the Ukraine war, the worst drivers faced was 142.48p record set in April 2012.” “The danger is that current pump-price levels are baked in as the new normal.”      10.41am GMT  Bank of England fines former CEO of Wyelands Bank  The Bank of England has fined the former chief executive of Sanjeev Gupta-linked Wyelands Bank nearly £119,000 for breaching three conduct rules. The Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority has fined Iain Mark Hunter £118,808 for breaching three PRA Conduct Rules between 7 March 2016 and 28 May 2020.  The PRA says:  Mr Hunter failed both to act with due skill, care and diligence, and to take reasonable steps to ensure that Wyelands had adequate systems and controls in relation to the large exposures regime and PRA record keeping requirements.  This follows the public reprimand issued to Wyelands Bank by the Bank of England last April, after it discovered “wide-ranging significant regulatory failings” at the lender. The BoE has previously warned that Wyelands had made too many loans and complex financial agreements with companies linked to its owner, Gupta Family Group Alliance (GFG). Today, the PRA says Hunter failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that Wyelands:  had adequate systems and controls to identify, assess and manage connected parties’ risks in relation to large exposures; submitted large exposures returns which properly aggregated its exposures in respect of certain transactions with connected parties; had a formal and appropriate document retention policy in accordance with the record keeping obligations set out in the PRA Rulebook; and clearly apportioned responsibility for conducting analysis of Wyelands’ connected parties before March 2019.  Wyelands is owned by steel magnate Gupta, boss of the troubled Liberty Steel which was accused of “financial engineering” in 2021. In May 2021, the Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into the financing of GFG Alliance, which was dragged into a crisis after the collapse of Greensill Capital that year.

If so, that could risk creating an economic and inflationary hit to the global economy, companies, and consumers. Vincent Clerc, Maersk’s chief executive, told the FT Times that the closure of the Red Sea to most shipping after a series of attacks was “brutal and dramatic”. There are “no winners”, Clerc said, as vessels are forced to take a lengthy and costly detour around South Africa instead. Clerc added:  “It’s unclear to us if we are talking about re-establishing safe passage into [the] Red Sea in a matter of days, weeks or months . . . It could potentially have quite significant consequences on global growth.”  More here.  AP Møller-Maersk chief warns Red Sea shipping disruption may last for months https://t.co/bCVrZYwLJP— Financial Times (@FT) January 11, 2024      9.56am GMT   The Kiel Institute are optimistic, though, that the tumble in Red Sea cargo volumes will only have a small impact on consumers. And if shipping firms quickly adjust, negative outcomes could be avoided. Kiel point out that while shipping costs from China to Northern Europe have risen (to >$4,000 per container, up from $1,5000) they are still below pandemic levels (when it hit $14,000). Kiel’s Julian Hinz adds:  “Accordingly, despite a noticeable increase in transportation costs, no noticeable consequences for consumer prices in Europe are to be expected, especially as the proportion of freight costs in the value of goods for high-priced items, such as consumer electronics, is only in the per mille range [ie, parts per thousand]. “The situation today is not comparable to the environment during the Evergiven accident in the Suez Canal and the coronavirus pandemic, when lockdowns led to a drastic reduction in the supply of goods and demand in Europe exploded at the same time. Apart from slightly longer delivery times for products from the Far East and increased freight costs, to which the container ship network should quickly adjust, no negative consequences for global trade are to be expected.”      9.48am GMT  Global trade drops 1.3% as Red Sea attacks disrupt shipping  Global trade dropped by 1.3% in December as the Houthi attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea disrupted operations, new data shows. IfW Kiel, the German economic institute, has reported that the volume of containers transported in the Red Sea has plummeted by more than half and is currently almost 70 percent below the usual volume. According to Kiel, shipments in the Red Sea have fallen to around 200,000 containers per day, down from around 500,000 containers in November. Instead of sailing through the Red Sea, ships are now sailing around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, a detour that takes 7 to 20 days.  The longer journey time has significantly increased freight rates, with the transport of a 40-foot standard container between China and Northern Europe currently costing over $4,000, up from around $1,500 in November, Kiel says. Kiel explains:  As a result, freight costs and transportation time in goods traffic between East Asia and Europe have risen and imports and exports from Germany and the EU are in some cases significantly lower than in the previous month of November 2023.  Keil reports that imports into the European Union fell by 3.1% in December, with exports 2% lower. Julian Hinz, director of the Kiel Institute’s Trade Policy Research Center, says:  “The detour of ships due to the attacks in the Red Sea around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa means that the time it takes to transport goods between Asian production centers and European consumers is significantly extended by up to 20 days. This is also reflected in the declining trade figures for Germany and the EU, as transported goods are now still at sea and have not already been unloaded in the ports as planned.”  Kiel’s report, titled Cargo volume in the Red Sea collapses, is online here.

A Panorama investigation found the company removed the original labels on T-shirts and hoodies at the retailer’s controversial factory at Thurmaston Lane in Leicester between January and October last year. A spokesperson from Boohoo told the BBC the mislabelling was an “isolated incident” and a result of “human error”, adding:  “We have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again.”  Boohoo is considering closing its Leicester factory and relocating operations, as reported on Tuesday.

Murphy predicted that the UK will enjoy a period of relative stability for as long as unemployment is low. He also only expects a minimal impact to business from the disruption to shipments through the Red Sea. Murphy told reporters:  “Having to go around Africa to get to Europe extends shipping times, constrains shipping space and moves up shipping costs. “It could inflate the cost of some items but we just don’t know at the minute and don’t know how long the situation will last.”   Updated at 1.09pm GMT    8.39am GMT   More than 9,200 M&S shop workers are set to get bumper payouts under a share scheme.

Shares in M&S have dropped by 4.5% at the start of trading in London, to a three-week low. They are the worst performer on the FTSE 100, despite many analysts hailing its Christmas trading figures. There may be some disappointment that M&S hasn’t upgraded its profit outlook this morning. Investors will also have noted its warning about rising costs…. Also, M&S shares have had a good run; they doubled in value in 2023.  Updated at 8.31am GMT    8.06am GMT   Tesco’s Clubcard sales penetration and its low-price guarantee helped to drive sales despite pressures from the cost-of-living crisis, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor. She adds:  Its Aldi Price Match scheme and continued price cuts mean that customers know they are getting the cheapest prices in Tesco, helping to continue to attract shoppers to its stores. Tesco’s finest range also helped to drive sales over the festive season with a record Christmas sales week. On inflation, Tesco said it is inflating less than all key competitors, claiming to be the cheapest full-line grocer for over 14 months. Shares in Tesco have gained more than 20% over the past 12 months.”      8.02am GMT   By upgrading its profit forecast this morning, Tesco has gone one better than rival Sainsbury which could only maintain its outlook yesterday morning. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  “Tesco has managed what Sainsburys couldn’t quite muster, which is a profit upgrade for the full year. The tills were chiming away over Christmas, and the slightly conservative previous estimates, coupled with lower exposure to General Merchandise, means there’s room for expectations to be inflated. Investors will be especially pleased to hear of the £2bn in retail free cash flow due to pump round the business this year, helping to underpin the group’s ability to invest in staying competitive, and helping sustain the not insubstantial prospective dividend yield.      7.53am GMT  M&S beats forecasts: What the experts say  City analysts are lauding Marks & Spencer’s performance over Christmas, after it reported an 8.1% increase in like-for-like sales over Christmas. Richard Lim, CEO at Retail Economics, says:   “These are fantastic results delivered in a challenging market. Shoppers have fallen back in love with M&S, buying into the re-energised proposition that’s centred around a leading omnichannel service. It’s been a mightily impressive turnaround and there’s lots of momentum in the business heading into 2024. “While the outlook remains challenging, they are well-positioned to navigate through these choppy waters.”  Robyn Duffy, senior analyst at RSM UK, says Marks & Spencer has bucked the trend with “stellar” Christmas results. Duffy explains:  “M&S’s strong results in the food arm of the business support the notion that Christmas 2023 was all about time spent at home with friends and family for consumers. 2022’s acquisition of Gist – a deal geared to improve the food supply chain network of the business - has enabled M&S to be more competitive on pricing, a timely strategy considering food inflation is still over 9%. It could also be why M&S has seen a flurry of new customers and an increase in basket size with more customers doing their full shop in M&S food stores.  Clothing and home also performed strongly. Womenswear continues to be a success and is fast becoming a favourite for Millennial women. In addition to gearing the food business to be able to offer greater value to customers, M&S also put this ethos at the forefront of their Christmas ranges. One third of gifts were priced at £10 and under, and 70% at £20 or less. Christmas decorations were down 6% year on year and entry prices for Christmas trees were down 25%. Ultimately, M&S did everything they could to appeal to UK consumers amid cost-of-living pressures and it paid off.”  And here’s Charlie Huggins, manager of the Quality Shares Portfolio at Wealth Club:  “M&S has sustained good momentum over the Christmas period, especially in Food which delivered 7% volume growth, making M&S the top performing grocer over the Christmas period.  M&S also continued to gain share in Clothing and Home, supported by a good womenswear performance. This suggests the turnaround plan to revitalise the brand and reignite growth is very much on track. The Clothing and Home division has been a problem child for M&S for many years. The new strategy, launched last year, aims to improve brand perception and designs, reduce discounting and improve the online offering, while taking a knife to costs and instilling a more entrepreneurial culture. Early signs are this plan is resonating with consumers. While the UK consumer backdrop remains uncertain, there are more positive signs than this time last year, with interest rate cuts likely to relieve some pressure. Combine this with M&S’ self-help initiatives and execution that continues to impress, it suggests recent trading momentum could be sustained.”      7.44am GMT  M&S: higher wages and business rates will increase costs  Marks & Spencer has warned that it faces extra cost pressures, including on pay, and from business rates on its stores. M&S told shareholders in its Christmas trading update:  As we enter the new year and FY25, expectations for economic growth remain uncertain, with consumer and geopolitical risks. We also face additional cost increases from higher than anticipated wage and business rates related cost inflation. Nevertheless, the strong Christmas trading performance provides confidence that the results for the year will be consistent with market expectations.  The minimum wage is due to rise by almost 10% in April, from £10.42 to £11.44 per hour. And although the government froze business rates for small firms in last year’s Autumn Statement, larger businesses will see a 6.7% rise in rates this year.

Tesco and Marks & Spencer have emerged as Christmas winners this morning. Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain, has raised its forecast for profits this financial year, after ringing up record sales in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Tesco’s like-for-like sales in the six-week Christmas period across the UK and the Republic of Ireland were 6.4% higher than a year earlier. That followed growth of 7.3% in the previous 13 weeks, to 25 November. The group now expects to post operating profits of £2.75bn this financial year, above its previous guidance range of £2.6bn to £2.7bn. Chief executive Ken Murphy says it was Tesco’s best Christmas ever, adding:  As part of our focus on value, we offered a full Christmas dinner for just £2.09 per person, helping to drive record sales in the weeks leading up to Christmas and further market share gains. We put a strong focus on quality and innovation too, with over 550 new and improved festive products. Over 18 million customers took the opportunity to treat themselves by shopping from our Finest range, which saw sales growth of nearly 17%. Over the period we cut nearly 2,700 prices, with a further 150 prices cut just this week, cementing our position as the UK’s cheapest full-line grocer.  Tesco also reports it cut prices cut on nearly 2,700 products, with savings of around 10%, another sign that inflation pressures are easing.  Every little helps…*TESCO RAISES FY RETAIL ADJ. OPER PROFIT OUTLOOK TO £2.75B— Michael Brown (@MrMBrown) January 11, 2024  Marks & Spencer has also posted solid like-for-like sales growth, up 8.1% across the UK in the last 13 weeks of the year. That’s better than expected. M&S’s total food sales increased 10.5%, with strong growth in meat, poultry, produce, grocery and in-store bakery products. The recent turnaround in the clothing department continued too, with Clothing & Home sales increasing by 4.8%. M&S says its market share increased, led by the strong performance of womenswear.   Related: How M&S regained its place as UK’s top womenswear retailer   Chief executive Stuart Machin says M&S enters 2024 “with a spring in our step, but clear eyed on the near-term challenges”. Machin says:  We are determined to deliver our objective of driving 1% growth in market share in both businesses and to up the pace of our transformation: keeping a relentless focus on trusted value; accelerating our store rotation and renewal plans; doubling down on our supply chain programmes to improve availability and lower costs; and resetting our data, digital and technology strategy to unlock benefits in future years. Our vision is to be the most trusted retailer, doing the right thing for our customers, with quality products at the heart of everything we do, and we are just at the beginning of what we can achieve.

        "content": "The former head of recruitment at Goldman Sachs is suing the investment bank for more than £1m alleging that demanding him to be “working unreasonable and excessive hours” led to “physical and psychiatric injuries” and “wanting to take his own life”. Ian Dodd, 55, who was Goldman’s global head of recruiting in London between 2018 and 2021, says in a personal injury claim at the high court that he developed a major depressive disorder and heart issues as a result of the workload placed on him by the US bank. “His onerous workload and the associated stress and uncertainty that he faced when working unreasonable and excessive hours, together with the failure of the defendant’s senior leadership partners to provide him with adequate support, culminated in him wanting to take his own life,” lawyers for Dodd said in documents filed at the court made public this week, according to Bloomberg. Goldman’s lawyers said in defence documents that: “If he [Dodd] felt pressure, it was self-generated; it was not imposed on him. If he did work excessive hours, this was not because it was required or expected of him.” A full trial is expected to start in the beginning of 2025. A spokesperson for Goldman said: “We believe these claims are completely without merit.” Dodd previously accused Goldman of having a “culture of bullying”. He claimed that employees frequently “express distress” by crying and that “sobbing through meetings” was common. The extreme hours and working culture of investment banks, including Goldman, has come under scrutiny as junior employees complain about “inhumane” conditions, including 100-hour working weeks and “abuse” from colleagues which has severely affected their mental health. In 2013, Moritz Erhardt, 21, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch intern, was found dead in a shower at his London flat. He had worked for 72 hours in a row and died of an epileptic seizure. Two years later, Sarvshreshth Gupta, 22, a Goldman analyst, took his own life in San Francisco. He was found dead after complaining to his father of working 100-hour weeks. "

        "content": "John Lewis is bringing back its former fashion boss Peter Ruis to lead the department store chain – after more than a decade running retailers including Jigsaw and Anthropologie – in its latest effort to turn around the business. The appointment of an experienced retailer, with 30 years in the industry including stints at Marks & Spencer, Ted Baker and Levi’s before joining John Lewis, and most recently as chief executive of Canada’s Indigo books and homewares chain, comes amid falling sales and profits at the department store. Ruis, who worked at John Lewis between 2005 and 2013, will start next week, replacing Naomi Simcock, who has been interim boss since the abrupt exit of Pippa Wicks almost a year ago. Simcock will take up a new role as operations director for the chain. Ruis will have a long to-do list when he returns to the business, which calls its employees partners as they are co-owners. The department store has struggled amid improved competition from Marks & Spencer, especially online, and the high cost of running its large stores as footfall on high streets has yet to fully recover since the pandemic lockdowns. Wicks was responsible for initiatives including replacing John Lewis’s century-old price-matching pledge, which had weighed heavily on profitability, as well as parting ways with the agency responsible for its famous Christmas campaigns for more than a decade. She also launched its low-cost Anyday range. However, sales continued to decline and the new agency’s Christmas ad was not seen as a major change of direction. Ruis said: “It’s a great privilege to return to the John Lewis Partnership after 10 years. The John Lewis brand is iconic, loved and trusted by millions of customers across the UK and I’m excited to lead the next phase of the transformation. As the biggest employee-owned business in the UK, we have a huge opportunity to make even more of the unique partner difference to provide exceptional products and service for our customers.” Nish Kankiwala, the former Hovis boss who is chief executive of John Lewis Partnership, which owns the department store chain and Waitrose, said Ruis would bring with him “a deep understanding of customers, brands and product from his 30-year career spanning a variety of major high street and online retailers”. “He also brings a clear and proven passion for the John Lewis brand and the partnership model, and I have no doubt he will be integral to our future success,” Kankiwala said. Ruis’s appointment comes amid criticism of a lack of retail experience at the top of the John Lewis Partnership since the arrival of its chair, the former Ofcom boss Dame Sharon White, in early 2020. White has overseen a restructure, including job cuts and store closures, helping the business slash its debts, but also poor retail performance amid increased emphasis on non-retail ventures including financial services and building homes to rent. She is due to step down in February next year."

        "content": "The former boss of a bank linked to the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta has been fined nearly £120,000 for not managing the troubled lender’s exposure properly. Iain Mark Hunter, the former chief executive of Wyelands Bank, will pay a fine of £118,808 for failing to ensure the lender had adequate systems and controls, the Bank of England said on Thursday. Wyelands Bank, which began winding down in March 2020, was part of the Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, a sprawling business empire ranging from finance to metals that was the largest client of Greensill Capital, the financing company that went bust in 2021 after one of its main insurers declined to renew its cover. Greensill employed David Cameron, the foreign secretary and former prime minister, as an adviser at one stage, and was one of the biggest backers of GFG Alliance companies. Hunter has promised not to work in a regulated UK financial sector role in future as part of a settlement with the Bank of England’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Sam Woods, the Bank’s deputy governor for prudential regulation and the PRA’s chief executive, said: “This outcome reflects material breaches of the PRA’s senior manager conduct rules and individual conduct rules. “If senior individuals fail to meet the conduct rules, as Mr Hunter did, it undermines the trust in financial institutions and the wider financial system. Mr Hunter failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that large-exposures risks relating to Wyelands’ business were appropriately identified and mitigated, and failed to take appropriate steps to verify the accuracy of statements he made to the PRA.” Hunter also failed to comply with Wyelands’ internal policy designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest arising from its membership of the GFG Alliance, and failed to take appropriate steps to verify the accuracy of statements he made about Wyelands in two letters he wrote to the PRA, the regulator said. The PRA said Hunter had agreed to settle after the end of the discount period, and therefore did not qualify for a 30% reduction in his fine.  The Bank issued a public reprimand to Wyelands Bank – which Gupta renamed after his country house and estate near Chepstow in south Wales – last April for “wide-ranging significant regulatory failures”. The PRA said it would have fined the lender £8.5m had it not already been in the process of winding down. Wyelands had lent far too much money to GFG and did not have proper strategies in place to manage this risk or to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, it said. GFG said at the time that it had supported the PRA in the process, and had provided funding to ensure that all depositors were repaid in full and that the bank was able to operate to “conclude its solvent wind-down”.

        "content": "Inflation ticked higher in the United States last month as the Federal Reserve weighs the latest stage of its battle against price growth.   Related: US adds 216,000 jobs in December as stronger than expected rise caps robust year   The headline consumer price index increased at an annual pace of 3.4% in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 3.1% in the previous month, and exceeding economists’ expectations of about 3.2%. On a month-to-month basis, the index climbed 0.3%, from 0.1% in November. Housing costs drove the index higher, and were responsible for more than half the headline increase. But there were some signs that inflation continued to soften in December. The so-called “core” consumer price index – a measure that does not include volatile food and energy prices – slowed to an annual rate 3.9%, from 4% the previous month. Energy inflation rose 0.4% last month, as higher electricity prices offset a decline in natural gas costs. Food inflation rose 0.2% in December, in line with November, as menu prices at restaurants and cafes increased more quickly than prices on store shelves. Policymakers, weighing when to start cutting borrowing costs, are closely monitoring price movements across the world’s largest economy as they try to engineer a so-called “soft landing”, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. Inflation has been moderating since it surged to its highest levels in a generation in 2022. The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to cool the world’s largest economy in a bid to curtail price growth, raising interest rates 11 times. The last hike was in July, however, and officials have since opted to wait and see whether they have done enough. Policymakers at the Fed have raised the prospect of cuts to interest rates this year, as price growth heads back towards the central bank’s 2% target. Michael Pearce, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said: “The larger than expected 0.3% rise in consumer prices in December will reverse some of the more aggressive rate cut bets this year, but it does not change our view that inflation is on a bumpy path back to the 2% target.” Inflation in the service sector of the economy is “gradually” slipping, Pearce added. “The trend in broader services inflation will be determined by the strength of wage growth, which is still cooling, thanks to the ongoing normalization in labor market conditions.”"

        "content": "Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket, and Marks & Spencer were both Christmas winners with stronger than expected sales helped by growth in online orders and high demand for festive treats. The supermarket upgraded its profits expectations for the year by £50m to £2.75bn as it reported “a stronger trading performance than anticipated” over the festive period. Sales rose by 6.8% at the group’s UK supermarkets in the four weeks to Christmas, helping the whole group – which includes the wholesale business Booker and supermarkets in central Europe and Ireland – lift sales by 6%. Ken Murphy, the chief executive of Tesco, said: “We stepped up our investment in service over the key festive period, with more colleagues on the shop floor, helping to deliver market-leading availability and making this our best Christmas yet.” He said sales of the group’s premium own-label Finest range had increased by nearly 17% but it had also drawn in shoppers with thousands of price cuts and special discounts for loyalty card holders. Online sales rose by 11.5%, bouncing back from the more difficult period for the online trade, which took a hit as their huge popularity during the pandemic lockdowns dampened.  Murphy said food price inflation was now running at about 3% to 4% but he echoed comments by Sainsbury’s boss, Simon Roberts, earlier this week, saying he did not expect deflation this year as wages continued to rise. He said manufacturers were offering more promotions on their goods, rather than permanent price cuts, in order to win back market share from supermarkets’ own-label products which shoppers have been switching to in order to save money during the cost of living crisis. Shoppers have begun putting more grocery items in their baskets as wage inflation has caught up with price rises, but he added: “We are still in an inflationary period.” Marks & Spencer said food sales in established stores rose by almost 10% in the 13 weeks to 30 December as more shoppers opted to do their full weekly shop with the chain after it cut prices on basics. Sales of the group’s Remarksable value range were up by 18% with strong growth in meat, poultry, produce, grocery and in-store bakery. M&S took its highest market share on fashion in a decade as clothing and homewares sales at established stores increased by 4.8%. M&S said it had discounted fewer items than a year before despite a mild autumn that led to heavy promotions across the market. “We held our nerve in early November,” said Stuart Machin, the chief executive of M&S, adding that the tactic paid off as full price sales had come through later in the season. Womenswear sales were particularly strong as the company improved its style credentials and won over shoppers with velvet suits and sequins. Knitwear, party outfits, and the brand’s premium Autograph line performed well with sales up by more than 10%. Online M&S clothing and homewares sales rose by 10.9%, the company said with many shoppers opting to pick up their orders from stores. Machin said: “Our strategy to reshape M&S for growth has enabled sustained sales momentum across food and clothing and home over the Christmas period. We enter 2024 with a spring in our step, but clear eyed on the near-term challenges.” He said the company had “good momentum” in new year trading but its shoppers were still “slightly cautious about what the next 12 months will bring” amid uncertainty about elections in the UK. M&S does not expect to put up prices this year as inflationary pressures had eased. However, Machin said M&S may have to absorb some increased costs, and availability of some items – mainly clothing – may be affected in February and March as a result of attacks on container ships in the Red Sea that were forcing shipping companies to reroute to avoid the area and delaying deliveries. He said alcohol deliveries could also be affected to some extent. Tesco also said that the problems in the Red Sea might lead to more inflation as extended shipping times would diminish capacity in the system and drive up prices if the attacks continued for some time. Murphy said Tesco and food retailers were less affected by the delays and the company was working on alternative sources of supply for those items affected."

        "content": "The Bank of England may be forced to bring forward the date of its first interest rate cut after three leading forecasters issued a surprise update suggesting the inflation rate will halve to 2% by April. The Oxford Economics consultancy and analysts at Investec and Deutsche Bank have reassessed their outlook for inflation in 2024 and concluded that the consumer prices index (CPI), which dropped to 3.9% in November last year, will fall below 2% within four months. A slump in energy prices and the cost of oil on international wholesale markets will, they say, bring down inflation at a faster rate than the Bank of England expected when it reviewed price rises in November. The independent forecasters said a fresh review next month by officials at the Bank’s headquarters on Threadneedle Street was likely to follow their lead and predict a much lower path for inflation this year. In a series of speeches before Christmas, members of the BoE’s interest rate setting committee said lending rates would remain high during 2024 to reduce the prospect of a return to galloping price rises. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, had predicted a tough battle lay ahead to bring inflation back to its 2% target, pushing back against speculation in the financial markets that official borrowing costs would soon be reduced from their current level of 5.25%. Since then financial markets have brought forward betting on the first likely interest rate cut to April and raised the likelihood of another five cuts before the end of the year, bringing interest rates below 4% for the first time since January 2023. At a hearing of the Treasury committee on Wednesday, Bailey said he hoped the recent fall in the cost of mortgages would continue. “Obviously we have had a big change in market interest rates in the last few months and so the cost of mortgages is coming down,” he said. Bailey refused to comment on the outlook for monetary policy, but said: “Let’s just take the market for a moment – obviously that is feeding through into mortgage costs and I hope that is something that continues.” The rates for mortgages fixed over five years have tumbled in response to growing optimism about the fall in inflation. Investors have tended to disregard warnings about higher costs pushing inflation higher, including concerns about the Suez canal and a spike in shipping costs resulting from the war in the Middle East. Energy and fuel prices have declined on international wholesale markets, pushing down the cost of heating and transport. The cost of food, which is influenced by transport costs, is also expected to fall steeply this year. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said he expected the CPI to average 2.1% in 2024, down from a forecast in November of 3.1%. “Inflation is on track to return to the 2% target in April,” he added. Phil Shaw, senior UK economist at Investec, said the impact of tax cuts by the chancellor in the autumn statement, which he believed would raise consumer spending and persuade the BoE to keep interest rates high, was less than expected. He said inflation would fall to 1.5% in the third quarter of the year and the first rate cut would be implemented in June. Economists at Deutsche Bank predicted that UK inflation could drop “a little below 2% in April and May”, before hovering around 2% to 2.5% for the remainder of the year. Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said there were risks to his forecast. He said strong wage increases would put pressure on firms to raise prices and further tax cuts could increase consumer spending, allowing shops to charge more for goods and services. Raja added: “The recent disruption in global supply chains may also arrest the disinflationary momentum we’re seeing in goods and food prices. We will be monitoring these risks carefully.”"

        "content": "Handing back a CBE costs nothing, financially speaking. So it is little wonder that Paula Vennells, former chief executive of the Post Office, has discovered that returning her absurd award has prompted another question. Yes, but what about your bonuses? The demand is obviously fair. And, critically, it is fair even according to the rules of the bonus scheme that operated during her seven years at the top from 2012 and 2019. Both the short-term incentive plan (STIP) and long-term (LTIP) at the Post Office clearly stated that there could be situations in which bonuses could be cancelled and individuals told to return cash.   Related: Key Horizon campaigner says more needs to be done over Post Office scandal   This wording is from the Post Office’s 2012-13 accounts (page 52) and near-identical versions can be found in every subsequent year of Vennells’s tenure: “Executive directors have clawback clauses in their contracts, as well as the STIP and LTIP rules, which provide for the return of any overpayments in the event of misstatement of the accounts, error or gross misconduct on the part of an executive. These provisions are in line with market best practice.” Any debate about a watertight definition of “gross misconduct” shouldn’t detain the lawyers too long on this occasion. Despite a report in 2012 from external reviewers that the Horizon IT system was “not fit for purpose”, the Post Office continued prosecutions until 2015 and then spent millions of pounds defending itself until the damning high court judgment in 2019. Vennells’s incentive payments add up to £2.2m over the course of her time in charge. She may note that when James Crosby, former boss of HBOS, gave up his knighthood in 2013 after a parliamentary committee found he “sowed the seeds” of destruction at the bank, he volunteered to surrender 30% of his pension entitlement. Those were the days before clawback clauses but Crosby was nodding to the principle that giving up a gong is not enough. In a post-clawback world, matters should be simpler: the rules are meant to insist on repayment of bonuses. If the relevant clauses aren’t triggered in Vennells’s case, when would they be? None of which is to deny that the rotten saga goes further than her. The politicians with oversight roles of the state-owned Post Office clearly have questions to answer, as do the relevant executives at Fujitsu, supplier of the dodgy IT software. But, among the business crew at the top of the Post Office over the years, the two chairs during Vennells’s time must explain why they backed the executives to the hilt.  Part of the job of a chair is meant to be about challenging groupthink and confirmation bias and spotting when an organisation may have got something spectacularly wrong.  The individuals in this case were Alice Perkins (2011-15) and Tim Parker (2015-22). But the inquiry also needs to go further back to the pre-Vennells period when the prosecutions started. “I did not have any involvement in the Horizon issue during my time at Royal Mail,” said BT Group chair Adam Crozier, who was chief executive from 2003 to 2010 of the pre-demerged entity that managed Royal Mail and the Post Office, this week. That statement reads like a variation on “don’t blame me, I was only the boss”. But, if it’s really the case that the Post Office was left to do its own thing within the wider Royal Mail organisation, then the question is who was supposed to be accountable for the biggest IT project in Europe at the time? Was Allan Leighton, chair of Royal Mail during Crozier’s time, supposed to have an eye on both operations? Or should the inquiry first be hearing from the likes of Alan Cook, later chair of insurer LV= but managing director of the Post Office from 2006 to 2010? If in doubt, summon the lot. It is important that some fuller version of boardroom accountability is established. But retrieving Vennells’s bonuses ought to be straightforward. If he’s doing his job, Henry Staunton, today’s chair of the Post Office, should be on the case already."

That poses very different challenges to regulators than other crypto assets.\n[Stablecoins are backed by a specified asset or basket of assets which they use to maintain a stable value against that asset].\nBailey, though, suggests they are not stable enough yet, comparing them to “opaque” money market funds.\n\n\n\n 4.27pm GMT \nBailey: Crypto assets have lost momentum\n\nDanny Kruger MP quizzes the Bank officials about the financial risks from cryptocurrency.\nQ: What is your prediction for how crypto assets are taken up by the financial system?\nAndrew Bailey says these unbacked crypto assets (as opposed to stablecoins) are not taking off as a means of payment.\nUsing bitcoin is fairly inefficient, so it is not taking off generally as a payments method, the BoE governor says. The momentum of a few years ago has not kept up, he adds.\nBailey then repeats a point he has made often before, that bitcoin has no intrinsic value.\n\nPeople may want it extrinsically, because they want to end things, but it doesn’t have intrinsic value.\n\nQ: Bitcoin’s rise over the last year (up 150%) suggests a lot of people think it’s the future… Kruger points out.\nDeputy governor Sarah Breeden says the lack of regulatory framework has prevented traditional finance from getting involved in bitcoin in a safe way.\nThis is changing, with the UK laying out a crypto regime and the SEC considering a bitcoin ETF, Breeden adds.\n\n Related: SEC says ‘compromised’ account to blame for tweet approving Bitcoin ETF \n\n\n\n\n 4.18pm GMT \n\nThérèse Coffey MP, a new member of the Treasury committee (following November’s cabniet reshuffle), asked the Bank of England about the risks from China’s property sector.\nQ: Are banks taking steps to mitigate against potential losses here?\nBoE deputy governor Sarah Breeden says risks in the China property market have been crystallising since 2021.\nBanks exposed to China have been taking impairment charges (losses) on the back of that, Breeden points out.\nFrom a financial stability perspective, the BoE hasn’t yet seen signs of problems in China’s property sector spilling into the wider Chinese economy. And if that does, the BoE is confident that UK banks are resilient enough to cope.\n\n\n\n 4.14pm GMT \n\nInvestec also predict UK inflation will drop to the Bank’s 2% target sooner than previously thought.\nIn a new research note this afternoon, they say:\n\nWe are now of the view that the headline rate of CPI inflation will moderate closer to 1.5% in Q3 this year, from its current rate of 3.9% and below the 2.0% target.\n\nInvestec predict that this will allow the Bank to cut interest rates three times this year, down to 4.5% by December.\n\n\n\n 4.00pm GMT \n\nAndrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, is in the same camp as Deutsche’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, when it comes to inflation. \nThey expect a drop over the next few months to the Bank of England’s 2% target rate, as Deutsche also forecast today (see earlier post).\nGoodwin said: \n\n“The UK inflation outlook has been transformed by steep falls in oil and gas prices and the recent softening in core price pressures. We now expect CPI inflation to average 2.1% in 2024, down from our November forecast of 3.1%. Inflation is on track to return to the 2% target in April.\n“Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks and the Ofgem energy price cap is on track to fall by 12% in April. Our commodities team has also cut its forecast for oil prices following recent declines. We expect these two categories to knock more than 1 percetange point off CPI inflation in 2024, with the drag in April being as high as 1.6ppts.\n\nHe added: \n\n“Even before the recent falls in oil and gas prices, the Bank of England’s inflation forecasts had looked too high. We expect the BoE to lower its projections significantly in February’s Monetary Policy Report, as it begins to prepare the ground for rate cuts. Lower inflation means we also expect stronger growth in real household incomes and GDP this year.”\n\n\n\n\n 3.58pm GMT \nBailey: We're watching Red Sea crisis closely\n\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said he is monitoring the situation in the Red Sea closely as attacks on the vital shipping lane has rerouted cargo ships away from the Suez Canal.\nBailey told MPs today:\n\n“We’ve certainly seen – as best we can tell from the monitoring – shipping traffic is being affected and is being rerouted. That will increase shipping prices and shipping costs. I think initially that will be an issue in the monetary policy world.\n“I would say one of the things, fortunately, that hasn’t happened is that we have not had a prolonged spike in oil prices.\n“We had a bit of an initial spike and at the moment we’re seeing that, if anything, the oil price is actually coming down a bit, and there seems to be some price management to keep it there.\n“This is very helpful because clearly quite a bit of the shipping traffic that goes through those straits and through the Suez Canal is oil, oil and liquefied natural gas.\n“We have to watch it very carefully, though, because it is obviously having an effect.”\n\n\n\n\n 3.35pm GMT \n\nQ: Has the Bank exposed UK to financial risk by scrapping its mortgage affordability test in August 2022?\n[that test forced borrowers to show they could afford a three-percentage-point rise in interest rates before they could be approved for a home loan].\nDeputy governor Sarah Breedon says the test isn’t needed, as the UK also has an affordability test enforced by the FCA, and a macroprudential loan to income limit on loans. \nThose two measures provide sufficient resilience, she argues.\nQ: So you don’t see any circumstances where you might bring it back this year?\nAndrew Bailey does not.\n\n\n\n 3.28pm GMT \n\nQ: How about credit card debt?\nAndrew Bailey says the Bank watches this area closely, but it isn’t seeing a substantial upturn in credit card arrears.\n\n\n\n 3.27pm GMT \n\nQ: Which households will have a worse 2024 than others, in relation to their mortgage rates?\nAndrew Bailey says the rental market is more stretched, as lower-income households are more likely to rent than own their own home.\nRental inflation is running at around 6%, says Bailey, who adds he “really hopes” that comes down.\n\n\n\n 3.16pm GMT \nBoE governor Bailey: Hopes mortgage rates will keep falling\n\nLabour MP Keir Mather asks the Bank of England about the impact of high interest rates on mortgages.\nQ: How confident are you that increases in mortgage payments won’t have any serious financial repercussions?\nVery good question, Andrew Bailey says.\nHe reiterates his earlier point that while some households are really struggling, in aggregate households are not as stretched as they were after the financial crisis (see here).\nBailey points out that unemployment remains relatively low, as does the number of borrowers in arrears while repossessions are now rare.\nHe says:\n\nOne of the worst things we have in the past was a big upturn in repossessions and the suffering that caused for people.\n\n[However, recent data has shown a rise in households behind on their payments, while the the number of buy to let mortgages in arrears has doubled in a year].\nBailey then adds that there has been a big change in market expectations for interest rates.\n[Investors think they are now at their peak, at 5.25%, having previously expected them to hit 6%, which has sparked a flurry of cuts to mortgage rates in recent weeks].\nThe governor says:\n\n“Obviously we have had a big change in market interest rates in the last few months and so the cost of mortgages is coming down.”\n\nBailey adds that he hopes this continues.\n\n Related: HSBC joins mortgage rate-cutting drive with deals below 4% \n\n\nUpdated at 3.17pm GMT\n\n\n 3.08pm GMT \n\nThe committee turns to the Bank’s countercyclical buffer, a tool which allows the BoE to influence how much capital banks build up.\nThe Bank left the buffer unchanged at 2% in November, having been cut to 0% early in the pandemic. \nQ: Is there a case for changing the buffer this year?\nFPC external member Carolyn Wilkins says the committee sees 2% as a neutral rate – it could raise it, if it thought risks to the banking sector had increased, or if the BoE wanted to ensure banks could withstand shock without having to tighten credit.\nAlternatively, if deteriorating credit conditions were likely to lead to a cutback in lending, the Bank could lower the buffer.\nFPC external member Jonathan Hall tells MPs to rember that the buffer is meant to be counter cyclical to the financial and credit cycle, not to the economic cycle.\nSo it should be used to encourage banks to build up capital in the good times, ready for a rainy day, so the banks can support the real economy through a shock.\n\n\n\n 2.55pm GMT \n\"No evidence\" that QT is causing stability problems\n\nThe commitee turns to the Bank of England’s quantitative tightening progamme, though which it is selling some of the bonds it bought after the 2008 financial crisis and in the pandemic.\nQ: Will those sales of £100bn of bonds this year, when the government is also selling bonds (to fund the deficit) have an impact on financial stability?\nDeputy governor Sarah Breeden says QT sales could have a limited impact on bond yields in the markets. \n[if there is a glut of bonds, prices will fall, and yields will go up].\nBreeden says the Bank lays out its bond sales plans clearly, and all the evidence is that there has not been any impact on market functioning or financial stability.\nQT will lower the amount of reserves held by commercial banks, Breeden points out.

But in aggregate, UK households with mortgages are not as stretched as they were during the global financial crisis 15 years ago, he argues.\nBailey says the Bank looks at the “cost of living adjusted debt service ratio” which takes household income, deducts essential spending, and then compares the residual income to household debt service costs.\nBailey says:\n\nIt’s interesting to look at that, [as] it is nowhere near as stretched as it was during the global financial crisis period.

Unsurprisingly you get a better number.\n“That’s the situation here. The situation with HS2 in my opinion is the estimate was poor, the budget was set too early, and then when you get further into it, you get much better information.\n“Then on that basis, you can cost it out with more accuracy and then you discover it’s higher.”\n\n\n\n\n 11.03am GMT \n\nWhy has the estimated cost of HS2 continued to climb, and climb, over the years, from a first estimate of £33bn for the full line in 2010?\nAccording to HS2 Ltd executive chairman Sir Jon Thompson there are several reasons – inflation is clearly a factor, but also the original budgets were too low, there have been changes to the scope of the line, and poor delivery.\nThompson told MPs this morning:\n\n“This is a systemic problem. It’s not just about HS2, it’s about large projects that the Government funds.\n“The budget needs to be set early on in order for an outline business case to be approved by the Government, sometimes by Parliament.\n“At that point, people think OK the original estimate for Phase 1 was £30 billion-something.\n“That is based on very, very immature data. You don’t have a design, you haven’t procured anything, there is no detail on which you can cost anything.”\n\nMy colleague Gwyn Topham looked into this issue last year, showing how soaring prices of construction materials and labour shortages had driven up costs, while many tunnels had been build along the HS2 route as a concession to MPs in Conservative marginal seats.\n\n Related: ‘We are a political project’: how HS2’s costs have spiralled out of control \n\n\n\n\n 10.36am GMT \nCost of HS2 from London-Birmingham jumps to £66bn\n\nThe estimated cost of building the HS2 rail link between London and Birmingham has soared by up to £10bn to as much as £66.6bn, MPs have heard this morning.\nHS2 Ltd executive chairman Sir Jon Thompson told told the Transport Select Committee that the estimated cost for Phase 1 is between £49bn and £56.6bn at 2019 prices.\nHowever, adjusting the range for current prices involves “adding somewhere between eight and 10 billion pounds”, Thompson explained (PA Media reports), reflecting the impact of inflation on the line’s cost.\nHe went on:\n\n“It is the Government’s long-standing policy that infrastructure estimates are only updated at Spending Review points, that’s my understanding of it.\n“So that’s why we’re still working to 2019 prices and the whole conversation about 2019, which is to be frank with you an administrative burden of some significance in the organisation.”\n\nBack in October, Rishi Sunak cancelled the northern leg of HS2 from Birmingham to Manchester, but the government is pressing on with the London-Birmingham link, the first phase of the line.\n\n Related: Rishi Sunak announces scaling back of HS2 in Tory conference speech \n\n\nUpdated at 10.41am GMT\n\n\n 10.27am GMT \n\nGeopolitical tensions in the Middle East are another global risk.\nAsked about this, Carolina Klint, chief commercial officer for Europe at Marsh, warns that we can expect the attacks on traffic in the Red Sea to continue, as there are no signs of the situation calming down.\nKlint told reporters in London:\n\nIt is becoming almost impossible, taking container ships now through the Suez Canal without risking the lives of the crew, and without putting them in harm’s way.\nOf course that is a critical point because it’s not only about protecting a big ship or protecting the containers but first and foremost, of course, it’s the human lives at risk.\n\nEalier today US and UK warships repelled a barrage of 20 Houthi rockets, drones and cruise missiles fired at ships in the Red Sea.\n\n Related: Middle East crisis live: US and UK repel major Houthi attack in Red Sea \n\n\nUpdated at 10.35am GMT\n\n\n 10.09am GMT \n91% of risk experts are pessimistic about 10-year outlook\n\nAround 17% of the experts surveyed for WEF’s Global Risks report fear the global outlook will be ‘stormy’ over the next decade, with global catastrophe risks rising.\nNearly half of the 1,400-strong panel predict turbulent times, bringing upheavals and an ‘elevated risk’ of global catastrophes.\nJust 1% believe there’s a negligible risk of global catastrophes in the next 10 years, as this chart from today’s report shows:\nJohn Scott, head of sustainability Risk at Zurich Insurance Group, says:\n\n“The world is undergoing significant structural transformations with AI, climate change, geopolitical shifts and demographic transitions.

However, despite the sluggish numbers, this was actually ahead of Persimmon’s forecast from March last year, which predicted completed sales to be between 8,000 and 9,000 in 2023. This was largely driven by a strong fourth quarter, when Persimmon completed 4,234 homes – nearly as many as the 4,249 homes completed in the first six months of the year. Looking ahead, the housebuilder said that market conditions remained highly uncertain, particularly for first-time buyers. \nPersimmon says:\n\nWe anticipate market conditions will remain highly uncertain during 2024, particularly for first-time buyers and with an election likely this year.\n\nHowever, it said that there were positive signs with mortgage rates beginning to ease and build costs beginning to moderate both benefiting completion numbers.

Greggs’ sales growth slowed in October-December, though, with like-for-like sales up 9.4% – due to a “reduced contribution from price inflation”.\nThat slowdown in price rises should continue, Greggs suggests, in a boost to consumers.\nGreggs says:\n\nAs expected, inflationary pressures are reducing and with good forward cover on food, packaging and energy we anticipate a more stable cost base in the coming year.\nWage inflation remains, although higher rates of pay across the economy will also provide support to consumer incomes.\n\nOfficial data has shown that consumer price pressures slowed last year, with inflation slowing to 3.9%.\n\n Related: UK interest rates expected to fall sharply next year as inflation drops to 3.9% \n\nGreggs also reports high sales of its Festive Bake, Chocolate Orange Muffin and Christmas Lunch Baguette in the fourth quarter of last year, while pizza sales continue to grow too.\nWe also have Christmas trading figures from supermarket chain J Sainsbury this morning. And they also point to easing inflation pressures.\nSainsbury’s has reported a jump in sales over the key Christmas period, with improved grocery sales volumes as food and drink inflation slowed.\nGrocery sales in the last 16 weeks rose by 9.3%, while sales over Christmas were 8.6% higher. Sainsbury’s says stronger volume growth offset lower inflation, and is sticking with its existing profit forecasts.\nSainsbury’s says:\n\nOur consistent focus on delivering great value, innovation, quality and service has driven sustained sales growth despite significantly lower inflation, with volume growth ahead of the market every week since March.\n\nHowever, the firm witnessed a drop in trade for clothing and in its Argos business.\nSales at Argos, the catalogue business, fell by 4.2% in the six weeks over Christmas (to 6th January), suggesting consumers cut back in the cost of living squeeze.\nAlso coming up today\nThe World Economic Forum will release its latest Global Risks report this morning, highlighting the most serious threats which global leaders must tackle.\nThis afternoon, MPs on the Treasury Committee will question senior officials from the Bank of England, about the threat to financial stability posed by interest rate rises.\nThe committee is likely to examine the impact of recent UK interest rate rises on the UK’s economic resilience and financial stability.\nThe committee says:\n\nThe decision to increase and then hold the Bank Rate has seen UK households and businesses face rapidly increasing running costs while borrowing also becomes a more costly option.\nMembers of the Committee are likely to probe whether these pressures could have implications for the UK’s economic resilience.\n\nThe agenda\n\n9.30am GMT: World Economic Forum releases its Global Risks Report 2024.\n2.15pm GMT: Treasury committee to quiz Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and senior colleagues\n\n\nUpdated at 7.52am GMT\n"

        "content": "Pressure is mounting on the government to review more than £2bn in new contracts awarded to Fujitsu since a court ruling in 2019 found its Horizon IT system caused accounting errors that were blamed on more than 900 post office operators who were then wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office. The Japanese company, which continues to hold the prestigious status of being a key “strategic supplier” making more than £100m annually from government work despite the scandal, has won 101 new contracts worth £2.04bn since the landmark legal ruling. These include new contracts with the Home Office, HM Revenue and Customs, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Department for Work and Pensions, according to the government procurement analysts Tussell.   Related: What is the Post Office Horizon IT scandal all about?   The figure does not include the £2.4bn lifetime contract with the Post Office for the faulty Horizon system, which prompted what has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. On Wednesday, the Scottish government moved to review some contracts awarded to Fujitsu after criticism of its role in the scandal. Angela Constance, Scotland’s justice secretary, said she would discuss a deal signed in 2020 with Fujitsu to support electronic vote counts for local elections with fellow ministers. The Cabinet Office did not respond to questions about whether it would follow Scotland’s lead and review Fujitsu contracts or the company’s strategic supplier status, or why it had continued to be awarded business after Horizon was proved to be faulty. “I have no idea why the government is continuing to give Fujitsu contracts – very, very big contracts,” said the Conservative former cabinet minister David Jones. “I can’t understand why the government wants to continue to deal with them.” The 2019 court of appeal ruling determined that the Post Office had been in “denial” about “bugs, errors and flaws” in Horizon in the “21st-century equivalent of maintaining the Earth is flat”, marking a turning point for victims. Fujitsu has made almost £7bn from 200 IT contracts since 2012. Its four biggest repeat customers are the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office, HMRC and the Financial Conduct Authority, which gave it 68 contracts between them worth more than £2.7bn since 2012. The company, which has never faced any form of punishment for its role in the Horizon scandal, has £2.9bn worth of public sector contracts due to expire over the next two years. On Wednesday, Kevin Hollinrake, the UK minister with responsibility for postal affairs, said Fujitsu could face “financial sanctions” to help fund compensation for subpostmasters and their families if it is found at fault. Fujitsu executives have been summoned to give evidence to MPs on the Commons business and trade committee next week.The Metropolitan police have interviewed two Fujitsu employees under caution in relation to allegations of perjury and perverting the course of justice related to Post Office trials. In 2013, the security companies G4S and Serco handed back their contracts to electronically tag criminals after fraud allegations over the way they charged the government for their services. The government has a list of 39 strategic suppliers, with each assigned a crown representative, who are members of the commercial relationships board (CRB), which meets monthly and assigns an overall performance rating of black, red, amber or green (RAG) to each company. The Cabinet Office ultimately oversees suppliers and contracts. Vincent Kelly, who has held roles at Logica, the mobile phone company Orange and music royalties collection body PRS for Music, is the crown representative for suppliers including Fujitsu and Virgin Media O2 and has worked in the role for the Cabinet Office since 2018. In 2018, after the collapse of the outsourcing company Carillion, the public accounts committee (PAC) moved to investigate “weaknesses” in government contracting. The subsequent report criticised the government for running a procurement process that incentivised cost controls and not ensuring the right supplier was selected. “It must look with fresh eyes at the motivations of companies currently bidding for central government work, and develop a strategy that requires contract-awarding bodies to look beyond bottom-line costs,” said Meg Hillier, the PAC chair, at the time. “Crucial to this will be to embed procurement best practice across departments.” It also criticised the RAG rating system as not working “either as a carrot or a stick” and said there must always be “effective oversight” of the crown representative system and the close relationship enjoyed with suppliers. “Without effective oversight of these relationships there is a risk that strategic suppliers become secretive ‘sub-departments’ of Whitehall,” said Hillier. A government spokesperson said: “This was one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history, which is why we set up an independent inquiry to establish culpability and are bringing forward legislation to make sure those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.“It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account – both legally and financially.“Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu’s conduct and commercial performance under review.”"

        "content": "Michael Gove has refused to set a deadline for an independent report on allegations of “corruption, wrongdoing and illegality” at Teesworks, the industrial development within the government’s high-profile freeport project. The levelling up secretary ordered a review into financial dealings and governance at the joint venture between Tory Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen’s South Tees Development Corporation and companies run by two local developers. After political anger that Gove had declined to act on calls to bring in the National Audit Office to lead the investigation – instead announcing that it would be undertaken by an independent panel of his choosing – local MPs have criticised delays in the process before mayoral elections on Teesside in May. Gove said he hoped the inquiry would report before voters go to the ballot box, but refused to commit to a timeline under questioning from MPs on the Commons business committee on Wednesday. “I always wanted it to be as quickly as possible, but it’s also important that it is comprehensive,” he said. The government had intended that the investigation, led by the chief executive of Lancashire county council, Angie Ridgwell, would be completed last summer. However, it was delayed until autumn, then winter, and then this coming spring. The north-east Labour MP Ian Lavery told Gove there was a “big feeling this has been kicked into the long grass because of the mayoral elections in Teesside” and asked the levelling up secretary to give a commitment that this was not the case. Gove said he could not “force the hand of an independent investigator” to hurry out a report and declined to commit to publication before the election. “The team know that we’d like them to report as quickly and comprehensively as possible,” he said. “Of course, no one wants it published more than Ben Houchen himself, because he wants the mayoral election to be about what he’s achieved, his record, his plans for the future, and for all of these issues to be out there, tackled, and people being able to make a judgment based on the facts.” The questions for the government come after Teesworks reported that net profits had tripled last year to £54m, according to details first reported this week by the Financial Times. The venture had been transferred in late 2021 from a 50-50 public-private partnership, established in 2020, to majority private ownership, with two Teesside developers – Chris Musgrave and Martin Corney – increasing their stake to 90%. Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business committee, said Teesworks’ accounts showed 110 acres of public land had been bought by a company 90% owned by “friends and close associates of Lord Houchen” for £1 an acre, resulting in the generation of profits “which have now largely gone out to these private shareholders”. Asking Gove if best value for taxpayers had been secured, he said: “A company that has bought 110 acres for £1 an acre is now turning over £143m and shovelling £50m out to private shareholders in profits.” The levelling up secretary said he could not “pre-empt” the outcome of the review, but argued he had full confidence in Houchen. “I have the highest regard for him,” he said. “In all of my observations and dealings with him, I think he’s a first-rate public servant who has been responsible for the economic transformation of the Tees valley, and he is a great and visionary leader in local government.”"

        "content": "Eton college has been forced to delay the start of school term after the toilets in its boarding houses backed up because of flooding in the Thames Water sewers caused by recent heavy rains. The £46,000-a-year private school apologised to parents, saying pupils would begin the year learning remotely online, after the water company informed it of the issue. Pupils had been due to return to the prestigious boys’ school, near Windsor in Berkshire, on Tuesday after the Christmas break. “I am very sorry to say that Thames Water have just alerted us to the fact that their sewerage drains are backfilling due to floodwater,” said an email sent to parents and guardians, first reported by Bloomberg. “The sewers in the centre of Eton won’t cope with the arrival of nearly 1,350 boys.” The school added: “We cannot safely operate as a school until Thames Water have resolved the issues around our sewerage drains.” Eton was founded in 1440 by Henry VI, offering a free education for all and charging some for accommodation. Former pupils include Boris Johnson, Prince William, Prince Harry and David Cameron. The site has the main college and 24 “Oppidan”, or residential, houses, each with a house master and a clutch of staff. A spokesperson for Eton said: “Following extensive flooding in the region, the Thames Water sewers which serve the town of Eton flooded. “Therefore boys could not return for the scheduled start of term on 9 January and the college has moved to remote teaching. We are in regular contact with Thames Water as they seek to resolve the situation and we look forward to welcoming boys back as soon as possible.” Thames Water said: “Our engineers are responding to reported sewerage issues at Eton college, Windsor. “In this instance, the recent heavy rainfall, along with high groundwater levels and river flooding, caused our local sewer system to overload. “We are sorry to staff and students who have been impacted. Our teams will be carrying out a clean-up in the coming days once the river levels recede.” The high-profile incident marks an embarrassing start for Chris Weston, the former chief executive of the power-generating equipment company Aggreko, who took over at Thames Water this week. He is tasked with improving the performance at the debt-laden utility company which has 15 million customers in London and south-east England and has faced criticism from the public and politicians over leaky pipes and releasing sewage into waterways. Large parts of England have suffered flooding since the start of the year, as Storm Henk brought a deluge of rain. In a statement released on Monday night, Thames said recent heavy rainfall, combined with a high water table, have put “huge pressure on our sewers and pumping stations”. “Water is entering our network above and below ground, and flows from flooded rivers are adding to the problem in some areas,” it said. Thames’s Slough sewage treatment works, near Eton, was discharging pollution into the Roundmoor Ditch on Wednesday, according to company data analysed by the website Sewage Map."

        "content": "BrewDog is facing anger from its employees after dropping out of the accredited real living wage scheme – hiring new staff on the legal minimum instead and freezing pay for bar staff in London as the company tries to reduce costs amid continuing losses. In a letter seen by the Guardian, the brewer and bar operator, which is best known for its Punk IPA beer, said new workers were being hired on the legal minimum wage of £10.42 an hour for those aged 23 and over. This is below the independently verified living wage of £10.90 that existing staff get. Pay for workers outside London will increase to £11.44 an hour from 1 April, in line with the new legal minimum for those aged 21 and over. However, that will be below the new real living wage of £12 an hour that accredited employers pledge to pay from April. In the capital there will be no increase in the minimum pay offered by BrewDog from April, with the rate for bar staff staying at £11.95 an hour, well below the £13.15 London real living wage being introduced that month. Living costs have increased in the city, with rents soaring last year. Workers reacted with anger on the group’s internal messaging system, with one saying: “I’ve been at BrewDog long enough to see every benefit that attracted me to the job either binned or completely reduced. “The effective cutting of our pay again when cost of living is only getting worse, especially in the city that is home to the business’s flagship bar, by a company that prides itself on its ethical ‘underdog’ image and supposed moral values is wildly questionable on both ethical and moral grounds.” Another member of staff told the Guardian: “Last year there was a staff vote surrounding benefits and what staff want to keep. No 1 was the real living wage. Barely a year later and they’ve turned back on their promise.” Bryan Simpson, the lead organiser on hospitality at the Unite union, said: “BrewDog has been paying the real living wage since 2015. To withdraw it now, during the most acute cost of living crisis in a generation is outrageous. “We are already working with our BrewDog members across the country to collectively challenge this awful decision and force the senior management of the company to do the right thing by the workers who have made them millions.” The Punks with Purpose campaign group of former staff said: “BrewDog management’s decision to revoke a long-standing commitment to the real Living Wage proves that there is no principle too dearly held for them to abandon. ” The group also criticised the dropping of Brewdog’s scheme in which 50% of a bar’s profits were shared with staff. However, the company says that scheme was changed to a 10% profit share and £1 per hour bonus for good customer service after a staff vote last year. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: “We are disappointed that Brewdog have chosen to stop paying the real Living Wage. The independently calculated real Living Wage is the only UK wage rate based on the cost of living and it is voluntarily paid by over 14,000 organisations. Despite tough economic times, it’s been heartening to see record numbers of businesses join the movement.” BrewDog told workers it was making the “important but necessary … hard decisions” on pay despite a good festive period for the business. “Even with this strong performance over Christmas, as a wider business there is no hiding from the fact that in 2023 we made a trading loss and despite many efforts in the past 12 months to reduce our spending we still need to find more ways to get this business back to profitability and the financial stability that is needed. Inevitably, this does mean making some hard decisions,” the company wrote. A spokesperson for BrewDog said: “Despite unprecedented challenges in the hospitality sector – our staff outside London will be getting a 4.95% increase in base pay, and crew currently working in London will be paid 4.5% above the national living wage. “We have always been fully committed to doing the best we can for our people, and our benefits package is far more generous than the industry average. “Last year we gave over £350,000 to our bars team via our unique profit share programme. Our team also benefits from a unique bonus scheme which sees all crew members receive an additional £1 an hour for the month for surpassing customer service standards.” Meanwhile, BrewDog is thought to be considering a stock market flotation. In 2021, staff accused the company’s chief executive and co-founder, James Watt, of presiding over a “culture of fear” in which workers were mistreated. The company disputed some of the allegations, apologised for others, and in 2022 lost its B Corp status, which offers certifies a company’s ethical commitment to the environment, community and staff."

        "content": "When retail spending surges, the Reserve Bank can be of a mind to raise rates and slow the economy even more. But the big jump in spending in November is not a sign that we are flush with cash; more that our habits have changed and we love (and need) a bargain. The monthly retail trade figures are a prime example of how analysing the economy requires more than just looking at numbers. To understand them you need to know what is happening in the real world. In November, Australians spent 2% more in the shops than they did in October in “seasonally adjusted terms” (remember that phrase – I am going to come back to it). Had that happened before the pandemic it would have been an absolutely massive event.   Related: Economic data shows households are feeling the pinch. But will the RBA stop raising rates? | Greg Jericho   To give it some context, when the iPhone 6 was introduced in September 2014, total retail trade rose just 1.2% and that was considered an anomaly. You could basically count on retail spending going up by about 0.3% each month and really there was not too much to get excited about. And then in March 2020 the world changed.    If the graph does not display click here The 2.0% increase in November is just the eighth-biggest monthly jump in retail spending in the past four years. But this was not due to the pandemic – rather it was Black Friday sales and how our shopping habits have changed more broadly. It is here we need to talk about “seasonally adjusted” and what that means. In reality we didn’t actually spend 2% more money (roughly $730m) in the shops in November than in October; we spent 7.5% more – equal to an extra $2.7bn changing hands. The reason we don’t report that is because that is the “original data” and original data is pretty wacky:    If the graph does not display click here Every year we spend most of our money in the shops in December. The month we spend the second-highest amount is November (February is always the lowest month). We don’t report the original data because it is kind of meaningless.   Related: Australia’s cost-of-living crisis isn’t about the price of groceries. It’s about wealth distribution | John Quiggin   Saying, for example, that last year we spent 22% less money in January than we did in December 2022 doesn’t tell us much other than that December 2022 included Christmas Day and January 2023 did not. So, the Australian Bureau of Statistics takes this into account by adjusting for seasonal factors (ie seasonally adjusted). But what happens if we change when and how we spend? It means the ABS has to adjust its seasonally adjusted measures. And this is not an exact science. Over the past 30 years our spending habits have changed quite markedly. Forty years ago we spent about 20% of our non-food (ie grocery) purchases in department stores, now it is just 9%:    If the graph does not display click here We have also changed the number of things we buy – in the 1980s 10% of the volume of non-food items we bought was household goods, now it is a quarter:    If the graph does not display click here The reason for this is due to changes in our habits, needs and the prices of items. To buy the amount of groceries that in 1984 cost $100, you would now need to spend $373. To dine in a restaurant and get the same meal that cost $100 in 1984, you are now looking at handing over $407; but if you want to buy the same amount of audio-visual or computing equipment that cost $100 in 1984, you would only need to pay $5.    If the graph does not display click here Similarly, the cost of household appliances and electrical goods have not gone up by much so we buy a lot more of them than we did in the past, even if we still spend about the same total share of our money on them as we did 40 years ago. When we buy things has also changed. In the 1980s, business for household goods retailers in December was equivalent to approximately 50 days of an “average” month; now it is worth less than 40. November has gone from being equivalent to 32–33 days of an average month to now being closer to 36:    If the graph does not display click here A big reason is those Black Friday sales that we have imported from the United States. Before the pandemic we used to spend about 8% more in November on non-food items than we did in October, but this year we spent 17% more:    If the graph does not display click here Are we doing that because we are all flush with cash? That question matters, because the RBA looks to retail trade figures to work out if we are spending too much and are thus, in their minds, fuelling inflation. If the boost in spending in October was mostly due to changes in habits rather than an indicator of our incomes, then the RBA should ignore it, especially given the latest monthly inflation figures out yesterday showed inflation dropped 4.3% in November – the lowest since January 2022:    If the graph does not display click here Will the RBA look at the retail figures and think Australians still have too much money to spend? Or will they see them for what they are – a sign Australians have become more accustomed to the Black Friday sales in November and are increasingly desperate to find a bargain to stretch their budgets as much as they can? On 6 February the RBA will let us know.  Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work "

        "content": "Sainsbury’s won shoppers from all its major grocery rivals this Christmas but sales at its Argos chain dived, in a worrying sign for high street rivals. The UK’s second-biggest supermarket reported an 8.6% rise in grocery sales in the six weeks to 6 January but Argos sales fell 4.2% in the same period as shoppers reined in spending on electrical goods and furniture. Demand for energy-saving gadgets such as electric blankets and air fryers was down after a surge in 2022 when fears about bills were at a peak, while shoppers bought fewer expensive items such as furniture because of cost of living pressures. Argos sales were strong over the Black Friday discount period in November but weakened in December when it was trading against a strong period a year earlier, when sales were helped by the Royal Mail strikes, which affected home deliveries by online specialists. In another sign of a tough non-food market, Sainsbury’s clothing sales were down 6% in the run-up to Christmas as the company said there had been lots of discounting in the market amid “big chunks” of mild weather. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, credited the group’s Nectar loyalty scheme discounts and price matching with Aldi on key items, as well as product innovation, with helping the chain take market share from the discounters and all its traditional rivals. Asda lost out the most to Sainsbury’s, followed by Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons, according to data from the market analysts Nielsen. “It was our first purple Christmas,” Roberts said, referring to the colour of its loyalty card. Responding to criticism that the scheme’s discounts, such as Nectar Prices – which Roberts said could save £18 on an £80 shop – were counteracted by charging other shoppers more, he said: “The evidence speaks for itself. Customers really bought into Nectar Prices with 18 million users last year.” Roberts said Sainsbury’s had increased the number of items sold because it had trimmed prices as inflation on food had eased, and claimed Sainsbury’s had increased the number of items sold faster than Aldi for the first time. “We have come a long way on our value position and that is why we have so many more shoppers coming to us,” the chief executive said. He said inflation on food would continue to ease but he did not expect deflation any time soon because – although some commodities had reduced in price – wage inflation would continue to mean higher costs on many items. Roberts said Sainsbury’s was working with the government to help reduce the impact of problems in the Red Sea caused by attacks by Houthi rebels on cargo ships. He said most shipments via the area were taking at least 10 days longer, as they could not go via the Suez Canal, and Sainsbury’s was carefully planning shipments to try to maintain availability and keep costs down. The company, which before Christmas promised it would hit the top end of market expectations on annual profits, maintained that guidance on Wednesday. However, the poor performance at Argos and lack of an upgrade led to an almost 5% fall in Sainsbury’s share price on Wednesday morning. Charlie Huggins at the investment firm Wealth Club, said: “Sainsbury’s cannot afford to rest on its laurels. The supermarket sector remains intensely competitive and the UK consumer is far from being out of the woods, with the weaker clothing and general merchandise sales pointing to an element of caution in consumer behaviour.”"

        "content": "A wave of artificial intelligence-driven misinformation and disinformation that could influence key looming elections poses the biggest short-term threat to the global economy, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has said. In a deeply gloomy assessment, the body that convenes its annual meeting in Davos next week expressed concern that politics could be disrupted by the spread of false information, potentially leading to riots, strikes and crackdowns on dissent from governments. The WEF’s annual risks report – which canvasses the opinion of 1,400 experts – found 30% of respondents thought there was a high risk of a global catastrophe over the next two years, with two-thirds fearful of a disastrous event within the next decade. The WEF said concerns over the persistent cost of living crisis and the intertwined risks of disinformation and polarised societies dominated the outlook for 2024. Elections are taking place this year in countries that represent 60% of global GDP, including Britain, the US, the EU and India, and the WEF said the nexus between falsified information and societal unrest would take centre stage during campaigns. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information, while disinformation is deliberately false content, which can be used to spread propaganda and sow fear and suspicion. Looking ahead over a longer 10-year period, extreme weather events and climate change were named as the most pressing risks by the experts polled by the WEF, which holds its annual meeting in Davos, a Swiss ski resort. “An unstable global order characterised by polarising narratives and insecurity, the worsening impacts of extreme weather and economic uncertainty are causing accelerating risks – including misinformation and disinformation – to propagate,” said Saadia Zahidi, a managing director of the WEF. “World leaders must come together to address short-term crises as well as lay the groundwork for a more resilient, sustainable, inclusive future.” The report – produced in partnership with Zurich Insurance and the professional services firm Marsh McLennan – ranks risks over a two-year and 10-year horizon. In the short-term, the five biggest risks are perceived to be misinformation and disinformation; extreme weather events; societal polarisation; cyber insecurity and interstate armed conflict. Carolina Klint, chief commercial officer in Europe for Marsh McLennan, said: “Artificial intelligence breakthroughs will radically disrupt the risk outlook for organisations with many struggling to react to threats arising from misinformation, disintermediation and strategic miscalculation. “It will take a relentless focus to build resilience at organisational, country and international levels – and greater cooperation between the public and private sectors – to navigate this rapidly evolving risk landscape.” Klint said AI magnified the threat of widespread use of disinformation and misinformation, which could result in the legitimacy of elected governments being questioned. Voters were likely to be targeted by hostile states and domestic actors, she added. In the longer term, the five top risks are identified as extreme weather events; critical change to earth systems; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; natural resource shortages; and misinformation and disinformation. Two-thirds of those polled were worried about extreme weather events in 2024, but there were differing views on the urgency of the risks posed. The report said private sector respondents believed that most environmental risks would materialise over a longer timeframe than civil society or government, pointing to the growing risk of getting past a point of no return. Zahidi said: “This is a very gloomy outlook but it is not a prediction of the future. The future is very much in our hands.”"

        "content": "The owner of South West Water, one of the UK utility firms fined for illegal sewage dumping last year, has bought Sutton and East Surrey (SES) Water in a deal worth £380m. Pennon, which also owns Bristol Water and Bournemouth Water, has confirmed the acquisition of the supplier, which has 745,000 customers across parts of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and south London. South West Water was one of a number of providers to be fined over illegal dumping of sewage last year after investigations by the Environment Agency. It was fined £2.15m in April over failures between July 2016 and August 2020 that led to harmful sewage being dumped by treatment works into rivers and seas in Devon and Cornwall. Across the 2022-23 period it spilled untreated sewage water 37,649 times. In May, Pennon’s chief executive, Susan Davy, who received a £522,000 bonus in 2022-23, was one of three UK water bosses to give up her bonus due to sewage performance.  SES Water was put up for sale by its owner, Sumisho Osaka Gas Water UK, nearly a year ago. Pennon will pay an initial purchase price of £89m for equity, with the total enterprise value, which includes the company’s equity and its debt, coming to £380m. The water provider, which is based in Redhill, Surrey, has 476 employees, who will transfer to Pennon after regulatory approvals. It is the FTSE 250 firm’s latest acquisition of a UK water company after it acquired Bristol Water in 2021, and Bournemouth Water in 2015. Pennon said the latest acquisition would be in addition to an £850m investment in its water businesses over the next two years, with the company planning £2.8bn in investment between 2025 and 2030. Pennon also announced plans for a £180m equity raise designed to keep its debt levels in line with existing targets following the deal. The company plans to offer the shares to both corporate and private retail investors at 61.05p each, with a minimum purchase set at £250 for each investor. SES customers will be given the chance to join Pennon’s WaterShare+ scheme, where customers are once a year offered the opportunity to become shareholders in the group. If they do not take the shares, they get the money off their next bill. Davy said: “SES Water is a fantastic growth opportunity for Pennon, demonstrating our commitment to the UK water industry. “As part of the Pennon Group, we will enhance SES Water’s financial resilience and better position the business to serve its customers and all stakeholders, as has proven to be the case with our acquisitions of Bournemouth Water and Bristol Water. “We are able to invest in SES Water’s resources infrastructure, environment and people thanks to our strong financial performance and long-term UK shareholder base, delivering a seamless transition for SES Water’s customers while also providing an even more robust and reliable service to customers.”"

        "content": "Greggs has hailed easing inflationary pressures after the UK’s biggest bakery chain rang up bumper Christmas sales amid less travel disruption and enthusiasm for seasonal specialities such as festive bakes and chocolate orange muffins. The company said sales at established stores had risen 9.4% in the three months to 30 December as it attracted more customers with extended opening hours and by offering online ordering. Better weather and fewer transport strikes than in the same period in 2022 also contributed to growth, the chain said, as did higher prices on some items – although at a lower rate than earlier in the year.   Related: UK shoppers spent £13.7bn on groceries in run-up to Christmas    Extending its ranges had also helped sales, it said, with festive bakes, chocolate orange muffins and Christmas lunch baguettes “in high demand”, while pizza sales continued to perform strongly. Greggs said it had increased prices by between 5p and 10p on a some items last month but had held down the cost of bestselling items such as sausage rolls. Roisin Currie, the chain’s chief executive, said the price rises were to help fund a pay increase for workers implemented this month, with store staff getting a 9.6% rise to at least £11.62 an hour, ahead of the new legal minimum wage of £11.44 from April for those 23 or older, but behind the independently verified living wage of £12. She said Greggs had “no plans” to increase prices across its ranges as it expected a more stable cost base over the year ahead. Currie added that any further price rises would be “minimal and would protect our value proposition”. The strong Christmas topped off a good year for the Newcastle-based business, with sales rising by almost 20% to £1.8bn in the year to 30 December as it bounced back with the return to high streets after the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to step up the pace of growth and open up to 160 shops in the year ahead, having opened a net 145 last year, taking the total to 2,473. Greggs shares rose 8.5% in early trading on Wednesday. Currie said: “I am proud of our teams, who did a fantastic job serving more customers as we continue to grow our shop estate and offer greater availability through digital channels and extended trading hours. “We enter 2024 with plans to continue to invest in our shops and expand supply chain capacity to deliver the growth strategy, supported by our strong balance sheet.” The company added in a statement that while wage inflation remains, “inflationary pressures are reducing and with good forward cover on food, packaging and energy we anticipate a more stable cost base in the coming year”. It added that while higher rates of pay added to the bakery chain’s costs, increased wages across the economy would also support shoppers’ incomes."

        "content": "A debt-ridden, leaking, polluting industry, owned largely by foreign investment firms, private equity and pension funds who have presided over decades of underinvestment most shockingly illustrated by the scale of raw sewage dumping into rivers: that is the privatised English water industry in 2024.  It is a global anomaly. Over the last three decades it has evolved into a notoriously complex system of shadow ownership that has loaded debt on to the balance sheet, while providing rich dividends for investors. Today, water as an industry is in varying levels of crisis. In the south-east, Thames Water, the biggest company, is riddled with debts of £18bn and struggling to extract the millions it needs from shareholders while its value plummets. At South East Water, the cost of servicing its debt has risen in six months by £7.4m to £54.8m as inflation and higher interest rates bite. Water companies across England are under criminal investigation into suspicions thousands of treatment works have been illegally dumping sewage into rivers for many years. Total dividends paid since 1989 have reached £83.7bn at today’s prices. Meanwhile, customers are being asked, via bill increases of up to 40%, to pay for required new investment of £96bn. Is there a solution for the water industry that will protect the environment, build in better accountability, provide clean drinking water and build resilience to climate change? We asked experts for their views. Ownership Dr Ewan McGaughey, a professor of law at King’s College London, argues England should join Scotland, Wales, Paris and most of the world, and restore public ownership using the legal framework of special administration that already exists. This can be triggered if companies are unlikely to be able to pay their debts without public subsidies or have seriously breached their duties, for example by failing to improve their pipes to stop leaks or failing to drain and clean sewers to stop pollution. Once in special administration, the companies can be transferred to a new publicly owned entity. Responding to the criticism that paying off shareholders and debts would cost too much, he argues the current law allows for debts to be reduced or even removed if they infringe on the water company’s ability to properly carry out its legal duties. Richard Murphy, of the Corporate Accountability Network and Sheffield University, argues the water companies are in effect environmentally insolvent because they do not have the financial means to raise the £260bn needed to stop their sewage dumping, according to a House of Lords assessment. Therefore no compensation is due to shareholders, or to those who lent money to the companies. But Murphy said in order to be pragmatic, a small offer to shareholders and a reasonable offer to secured creditors would be required to take the companies back into public control using the special administration rules. The cost of nationalisation would run into billions – all of which could be paid for by the issue of government bonds. To raise capital for the future of the publicly owned industry, the public could be offered the chance to buy a bond paying 4% or more in the long term to last for at least 70 years. For the first 15 years the return would be guaranteed by the government, encouraging the public to buy the bonds at scale and fund much of the required investment the industry needs over time. Dieter Helm, a professor of economic policy at Oxford University, says the privatised industry has “run into the sands” and what is required is systemic change focusing on sustainability, water conservation and a catchment system of regulation to tackle pollution at its source. Helm does not support re-nationalisation, but he does dismiss the often-repeated view that to take water back into public control would cost too much. “The one objection to nationalisation which has little merit is that it would cost the government a lot. This is nonsense,” says Helm. Re-nationalisation, he argues, would involve swapping the regulatory asset-based debt (RAB) for government bonds. “The government would gain the assets and the RABs and swap utility debt for Treasury debt,” he says. Regulation McGaughey says the rules that say the regulator, Ofwat, must secure reasonable returns for investors on their capital must be scrapped. Instead, a new social regulator should be set up with duties to ensure bill payers have clean water and sanitary services, communities have clean waterways and beaches, and all future surpluses are invested in upgrading infrastructure. Cat Hobbs, of campaign group We Own It, says the current regulatory system is consistently biased towards investors and the regulator is caught in an impossible bind to meet contradictory and contested interests of investors, end users and the state. The current law says companies need 25 years’ notice for the removal of their licence. “If you were starting from scratch, there’s no way you would start with the privatised system we have in England, geared towards shareholders with our rivers and seas coming as an afterthought. It’s simply not a sensible way to deliver what we need,” she said. What is required are publicly owned water companies with a duty to work with communities to clean up and protect our rivers and seas, she said. Governance structures and regulatory mechanisms must hold them accountable as in countries like Scotland and France. Sustainability Population increases, climate change-induced droughts and increases in water demand from data centres mean the pressure on the water system will only rise over the coming decades. A large facility might use anywhere between 4m and 19m litres of water a day for cooling. Without further action there is a one in four chance over the next 30 years that large numbers of households will have their water supply cut off for an extended period because of a severe drought, according to the National Infrastructure Commission. There is a need for more water, but also to reduce water use – currently the average person in England and Wales used 146 litres of water a day. The government wants to cut this to 110 litres a day by 2030. In that context, using drinking water to flush toilets and wash our faces is seen as costly and unsustainable. Helm argues for separation of the system of drinking and wastewater, something dismissed by the government as too expensive – an argument Helm rejects. He argues instead that separation can be done gradually and grey water can be recycled at the household level with localised urban networks built into the system. “At the moment, everyone has access to drinking-water-quality supplies for everything, including watering the garden, cleaning the car and to cool [computing] data hubs,” says Helm.  “Imagine if drinking water was for drinking and related uses only, and its use was metered with volume-related charges. “Imagine a world where drinking water was separated from grey water … [and] new houses [had] a water efficiency requirement to store water … [There would be] strong incentives [for] all houses to store water and recycle for gardening and other non-drinking water use because the metered price was high and reflected scarcity over different periods. “It could eventually be real-time pricing … in this imaginary world there would not be a scarcity of water supplies.”"

        "content": "The baby milk seller Danone has agreed to cut the wholesale price of its Aptamil infant powdered formula by 7% from Monday after the UK’s competition watchdog launched an investigation into high inflation in the market. The French company, which also owns the Cow & Gate brand, accounts for 71% of the baby formula market in the UK, where manufacturers have been found by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to have raised prices by 25% in two years. The price of an 800g pack of Danone’s Aptamil formula went up 26% to about £14.50 between March 2021 and April 2023. The same size pack of Cow & Gate 1 rose 31% according to data compiled by the public health nutrition charity First Steps Nutrition Trust (FSNT). Danone’s 7% price cut applies to all its powdered Aptamil formulas sold to UK retailers but not liquid baby milks or any of its Cow & Gate products. Its decision to partly reverse its price rises is likely to put pressure on other major manufacturers to follow suit, including Nestlé, which owns the SMA and Little Steps brands and accounts for about 14% of the UK market. The CMA launched an investigation late last year saying it was concerned that baby formula was vulnerable to higher-than-inflation price rises as parents were nervous of switching brands and only one supermarket own-label alternative existed – from the cut-price chain Aldi. The watchdog found those who do switch brands could save as much as £500 a year by doing so. It added that annual costs could also be being pushed up by manufacturers’ feeding volume guides, which were “systematically higher” than those recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. The supermarket Iceland said it would be cutting the price of three 800g Aptamil powders it sold from £12 to £11.20. Richard Walker, the executive chairman of the retailer’s parent group,  hit out last month at what he called the “exploitation” of new parents, joining the FSNT in calling for a cap on baby formula prices. He welcomed Danone’s move to reduce the price of Aptamil across the market, adding: “While we support breastfeeding as the most beneficial way of feeding infants, the millions of families who rely on formula need more support for their choice or circumstances and simply reducing the price won’t solve the systemic issues we’ve drawn attention to.” Walker wants changes to the law to allow retailers to promote discounted formula and to allow shoppers to buy it with loyalty points, gift cards or food bank vouchers. The FSNT has called for a price cap and a public health campaign that would highlight the nutritional equivalence of all first infant formula, the contents of which is strictly regulated no matter the price or brand. It also wants better enforcement of legislation designed to prevent inappropriate marketing of formula milks. Brands currently get around the limits on advertising infant formula by promoting “follow-on milk” – a type of formula targeted at toddlers who do not need a special drink to remain healthy. A Danone UK spokesperson said: “We recognise the challenges faced by parents due to inflation. During this difficult period, we have worked very hard to absorb the significant cost increases we have faced, make savings, and minimise any price increases.” The company said it would continue to engage with the CMA over the coming months adding: “In Danone’s experience the formula milks market is competitive.”"

        "content": "Australia’s inflation rate slowed in November, reinforcing expectations the Reserve Bank’s key interest rate has peaked. The headline consumer price index for the month was 4.3%, down from October’s 4.9%. It shows prices were rising at their slowest pace since the 4.0% reported in January 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had forecast November’s CPI to be 4.4%. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, welcomed the drop, while adding that inflation was “still higher than we would like”. Labor’s policies were “helping to put downward pressure on inflation but we know that there’s more work to do because people are still under pressure”, he said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Michelle Marquardt, the head of prices statistics at the ABS, said housing costs continued to rise, up 6.6% from a year ago, while food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 4.6%, and insurance and financial services were 8.8% more expensive. Excluding volatile items from the monthly CPI indicator, the annual rise in November was 4.8% – lower than the annual rise of 5.1% in October, she said. The annual trimmed mean, another inflation measure that the RBA monitors closely, also slid to 4.6%, or well down on annual rates of 5.4% and 5.3% for September and October, respectively. The monthly headline inflation figures offer only a partial snapshot of price pressures compared with the December quarter numbers, which are due out on 31 January. But they provide more proof that inflation is continuing to wane, as intended by the RBA’s 13 increases in its cash rate since May 2022, the fastest in three decades. In the lead-up to today’s release, investors were rating the chance of a 14th rate hike as less than 10%, according to the ASX rates tracker. Investors were fully pricing in a 25 basis-points rate cut to 4.1% as the next move by the RBA by September.  CPI in November was 4.3%, or the lowest since January 2022. (Source: @ABSStats ) pic.twitter.com/JhSPe2O00i— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) January 10, 2024  Australia’s monthly headline inflation rate peaked at 8.4% in December 2022 and has mostly trended lower since then. The November data has a greater weighting on services compared with October. On a quarterly basis, the rate of goods price increases has been falling for a year while service inflation only started retreating in the September quarter of 2023. The market’s initial reaction to the inflation numbers was limited. Stocks were 0.2% down for the day. The Australian dollar ticked about 0.1 US cent higher to be worth 66.95 US cents. “My base case view remains that the quarterly CPI won’t be bad enough to lead the RBA to revise up its current inflation forecasts,” said David Bassanese, chief economist for BetaShares, adding: “Hence the RBA is likely to leave rates on hold in February – and has likely finished raising rates.” Among housing costs, rents rose at an annual rate of 7.1% in November, faster than the 6.6% reported in October. Without the changes to the commonwealth rent assistance from 20 September, rents would have risen 8.8% over the 12 months to November, the ABS said. Electricity prices, too, were 10.7% higher than a year earlier, up from a year-on-year increase of 10.1% for October. Gas prices were up 12.9%, similar to the annual rate for October.   Related: Australia’s cost-of-living crisis isn’t about the price of groceries. It’s about wealth distribution | John Quiggin   Without the government’s energy bill relief fund, the increase in power prices would have been 19% since June instead of the 8.8% increase, the ABS said. There was better news for motorists: automotive fuel was 2.3% higher than in November, which was a much smaller increase than the 8.6% pace in October and the eye-watering 19.7% in September. The easing of the pain at the bowser was “a significant contributor to the lower annual rise in the monthly CPI indicator over the past two months”, Marquardt said. Meat and seafood posted one of the smallest increases, with prices up 0.2% from November 2022. Farmers and some politicians, though, have argued that retail prices for meat should be decreasing after wholesale prices fell sharply as farms started destocking towards the end of 2023. Holiday travel and accommodation posted a 0.3% fall in prices, as did furnishing, household equipment and services, the only two groups to be cheaper than a year earlier. Rising weather disaster costs contributed to higher insurance costs, with premiums up 16.3% in November from a year ago. That increase was the fastest since the ABS began compiling monthly CPI figures, and compared with 14.7% in October. Other relatively positive news out Wednesday included job vacancies totalled 389,000 in November. The tally was down about 1%, or 3,000, from August. However, the decline was much smaller than the 8% pace recorded in August. The number of job openings also remain 71% higher than the pre-Covid level in February 2020, with the ratio of those looking for work compared with vacancies halving over that time to 1.5, the ABS said. November retail sales figures released on Monday showed consumers spent more than expected in a month boosted by major discounting events, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Turnover rose 2% for the month, better than the economists’ tip of 1.2%, although spending remained just 2.2% higher than a year earlier, which was a contraction once inflation is accounted for. Building approvals for the month were also better than forecast, expanding 1.6% for the month alone to just over 14,500. Economists had predicted a slight fall after approvals rose 7.2% and the RBA had lifted the cash rate again that month."

        "content": "Boeing must acknowledge “our mistake”, its CEO has said, after the cabin panel of a 737 Max 9 jet blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight last week. Dozens of Max 9 planes have been grounded following the incident, awaiting inspection amid heightened concerns around safety. Alaska and United Airlines have since both found loose parts on several jets. Regulators have stressed that passenger safety, “not speed”, will determine how soon they return to the skies. “We’re going to approach this – number one – acknowledging our mistake,” Dave Calhoun told Boeing employees at an all-hands meeting at its factory in Renton, Washington, where 737s are assembled, on Tuesday. “We’re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way.”   Related: Airlines United and Alaska find loose bolts on Boeing 737 Max 9 planes   He described his own reaction to a picture of Friday’s Alaska Airlines airlines flight showing the missing section of the fuselage, and his concern that someone could have been in the adjacent seat. It was, as it happened, empty. “I’ve got kids, I’ve got grandkids, and so do you,” Calhoun said, according to a transcript shared by Boeing. “This stuff matters. Every detail matters.” The plane maker’s response to the fallout from its latest crisis contrasts starkly to how it initially responded to the crashes of two Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. It spent months largely failing to acknowledge blame, and a congressional report blamed a “culture of concealment” for the fatal crashes. The company later said it would have made a different decision “if we could go back”. Boeing has yet to finalise a set of instructions for inspections and maintenance of the grounded Max 9 jets with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The group submitted an “initial version” which is now being revised following feedback, according to the agency, which pledged to conduct a “thorough review” of its plan. “Every Boeing 737-9 Max with a plug door will remain grounded until the FAA finds each can safely return to operation,” the FAA said in a statement issued shortly before Calhoun was due to address employees. “The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning the Boeing 737-9 Max to service.” Boeing said: “We continue to be in close contact with our customers and the FAA on the required inspections. As part of the process, we are making updates based on their feedback and requirements.” The FAA grounded 171 Max 9 jets over the weekend to allow for inspections. On Friday, a cabin panel blew out of a new Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9, shortly after it had taken off from Portland, Oregon, forcing an emergency landing. No serious injuries were reported. A chunk of the fuselage was recovered from an Oregon teacher’s backyard. Ahead of the internal meeting, Calhoun stressed the need for Boeing to reinforce “our focus on and our commitment to safety, quality, integrity and transparency. Boeing revealed on Tuesday that it delivered 528 planes in total last year, ramping up from 480 in 2022. It also booked 1,314 net new orders, from 774 the previous year. The FAA is also facing scrutiny. Reuters reported that the regulator’s new head, Mike Whitaker, is set to appear before Congress next month, on 6 February, amid questions over its oversight of Boeing. JD Vance, the Republican senator, said: “The FAA has assured me the 737 Max is safe – last week’s near catastrophe calls that determination into question.” Vance argued that the Senate’s commerce committee should schedule a hearing to evaluate incidents involving the Max, as well as the FAA’s supervision, “as soon as possible”. Shares in Boeing, which fell sharply on Monday following concern over the safety of the 737 Max 9, declined further on Tuesday."

        "content": "Gas drilling at a site in the Surrey Hills can go ahead after the court of appeal ruled that no further attempts to stop the project could be brought to court. The Loxley site, just outside the village of Dunsfold, has been at the centre of a protracted legal battle over plans by the energy company UK Oil and Gas (Ukog) to sink an exploration well. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has faced criticism after being accused of not sufficiently opposing the scheme since taking his cabinet position. Before becoming chancellor, Hunt had previously said the drilling would “create enormous disruption and environmental damage for little if any economic benefit”, and attended protests against the scheme. However, since being appointed to cabinet he has remained quiet. A source close to Hunt said he could not comment on cases subject to judicial review as a government minister, but that his views on the project as a constituency MP are a matter of public record. After the decision, Hunt tweeted: “I am bitterly disappointed to learn that the court of appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the Ukog planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold. I stand ready to provide my assistance and support to local communities in any way possible going forwards.”  Hunt is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats in his South West Surrey constituency, where he has a majority of 8,000. The local environmental issue has angered many of his constituents, who have complained about the noise and environmental impacts of drilling for gas near the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty. The Liberal Democrats environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: “This is a shameful outcome. This Conservative government’s policies have resulted in greedy gas barons ripping up the Surrey Hills. They have railroaded this through the courts despite local outrage at the plans. “Surrey’s green land is about to be torn up, proving you simply can’t trust the Conservatives on the environment. As the local MP, Jeremy Hunt must now intervene. He is supporting a policy which will allow his constituency to become an oilfield. Local people will be furious at his silence.” Stephen Sanderson, Ukog’s chief executive, said: “We are pleased that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has once again dismissed the legal challenge to our Loxley project and has confirmed that its planning consent is entirely lawful, as the company and its counsel has maintained. We believe that a successful project will be beneficial to local and national level energy and economic interests and is fully in keeping with the government’s hydrogen, energy security and net zero strategies.”"

The struggling online retailer is consulting with up to 100 workers at the site just two years after it was opened to great fanfare with the intention of using it for “supplier learning and development”, creating 170 jobs. At least some of those roles are understood to be linked to manufacturing. Staff working on quality assurance and ethical compliance that are also based there are expected to be moved to another site in Leicester, in the change, which was first reported by Drapers trade journal. A spokesperson for Boohoo Group, which owns the Debenhams, Pretty Little Thing, Oasis and Burton brands as well as its main label, said: “We opened Thurmaston Lane in January 2022 to support [Boohoo] in several ways, including manufacturing, printing and training.

It is currently developing ‘AIO-001’, a treatment for asthma which is ready to enter mid-stage clinical trials.     3.16pm GMT   Bond trading giant PIMCO has published its latest economic outlook for the next six to 12 months today. PIMCO warns that the economic resilience of 2023 will give way to stagnation in 2024, and that recession risks are elevated – even though central banks are trying to achieve a soft landing. They warn that central banks could cut rates more aggressively than the markets expect, and point out that the UK and Europe are more interest-rate-sensitive than the US, and are also vulnerable to weak growth in China. Here are the key points:  After major economies showed surprising resilience in 2023, we anticipate a downshift toward stagnation or mild contraction in 2024. The standout strength of the U.S. is likely to fade over our six- to 12-month cyclical horizon. After a rally across many financial markets in late 2023, riskier assets appear priced for an economic soft landing and may be underestimating both upside and downside risks. With attractive valuations and yields still near 15-year highs, fixed income markets can offer an array of opportunities with the potential to weather multiple macroeconomic scenarios. In credit markets, we continue to favor U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other high quality assets backed by collateral, which offer both attractive yields and downside resiliency. We expect to be broadly neutral on duration after the most recent bond-market rally, which has brought global yields back in line with our expected ranges, and amid the shifting balance of inflation and growth risks.

The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 269 points, or 0.7%, down to 37,413 points. Boeing is the top faller, down 1.8%, as the crisis at the aeroplane-maker continues. Overnight, both Alaska Airlines and United reported they had found loose parts on multiple Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, following the mid-air blowout of a door plug on one flight last Friday. 27 of the 30 stocks on the Dow are in the red, as investors continue to fret that interest rates may not be cut as quickly as hoped. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, explains:  Attention remains on inflation data, which is due later this week and will offer further clues about the Federal Reserve’s path for interest rates. Federal Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, a voting member this year, said he sees the first cut in the third quarter and leans towards keeping rates high while inflation is above 2%. His hawkish comments have weighed on stocks and boosted the US dollar.   Updated at 2.57pm GMT    2.33pm GMT  World economy facing \"weakest half-decade of growth in 30 years\"  Newsflash: the World Bank has warned that the global economy is set to slow for a third successive year in 2024 and is now on course for its weakest half-decade of growth since the early 1990s. The Washington-based organisation said poor countries were being especially hard hit by a series of setbacks since the arrival of the Covid pandemic and there was a risk that the 2020s would be a “wasted” decade. The Bank’s half-yearly global economic prospects (GEP) – which concentrates primarily on the performance of developing and low-income countries – found an uneven picture in the recovery period since much of the world was shut down in 2020. Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist, said by the end of 2024 all developed economies would have higher income per head than before the pandemic, as against two-thirds of low income countries and less than half of fragile or conflict countries. “Without a major course correction, the 2020s will go down as a decade of wasted opportunity,” Gill said, adding:  “Near-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries – especially the poorest – stuck in a trap: with paralysing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people. That would obstruct progress on many global priorities.”  More here.

In fact, a British government bond auction today has attracted the strongest demand since April 2020. The sale of £2.25bn of UK 20-year bonds attracted bids for 3.62 times the volume of gilts on offer. Reuters says makes this the most over-subscribed auction since a sale of 20-year gilts early in the pandemic, when investors were very keen to buy safe assets. High demand is good news for the government, as it can choose the most attractive bids on offer. The 2043 gilt sold at an average yield of 4.391%.

The list of top global leaders attending Davos next week for the World Economic Forum has just been released. France’s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar will be rubbing shoulders at the ski resort with China’s premier Li Qiang, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Argentina’s new leader Javier Milei. However, Rishi Sunak is not on the list, suggesting the UK PM could be planning to swerve Davos again (as he did last year too). The theme of this year’s Davos is “Rebuilding Trust”, but the event will be overshadowed by conflict in the Middle East, as well as in Ukraine. Several Middle Eastern leaders will attend, including Israel’s president Isaac Herzog, Qatar’s PM Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan’s PM Bisher Hani Al Khasawneh, Iraq’s Mohammed Shyaa Al Sudani and Lebanon’s Najib Mikati. The US delegation will include Antony Blinken, US Secretary of State; Jake Sullivan, US National Security Adviser, plus representatives from the Senate and House of Representatives. WEF say that more than 60 heads of state and government are expected, including:  Li Qiang, Premier of the People’s Republic of China; Emmanuel Macron, President of France; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Javier Milei, President of Argentina; Han Duck-soo, Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea; Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain; Viola Amherd, President of the Swiss Confederation 2024 and Federal Councillor of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports; Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine; Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium; Gustavo Francisco Petro Urrego, President of Colombia; Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece; Mohammed Shyaa Al Sudani, Prime Minister of Iraq; Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach of Ireland; Bisher Hani Al Khasawneh, Prime Minister of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; William Samoei Ruto, President of Kenya; Najib Mikati, President of the Council of Ministers of Lebanon; Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, Prime Minister of Mongolia; Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands; Bola Ahmed Tinubu, President of Nigeria; Andrzej Duda, President of Poland; Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar; Aleksandar Vučić, President of Serbia; Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of Singapore; Ranil Wickremesinghe, President of Sri Lanka; Isaac Herzog, President of the State of Israel; Srettha Thavisin, Prime Minister of Thailand; Pham Minh Chinh, Prime Minister of Vietnam.      12.57pm GMT  Sky News: Chancellor holds talks with City chiefs  Jeremy Hunt had reportedly held talks with some of the City’s top business leaders this morning, in a bid to inject fresh momentum into London’s stock market, and encourage more firms to float here. According to Sky News, the chief executives of asset managers Abrdn and Schroders and their counterpart at HSBC Holdings were among those scheduled to attend a breakfast summit with the chancellor. Sky says:  City sources said the objective of the meeting was to review existing initiatives aimed at boosting the competitiveness of UK equity capital markets following the Mansion House reforms unveiled last year by Mr Hunt. Among the measures he announced last summer was a move to liberalise the rules governing the spectrum of assets in which pension funds can invest.

Vivek Paul, BlackRock’s UK chief investment strategist, told Bloomberg that UK bonds could come under pressure if voters are promised looser fiscal policy – such as lower taxes. Paul said:  “As inflation falls in the UK and we get closer to the general election date, major UK political parties may be more tempted to promise looser fiscal policy — the more this occurs, the greater the likelihood of the return of the bond vigilantes.” “In the lead-up to this year’s UK election, we’re watching the fiscal policy stance.”  The Conservative party appear keen to fight the next election on the issue of tax; last weekend, Rishi Sunak said he wants to cut taxes for working people further this year, possibly cutting welfare payments to fund it.   Related: Sunak says he wants to reduce workers’ taxes this year and may cut benefits   Tax cuts could also be ‘funded’ by cutting investment, although that would be a short-sighted strategy. Alternatively, lower taxes could lead to higher borrowing to cover the gap between the government’s income and spending. Increased borrowing needs could push down bond prices, increasing the yield (or interest rate) on the debt, as investors demand a higher rate of return for buying UK debt. The UK got a taste of this in September 2022, when the markets balked at the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget, sending bond yields soaring.

Peter Vanden Houte, ING’s chief economist for the eurozone, points out that the eurozone’s labour market remains historically tight. Following this morning’s drop in eurozone unemployment to a joint record low, Vanden Houte explains:  Although the eurozone has been going through a soft patch with year-on-year GDP growth in the third quarter, and likely also in the fourth quarter, close to zero, this has not had any impact on the unemployment rate, which has fallen over the year. There have been several explanations for this. The economic weakness has been predominantly in the manufacturing sector, while the more labour-intensive services sector has fared better. On top of that, there has been a preference for shorter work hours, negatively affecting productivity growth per employee and exacerbating the demographically-induced tightness in the labour market.   Eurozone GDP was virtually stagnant over the year to Q3 2023, yet the eurozone unemployment rate fell to a new historic low of 6.4% in November, writes @pvandenhoutehttps://t.co/E2PnweGa2Q— ING Economics (@ING_Economics) January 9, 2024      11.35am GMT  GMB: Workers at Amazon's new Birmingham warehouse to strike  Back in the UK, the GMB union has announced that workers at Amazon’s new flagship warehouse in Birmingham have voted to join industrial action, just weeks after opening.

The order book deflation of the last two years leaves clear marks as well as ongoing energy and policy uncertainty. With a soft or hard landing of the US economy and still very little positive growth momentum in China, external demand for German industrial production is likely to remain weak. The only upside could come from a turning of the inventory cycle. However, even though there are some very tentative signs of inventory reduction, it would still take until late spring before we could see a significant impact on actual production.  Brzeski also fears that December is likely to bring more negative surprises, with the first signs of economic fallout from the government’s fiscal woes, disruptions in the Suez Canal and reportedly weak Christmas sales.  He adds:  All of this points to another small contraction in the fourth quarter, pushing the German economy into the first – admittedly very minor – technical recession since 2020.      9.50am GMT   Hays has been hit by a recruitment slowdown in both the UK and globally, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. And that is a concerning economic signal, Mould explains, after this morning’s warning that profits will be below expectations.  “Recruitment stocks are often a good harbinger for the wider economy as companies are keen to hire when they’re feeling confident and tend to freeze recruitment when times are more uncertain. “In this sense a profit warning from Hays has wider significance. The speed of the deterioration in its outlook will be cause for particular concern. “The company’s problems look particularly acute in the UK – but with fees as a whole down 10% for the quarter and down an alarming 15% for December, this is a global issue too. “Hays is cutting its own cloth accordingly and as a cyclical business it is used to dealing with fluctuating fortunes. “The company may have to batten down the hatches for some time, but it will hope a pivot in interest rates and a reduction in inflationary pressures will eventually lead to an improvement in business confidence and help drive a recovery in hiring activity. “While this is out of the company’s control, levers it can pull include expanding its ‘enterprise client’ business which sees firms outsource their temporary and permanent white-collar recruitment to Hays. This could help increase the predictability of earnings.”      9.17am GMT  B&M doesn't expect material impact from Suez Canal disruption  B&M says it doesn’t expect any material impact from disruption to shipments through the Suez Canal, despite attacks by Houthi militants forcing some shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea.

B&M’s UK like-for-like revenues rose by 3.7% in the 13 weeks from 24 September to 23 December, rather slower than in France where they grew by 11.3%, while its Heron Foods business grew by 11.7%. Alex Russo, chief executive, said,  “The performance across the Golden Quarter has been pleasing, with strong operational execution across the three businesses.  Our strategy remains unchanged - we are an everyday low-price discounter with a laser-focus in keeping excellence in retail standards and our costs the lowest.  This allows us to provide our products at the best price to all customers – many of whom continue to face significant cost-of-living pressures.  B&M has also announced a special dividend of 20p per share for investors. But despite this sweetener, its shares have dropped 0.6% this morning. Emma Carr, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says:  Despite a slowing in midway-year growth for this discount retailer, its last minute rebound in sales can doubtless be attributed to a rush in last-minute festive sales requirements where the retailer was able to step in and rapidly meet these needs. Of course, capitalising on this as we move into the New Year period will be key for the retailer, as it looks to utilise its traditionally well-focused supply chain capabilities to deliver against the fortunes of other more mainstream supermarket competitors.      8.29am GMT  Hays shares slide after hiring slowdown warning  Shares in Hays are down 12% in early trading in London, after it warned that the fall in fees will hits its profits. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says:  “Hays has issued a profit warning – it expects first half pre-exceptional operating profit of about £60 million, missing analysts’ expectations, sending shares sharply lower. In its second quarter trading statement it also said quarterly fees fell by 10%, hurt by weakness in December. But the recruiter said it is too early to tell whether this reflects a more sustained market slowdown. Shares in Hays plunged as much as 19% at one stage this morning and are still down by over 12%. Hiring of permanent staff tends to ebb and flow with the economic cycle. The sluggish global growth backdrop combined with tighter monetary policy has dampened business appetite to pile on additional fixed staffing costs. And while temporary workers typically pick up the slack, Hays said it didn’t see the ‘normal seasonal step-up in worker volumes’ dealing a double blow to the recruitment firm. Today’s slide reverses much of the rebound in the stock seen since the lows in October. Over a 12-month period shares are down by over a fifth.”   Updated at 8.29am GMT    8.02am GMT   Here’s a full breakdown of Hays’ trading in the last quarter of 2023, showing the “clear slowdown” in global markets:  Germany: flat fees, or up 2% on a WDA basis.

December has been a cruel month for UK recruiters, and retailers. Hays, the global recruitment consultants, has reported that its fees – earned by placing candidates into roles) – fell by 15% last month, as demand from companies looking to fill vacancies slowed. This led to a 10% drop in earnings across the last quarter, and the slowdown means Hays expects to miss market expectations for profits in the first half of its financial year. The company is now accelerating its cost reduction and efficiency programmes, and cut its consultant headcount by 5% in the October-December quarter. In the UK & Ireland, Hays reports that fees fell 17% in the last quarter, including a 13% drop in income from temporary positions and a 21% drop in permanent fees. The slowdown went further too, with Australia & New Zealand fees down 20%, Asia down 11%, and the Americas down 25%. Dirk Hahn, Hays chief executive, says it is “too early to say” if December’s weakness shows a sustained market slowdown, or rather that some placements are simply being deferred. But, Hahn warns, near-term market conditions are expected to remain challenging, citing increased uncertainties and reduced client and candidate confidence. He told shareholders:  “Overall market conditions became increasingly challenging through the quarter, including a clear slowdown in most markets in December, notably in our Perm businesses as client and candidate decision-making slowed. Temp volumes remained broadly stable sequentially through the quarter, but declined YoY as we did not see our normal seasonal step-up in worker volumes. As a result, we expect operating profit in our first half to be c.£60 million, despite our ongoing actions to reduce costs.  UK shoppers also cut back last month, leaving retailers suffering a disappointing festive period, new data this morning shows. Total sales grew 1.7% in December, down from almost 7% growth a year earlier, the British Retail Consortium and consultancy KPMG have reported. Their report shows there was a slight increase spending in the week leading up to Christmas as consumers scrambled to purchase last-minute gifts. But shoppers shunned clothing, jewellery and technology gifts, opting instead for beauty, health and personal care products, while toys and gaming also sold well. And households remained cautious about making larger purchases in the post-Christmas sales. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, says:  “The festive period failed to make amends for a challenging year of sluggish retail sales growth. “Weak consumer confidence continued to hold back spending.”    Related: Festive retail sales struggle as Britons spend more on going out and holidays   Also coming up today Boeing is facing an escalating crisis after loose parts were discovered on some grounded 737 Max jets, days after an Alaska Airlines plane suffered a mid-air blowout on Friday.

        "content": "The fast fashion company Boohoo is considering closing a factory that it set up in Leicester as a model for its efforts to improve the treatment of workers making its clothing. The struggling online retailer is consulting with up to 100 workers at the site two years after it was opened to great fanfare with the intention of using it for “supplier learning and development”, creating 170 jobs. At least some of those roles are understood to be linked to manufacturing. Staff working on quality assurance and ethical compliance that are also based there are expected to be moved to another site in Leicester, in the change, which was first reported by the trade journal Drapers. A spokesperson for Boohoo Group, which owns the Debenhams, Pretty Little Thing, Oasis and Burton brands as well as its main label, said: “We opened Thurmaston Lane in January 2022 to support [Boohoo] in several ways, including manufacturing, printing and training. “As in any retail business the role of our sites continues to evolve over time and following significant investments at our Sheffield distribution centre and the opening of new distribution centre in the USA, we must now take steps to continue to ensure we are a more efficient, productive and strengthened business. “All these factors have led us to make the difficult decision to consider relocating some of the operations at Thurmaston Lane and consider the closure of the site in due course. “We are now in a period of consultation and are working closely with all affected colleagues to ensure they are fully supported during this process.” Operations at the factory in Thurmaston Lane were highlighted as a model by the retired judge Sir Brian Leveson in a review conducted as part of Boohoo’s Agenda for Change roadmap in 2020. The plan intended to improve conditions in the fast fashion group’s supply chain after revelations about poor pay and conditions, particularly at locations in Leicester where the group then sourced about 40% of its fashions. However, the Thurmaston site has been the subject of controversy, after a BBC Panorama investigation last November revealed that some orders placed via the factory were actually being made by facilities in Morocco and elsewhere in Leicester. Dominique Muller, whose report on Leicester factories in lockdown for the campaign group Labour Behind the Label prompted the concerns about Boohoo, said the potential closure of the model factory was disappointing. “When the factory was announced it heralded such promise and the agenda for change was full of hope. But what has actually changed? UK factories are really struggling and workers are getting the worst of that.” Boohoo’s commitment to manufacturing in the UK has also diminished. In 2022 it sourced only 25% of its products in the UK and that had fallen to 20% last year. The potential closure of the Leicester model factory comes after a tough year for the company, with fears about imminent festive sales figures as households appear to have cut back on clothing spending over the Christmas period. In October, Boohoo said it expected annual sales to fall by between 12% and 17%, a dive from the maximum 5% drop previously forecast, as analysts said the group had lost market share despite price cuts. Boohoo’s sales are shrinking after a boom during the coronavirus pandemic, when stores on high streets and in shopping centres were forced to close for many months. Sales fell 17% to £729m in the six months to 31 August, forcing the company £11m further into the red than a year before – to a loss of £26.4m."

        "content": "The global economy is set to slow for a third successive year in 2024 and is now on course for its weakest half-decade of growth since the early 1990s, the World Bank has warned. The Washington-based organisation said poor countries were being especially hard hit by a series of setbacks since the arrival of the Covid pandemic and there was a risk that the 2020s would be a “wasted” decade. The Bank’s half-yearly global economic prospects (GEP) – which concentrates primarily on the performance of developing and low-income countries – found an uneven picture in the recovery period since much of the world was shut down in 2020. Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist, said by the end of 2024 all developed economies would have higher income per head than before the pandemic, as against two-thirds of low income countries and less than half of fragile or conflict countries. “Without a major course correction, the 2020s will go down as a decade of wasted opportunity,” Gill said. “Near-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries – especially the poorest – stuck in a trap: with paralysing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people. That would obstruct progress on many global priorities.”  Interactive  After growing by 6% as the global economy opened up in 2021, the Bank said the rate of expansion had eased back to 3% in 2022 and to an estimated 2.6% in 2023. It has pencilled in growth of 2.3% in 2024, with advanced economies growing by 1.2% and emerging market and developing economies expanding by 3.9%. Gill said it was vital for poor countries to increase investment and that urgent action to ease their debt burdens would help them do so. Having been billed as a “transformative decade” that would see major progress towards delivering a zero carbon global economy and achieving the UN’s 2030 development goals, Gill said catch-up work was now required. “Opportunities still exist to turn the tide”, he said. “This report offers a clear way forward: it spells out the transformation that can be achieved if governments act now to accelerate investment and strengthen fiscal policy frameworks.” To tackle the climate change and achieve other key global development goals by 2030, the Bank estimates developing countries will need to deliver a “formidable” increase in investment of around $2.4tn per year. “Without a comprehensive policy package, prospects for such an increase are not bright. Per capita investment growth in developing economies between 2023 and 2024 is expected to average only 3.7%, just over half the rate of the previous two decades,” it said. The Bank said one risk to its forecast was an intensification of the war between Russia and Ukraine or the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza leading to a wider Middle East crisis. “Recent attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea have already started to disrupt key shipping routes, eroding slack in supply networks and increasing the likelihood of inflationary bottlenecks. In a setting of escalating conflicts, energy supplies could also be substantially disrupted, leading to a spike in energy prices,” the GEP said. “This would have significant spillovers to other commodity prices and heighten geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which in turn could dampen investment and lead to a further weakening of growth.” "

        "content": "EDF is planning to extend the life of four nuclear power stations in the UK and increase investment in its British nuclear fleet. The French energy company, which manages Britain’s eight nuclear power stations, said it would make a decision on whether to extend the life of the four plants with advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) – Torness, Heysham 1 and 2, and Hartlepool – by the end of the year. This would require regulatory approval. A spokesperson for the company said it would depend on plant inspections, adding the extensions would not be long but “incremental”.   Related: Sellafield nuclear safety and security director to leave    Last March, EDF extended lifetimes at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 by a further two years to March 2026. Heysham 2 and Torness power stations are now due to stay operational until March 2028. The French state-owned firm is also looking into running its Sizewell B plant on the Suffolk coast for 20 years longer than scheduled, until 2055. It is the UK’s only pressurised water reactor plant and has a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts (GW). A final decision will be taken next year. EDF said it would invest a further £1.3bn in its whole UK nuclear fleet, which employs 5,000 people, between 2024 and 2026, taking the total invested to nearly £9bn since 2009. It plans to hire more than 1,000 people at its UK nuclear operations this year. Mark Hartley, the managing director of EDF’s nuclear operations business, said: “Looking ahead, our aim is to maintain the output of the four AGR stations for as long as possible and extend Sizewell B by a further 20 years out to 2055.” EDF Energy, its UK arm, operates Britain’s five nuclear power stations that generate electricity. A further three are defuelling (Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B and Dungeness B), the first stage of decommissioning. The output of EDF’s UK nuclear fleet was 37.3 terawatt hours (TWh) last year, 15% lower than the year before because of station closures and statutory outages. The company aims to maintain output at 2023 levels until at least 2026. EDF will also build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast. A legal challenge brought by a campaign group against the government’s decision to build the 3.2GW plant was rejected last summer. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “EDF’s … ambition to extend the four AGR stations further if possible, should be widely welcomed – as it will cut gas imports, cut carbon and relieve winter pressures on our shaky grid. “While lifetime extensions will help in the short term, they won’t address the medium and long-term issues of a fleet getting close to retirement – what we now need is for the government to get Sizewell C to a final investment decision swiftly, and set out a plan for a new fleet of stations.” France’s energy minister said last week that the country needs more than the six new nuclear power stations that it has planned and may need to build 14 new plants in total. They will be built and operated by EDF."

        "content": "The crucial pre-Christmas shopping period failed to be a gift for retailers, as consumers reined in spending on presents, preferring instead to spend their money on going out, according to the latest surveys. Christmas parties and cinema releases such as Wonka spurred spending in December, while the yuletide shopping frenzy “fizzled”, according to Barclays spending figures. Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium said spending was held back by weak consumer confidence.   Related: ‘Remarksable’: M&S set to be bright spark of festive retail season amid discount war   Total UK retail sales increased by 1.7% in December year on year, against a growth of 6.9% in December 2022.  These numbers are below the three-month average growth of 2.3% and fall short of the 12-month average growth of 3.6%. The BRC said that volumes probably fell once inflation was accounted for. “The festive period failed to make amends for a challenging year of sluggish retail sales growth, as weak consumer confidence continued to hold back spending,” the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said.  “The post-Christmas sales were unsuccessful in enticing spend in areas such as furniture and homeware, with households remaining cautious about making larger purchases.” She said 2024 “looks to be another challenging year” for retailers and their customers, as spending will continue to be constrained by high living costs. Barclays said consumer card spending increased by 2.3% year on year in December, lower than November’s growth of 2.9%, as retail spending failed to maintain the momentum it had built up in November through early seasonal discounts. It was lower than the current annual inflation rate of 3.9%, suggesting sales volumes fell. Spending on digital content and subscriptions, such as on-demand films or services such as Netflix and Apple TV Plus, rose by 11.6% during the festive period as some streaming platforms increased their prices.  “Hospitality and leisure businesses will be encouraged by December’s strong growth, particularly in the entertainment category, which saw growing demand for live shows, new films and TV series,” the Barclays head of retail, Karen Johnson, said. “Meanwhile, grocery and retail spending didn’t see as much of an increase as we might have expected during the height of the festive season. This is likely due to many retailers and supermarkets starting discounts and promotional activity earlier than usual.” Spending on essential items slowed from November’s 3.3% uplift to 1.8%, driven by a 12.5% fall in fuel spending because of falling prices, while slowing food inflation meant supermarket shopping rose 2.8% year on year, the lowest increase since September 2022. On the other hand, specialist food and drink stores including butchers and delicatessens enjoyed a 5.1% uptick as consumers chose to invest in premium, seasonal ingredients and support their local businesses in the run-up to Christmas. Clothing and department stores fell back into decline – down 2% and 0.2% respectively – after a rise in November, probably due to retailers starting their festive promotional activity earlier in November rather than December.  In contrast, spending on entertainment and travel soared by 12.3% and 14.1% respectively as consumers booked experiences and getaways for 2024."

        "content": "Sales of CDs rose last year for the first time in two decades, helping to lift the UK’s total spending on music to the highest level since the days when Destiny’s Child, Limp Bizkit and David Gray were topping the album charts. The value of all music sales – including spending on streaming, vinyl, CDs and downloads – rose 9.6% in 2023 to reach £2.2bn, just 0.08% shy of the record 22 years earlier, according to the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association (ERA). The biggest-selling album was The Weeknd’s The Highlights, although Taylor Swift’s album releases dominated the market, while the best-performing track was Miley Cyrus’s Flowers. Sales of CDs rose 2%, as a result of price inflation and the success of more expensive exclusive albums being snapped up by music buffs, some of whom are opting for the still relatively cheap CD format instead of, or as well as, vinyl. While the number of CDs sold continued to fall – by almost 7% – that marked a dramatic improvement from the 20% slide in 2022 and was the lowest rate of decline since 2015. CDs – which retail at about £10 or less for an album, about half the price of a similar LP – are battling with vinyl as the format favoured by trendy students and middle-aged music fans. “It’s about collectors discovering CDs,” the ERA chief executive, Kim Bayley, said. “CDs are a digital format you can keep forever, and that’s attractive when people are subscribing across lots of different services. There are a lot of exclusives and memorabilia.” She added that the number of CDs being sold was expected to stabilise, or possibly increase, because more independent retailers were beginning to stock the format amid improved demand, as young people joined older fans of the format as a way to show off their music collections. Phil Halliday, the managing director of the UK’s biggest music and entertainment retailer, HMV, said the chain had been seeing strong sales of deluxe collectible albums by bands for a while: “demand for that is kind of fervent”. He said that this year the retailer had also been surprised by teenage shoppers snapping up CDs and was increasingly catering for their tastes. “They want something they can put on their shelf that says they like Joy Division or Nirvana, and they don’t want to spend what a record costs,” he said. “A CD has got a lot of the same as a vinyl album – like liner notes.” Vinyl sales also benefited from demand for physical music formats, bouncing back from a tricky year in 2022, rising by 18% in value terms and nearly 12% in volume last year. However, sales of physical music formats remain very small in comparison with streaming, sales of which rose 9.8% to £2.2bn last year, compared with a total £311m for vinyl and CDs. An overall 8% rise in sales of digital entertainment, including games, video and music, drove a 7% increase in the total market to £11.9bn. Sales of physical videos and games sank by 18.8% and 4.4% respectively. Digital video sales rose 11.6% so that film overtook gaming to regain its position as the UK’s biggest entertainment source for the first time in about a decade as newer services such as Paramount+ and ITVX added to the choice available from the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Apple TV. The biggest-selling video title of the year was Avatar – the Way of Water, which generated sales of 560,000. Total sales of video rose 10% to £4.9bn, while total sales of games rose 2.9% to £4.7bn. The biggest-selling console game was the latest iteration of the Fifa-backed football game EA Sports FC 24, with the new title selling in almost identical quantities to its predecessor, about 2.39m copies."

        "content": "It is 12 months, almost to the day, since sense prevailed and the government abandoned its reckless plan to privatise Channel 4. The threat to sell the broadcaster after 40 years seemed to be motivated chiefly by political spite, rather than any coherent idea to improve the lot of the UK’s creative industries. Channel 4’s management did well to defend its corner so robustly. A state-owned entity that works with independent producers, and pays its way by funding itself commercially, adds greatly to biodiversity in TV-land. A sale to a foreign buyer (probably) would have been an irretrievable error. One cannot say, however, that Channel 4 has gone from strength to strength since the big reprieve. The TV advertising market in 2023 probably had its biggest fall since the 2008 financial crisis – chief executive, Alex Mahon, referred to “market shock territory” in testimony to MPs in November. After three years of surpluses up to 2022, Channel 4 expects two years of losses. It has cut back on commissioning to extend budgets, adding to wider woes among independent producers, some of whom have complained bitterly about late cancellations. Now comes what the Guardian revealed is likely to be a heavy round of job losses – possibly as many as 200 – among its own workforce, that is thought to have increased from the 1,200 recorded at the end of 2022. Mahon didn’t specify numbers in her internal memo on Monday but did confirm “there will be an impact on jobs”.   Related: Channel 4 tells staff a round of major job cuts is looming   The cuts look inevitable given the bleak market picture painted by Mahon and her chair, Sir Ian Cheshire, at the select committee seven weeks ago. And a complicating factor is the need to keep investing in digital infrastructure to match the pace of viewers’ switch towards streaming. ITV et al face the same pressures. Nobody is pretending this stuff is easy when the advertising market is on the slide. But Channel 4 could also do itself a favour at this point by demonstrating restraint on pay in its upper ranks. News of bumper bonuses for the feelgood year of 2022 landed horribly in July 2023, by which time the pain in the independent sector – and among its largely freelance staff – was being felt on the ground. Mahon was awarded almost £1.5m for 2022, comprising £741,000 in fixed pay, £594,000 in annual bonus and £155,000 as a special “retention” bonus to cover the period when the privatisation risk was in the air. The retention element was subsequently “deferred indefinitely”, as it was for chief operating officer, Jonathan Allan, and chief content officer, Ian Katz, but not before it became a flashpoint with the production sector. One focus for 2023’s awards, then, will be on the regular performance-related bonuses for the top trio. Commissioning deferrals, an annual loss and now job cuts, you would think, would make the case for giving bonuses a year off. Except that’s not what Cheshire said when asked directly at the select committee if executive remuneration would fall. Pressures are coming from the ad market, replied Cheshire, “but the rest of the performance on remit and public service is going very well”, adding that “we will work out what the score is at the end of the day.” If the score still adds up to bonuses at the top, one suspects Channel 4 will lose a chunk of the goodwill it generated during the privatisation kerfuffle. Not all the challenges for the independent sector can be heaped on Channel 4, it should be said. The squeeze is coming from all directions. But it is the broadcaster most closely aligned with the UK indies and seen as its partner. At times like these, and when you’re also making cuts among your own staff, bosses have to be seen to share the pain."

        "content": "The top director responsible for safety and security at Sellafield is to leave the vast nuclear waste dump in north-west England, it has emerged. Mark Neate, the Sellafield environment, safety and security director, is to leave the organisation later this year. Neate reports directly to Euan Hutton, the interim chief executive of Sellafield, the nuclear waste and decommissioning site in Cumbria, which is also the world’s largest store of plutonium. Multiple safety and cybersecurity failings, as well as claims of a “toxic” working culture, were revealed in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into Sellafield, last month. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the reports were “deeply concerning” and wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the state-owned body which ultimately runs Sellafield, demanding a “full explanation”. In his response last month, the NDA chief executive, David Peattie, said there had been “necessary changes to the leadership, governance, and risk management of cyber” and responsibility for its cyber function had been moved. A new head of cybersecurity was due to take up the role this month, which Peattie said would ensure “sustained focus and leadership on this matter”. Sellafield said Neate had responsibility for cybersecurity operations until January 2023, when control was shifted to report to its chief information officer. It declined to say whether Neate’s departure was related to cybersecurity and safety failings at the site and said that he made the decision to leave last autumn. Sources claimed the timing of the exit of Sellafield’s longest-serving director was related to the company’s performance in critical areas including safety and security. After the Guardian approached Sellafield for comment on Neate’s departure, the company released a statement saying that Neate would be in post for “several more months” and was leaving after a “career dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of the Sellafield site and its workforce”. Neate said: “I took stock at the end of the summer break and ultimately decided that 2024 was the right time for me to move on.” Neate joined Sellafield in 2012 and has held a number of roles, including director of security and resilience. He has a military background, including as a strategist during the Iraq war and working with the US army under the then general David Petraeus. Sellafield is yet to confirm an exact leaving date for the executive. In an interview in 2022, Neate said he was proud of Sellafield’s security record, and acknowledged his responsibilities. “If we sneeze here the whole industry gets a cold,” he said. “I do see it as fun,” he said of his job. Sellafield has “more work to do” to reduce safety incidents, according to its annual accounts for the year to March 2023 which were published in late December. The accounts showed that annual operating costs at the taxpayer-funded site climbed by £170m to £2.5bn. Last financial year the company pleaded guilty to a prosecution brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation under health and safety regulations after an employee was injured falling from a scaffold ladder while carrying out repair work. The company was fined £400,000 and ordered to pay £29,210 in costs as well as a surcharge of £190. The GMB trade union last month called on the government and nuclear authorities to take “urgent action” to address concerns over safety at Sellafield. Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was last year placed into a form of “special measures” for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack after the Guardian revealed that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its networks. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: “Mark Neate has made the decision to leave Sellafield following a decade of dedicated service working as environment, safety and security director. “Mark has brought significant value to Sellafield over the past decade, including the role that he played in running our response to the Covid crisis, and we are sad to see him go. “He made the decision in autumn last year to leave the company, and will continue in his role to ensure a smooth transition to his successor.” Sellafield issued a range of responses to the Guardian’s reports into its cybersecurity, safety and cultural issues, which it published online."

        "content": "Fujitsu, the technology company whose flawed Horizon IT system is at the heart of the Post Office scandal, has posted profits of £22m in its UK arm and paid out millions in salary and bonuses to directors, its latest accounts reveal. The $30bn (£23.5bn) Japanese company designed the now infamous centralised accounting software, which gave the false impression that about 3,500 owner-operators in charge of sub-post offices had stolen money from the company. As a result, about 700 were wrongly prosecuted. Dozens of the victims died before they could clear their names or claim compensation and the scandal has been linked to four suicides.   Related: Paula Vennells to Ed Davey: the people with questions to answer on the Post Office scandal   The Post Office, which is effectively owned by the government, has set aside £244m to compensate victims of the scandal, but Fujitsu has not faced any financial consequences and has continued to win lucrative taxpayer-funded contracts. Accounts filed at Companies House on Monday show that Fujitsu’s UK arm recorded strong profits as a result of ongoing work for government departments such as the Home Office and Ministry of Defence, as well as for the Post Office itself, which continues to use a newer version of the Horizon system. UK-based Fujitsu Services Ltd, which houses the Japanese firm’s UK and Irish businesses, posted pre-tax profits of £22m in 2022, on revenues of £1.3bn, the accounts show. Its three directors shared pay of £2.3m, of which £1.3m was paid to one unnamed executive. Separate accounts for Fujitsu’s European holding company, which also includes operations in Scandinavia and the Middle East, indicate that its directors were also paid bonuses. Two directors of Fujitsu Services Holdings plc received share-based payouts as part of a “long-term incentive scheme”, a form of bonus that rewards executives for performance, typically over several years. Details of Fujitsu’s performance in the UK emerged a day after peers called for greater scrutiny of its role in the Horizon affair, including the possibility that the Japanese company should pay compensation to victims of one of the largest miscarriages of justice in British history. In a joint letter to the Sunday Times, Lord Falconer and Lord Abuthnot said the ongoing inquiry into the scandal “needs to examine in detail the role of Fujitsu, which provided and managed the faulty software. Was Fujitsu completely unaware of the devastating effect of its actions? Should it not contribute to the compensation claims of hundreds of sub-postmasters?” Fujitsu declined to answer questions about its accounts. A spokesperson said: “The current Post Office Horizon IT statutory inquiry is examining complex events stretching back over 20 years to understand who knew what, when, and what they did with that knowledge. “The inquiry has reinforced the devastating impact on postmasters’ lives and that of their families, and Fujitsu has apologised for its role in their suffering. “Fujitsu is fully committed to supporting the inquiry in order to understand what happened and to learn from it. Out of respect for the inquiry process, it would be inappropriate for Fujitsu to comment further at this time.”"

        "content": "I am grateful for Rebecca Nicholson’s excellent critique of the TV miniseries Mr Bates vs the Post Office (Mr Bates vs the Post Office review – Toby Jones is perfect in a devastating tale of a national scandal, 1 January), which I watched in one sitting. I thought I knew the story, but realised I didn’t know the half of it. With increasing incredulity and rage, I viewed as it revealed what lengths some senior executives and boards will go to protect their companies even when they know the lives of so many good and honest people are being ruined or terminated. How can it have taken the law and government 20 years to right this wrong? And why are taxpayers picking up the cost while the individuals who behaved so very reprehensibly keep their bonuses and contracts? Not one has faced consequences. I feel this particularly strongly as at the time our daughter and son-in-law were running a sub-post office not far from one featured in the drama. It could have been them and it makes me shudder. Something is very wrong in our society.Dr John BeerFarnham, Surrey • I’ve followed the Post Office/Horizon IT scandal for a few years and I was surprised Sir Ed Davey admits he knew of the scandal when he was postal affairs minister from 2010-2012 (Ed Davey accuses Post Office bosses of misleading him over Horizon IT scandal, 3 January). Rather than admit fault for doing nothing, Davey appears to be lamely blaming the Post Office for blocking direct access to the sub-postmasters. Nothing would have stopped Davey asking for those details from civil service researchers and picking up the phone himself to contact Alan Bates. He didn’t and only now is criticising the Post Office after lives were lost and ruined. Equally, Davey hasn’t openly and robustly criticised the Post Office for the slowness with which compensation is being paid, or for the gong awarded to Post Office CEO Paula Vennells. Instead, he has been happy to accept a gong himself, despite knowing of this sorry situation, and doing very little to help. It’s been said many times, the awarding of honours needs a complete overhaul.Richard TaylorLondon • I would like to congratulate you on your reporting of the sub‑postmasters scandal. The ITV drama brings the whole terrible saga to life in an almost unbearable way. The question for us now as a society is what is to be done? I cannot bear to think that, after all this publicity, we as a people will allow things to continue in their present fashion. I invite the Guardian to lead a campaign to garner support for a petition to parliament to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion on behalf of all those who have suffered.Neil MorganBedford • Lovely that Royal Mail is featuring the Spice Girls on its new stamps (Report, 5 January). If it needs ideas for more inspirational personalities to appear on every letter in the land could I suggest Alan Bates for his relentless pursuit of those responsible for one of the UK’s biggest miscarriages of justice?Elizabeth GriffithsDorking, Surrey • Our politicians have become so duplicitous that the only people making effective and honest statements about the injustices surrounding us (the most obvious being the Post Office scandal) are actors.Paul AllenKenilworth, Warwickshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section. "

        "content": "Shares in Boeing, and the parts supplier Spirit AeroSystems, have fallen amid renewed fears over the safety of the aircraft manufacturer’s 737 Max planes after an Alaska Airlines flight was forced into an emergency landing on Friday.\nPart of the jet’s fuselage that was ripped out in midair was found on Sunday in the back yard of a house in Portland, Oregon.\nThe plug door – a panel fitted to replace an emergency door in some versions of the 737 Max 9 – tore away from the plane soon after it took off from Portland airport, bound for Ontario, California.\n\n Related: Boeing and aerospace supplier shares fall after mid-flight Alaska Airlines accident – business live \n\nUS regulators ordered the temporary grounding of all Max 9 models with door plugs pending inspections after Friday’s incident, whose consequences could have been much more severe but for the fact the nearest seats were vacant and passengers were still wearing seatbelts.\nThe hole in the fuselage was described as being “as wide as a refrigerator” and the wind blowing out of it was so powerful it sucked the shirt off a teenage boy sitting nearby, but the plane managed to land safely with no casualties.\n Interactive\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched an investigation and said the discovery of the missing door plug, which fell near a schoolteacher’s house, would be a “key component”.\nThe chair of the NTSB, Jennifer Homendy, said the incident must have been a “terrifying experience”.\nInvestigations will proceed without evidence from the cockpit voice recorder, because it had been overwritten after capturing only two hours of data.\nHomendy also said there had been three previous automatic alerts in the cockpit on the same Alaska Airlines aircraft over cabin pressure, in its two months in service.\nThe auto pressurisation fail light was triggered on 7 December, 3 January and 4 January, but she said it was unclear if there was any connection between those events and Friday’s near-disaster.\nThe airline had, however, decided to restrict the plane from long flights over water in case the warning reappeared, Homendy said. \nIndonesia said it was grounding the three Max 9 models operated by Lion Air, despite having a functioning exit door, until further notice. Lion Air suffered the first of two major air crashes that prompted the 737 Max to be withdrawn from service worldwide in 2019, which were eventually blamed on issues with its flight control software.\nShares in Boeing dropped 9% when Wall Street opened, before regaining some losses to be down 7% by Monday afternoon. Shares in Spirit AeroSystems were down 14%, though eased later to 8% down. \nOther aerospace manufacturers also appeared affected by the negative market sentiment on Monday, with Senior, a Boeing supplier, down by 3%.\nSpirit manufactures the door part at its plant in Wichita, Kansas, but fits them semi-completed, according to a report for Reuters. Boeing will normally remove the plug in the next part of the production process at its factory in Renton, Washington, as it fits out interiors. The process means that investigators will be looking for flaws in assembly at both firms.\nBoeing said it plans to hold a company-wide virtual meeting on Tuesday to address safety after the incident. \nThe chief executive, Dave Calhoun, told employees in a message on Sunday that its response “is and must be the focus”, adding: “When serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don’t happen again.”\nAlaska Airlines cancelled a further 60 flights on Monday and said disruption was expected to continue at least until the middle of this week.\nThe biggest operator of the model, United Airlines, has grounded its 79 Max 9s, and cancelled 230 flights on Sunday, 8% of scheduled departures.\nNo European airlines operate the 737 Max 9 in the relevant configuration, according to the EU safety regulator, EASA."

        "content": "An incident on an Alaska Airlines flight where part of the fuselage tore away has again put the spotlight on Boeing’s newest and top-selling model, the 737 Max. Here we look at what happened and what it might mean for Boeing and its 737 Max.\nWhat exactly happened this time?\nA door plug detached from the jet minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon – effectively leaving a gaping door-sized hole in the wall of the main passenger cabin. The plane made an emergency landing, with all passengers and crew safe. Accident investigators said that the consequences of the incident – which occurred at a relatively low altitude of 16,000 feet with all passengers still strapped in, and no one sitting in the seat adjacent to the rupture – could have been much more serious.\n\n Related: Boeing shares fall after door panel blown out of plane mid-flight \n\nWhat caused it and what are the authorities doing?\nThe cause is so far unknown – but now that the missing door plug, which landed in a teacher’s back yard, has been located, US investigators hope to make progress. Boeing 737 Max 9 planes with similar door plugs have been grounded on order of the US Federal Aviation Administration, pending inspections to check their safety. Investigators said that an auto pressurisation fail light on the same Alaska Airlines aircraft had triggered three times in its two months in service, leading the airline to decide to restrict the plane from long flights over water.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAre all 737 Max planes affected? What is the difference between the models?\nNo. This is the 737 Max 9, a longer version than the most common version, the Max 8. It is capable of carrying 220 passengers, a number that would require it to have an additional emergency exit in the middle of the cabin. However, several airlines, including Alaska, have not requested interiors with the maximum number of seats – meaning that the door is instead plugged.\nWho operates the 737 Max 9?\nOnly 11 airlines have so far ordered this variant, and the majority of flights are operated by just two carriers in the US: United Airlines has 79 737 Max 9s in its fleet, all of which are configured with door plugs. Alaska has 65 of the same model, again with door plugs. Aeromexico and the Panamanian carrier Copa are the next biggest, and mostly with plugged variants, while no other airline owns more than five such planes. According to data from the analysts Cirium, almost 20,000 flights worldwide were scheduled this month on 737 Max 9s.\nIs it only 737 Max 9s that have such door plugs?\nNo, and investigators do not yet know where the fault lies. But aviation regulators fear that whatever fault developed might be repeated in similar models of the same production or assembly lines. The fuselage parts are manufactured and installed at Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing’s largest supplier, and normally reinstalled by Boeing during the production process. The Alaskan 737 Max 9 whose door plug blew off was only two months old.\nWhy is the 737 Max so well known?\nThe Boeing 737 was long the world’s bestselling aircraft, a single-aisle plane designed to operate short-haul flights, and the 737 Max was the newest iteration. But while only aviation enthusiasts might know or care what model of plane is being flown, the 737 Max hit the headlines after two fatal crashes soon after its introduction into service in 2018, at Lion Air and then Ethiopian Airlines, killing 346 people onboard. And, unusually, it became clear that the aircraft’s own design flaws were to blame.\nSurely all that has been ironed out?\nYes – the plane was grounded worldwide, modified, and then intensively retested by regulators globally before recertification. Huge orders have been placed by carriers such as Ryanair, which ordered another 300 of the 737 Max 10 model last year. Airlines love the savings promised from greater fuel efficiency for each passenger. But any problems around the Max are likely to provoke more scrutiny, headlines and unease than other models.\nSo have there been other concerns?\nIndeed. It is barely a week since Boeing urged its airline customers to check for loose or missing bolts in the rudder control after two instances were identified, “out of an abundance of caution”, according to the manufacturer. Last year it emerged that it had identified faults in fuselage parts supplied by Spirit, holding up production of more planes."

Shares in Boeing have tumbled 9% at the opening bell on Wall Street, as the airline manufacturer is shaken by the fallout from in-flight blowout on a 737 Max last Friday. Fuselage manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems dropped 12% in early trading, but have now recovered to a loss of 8%. Investors gave their first reaction to the news that the plug door on an Alaska Airways flight tore away from the plane soon after it took off from Portland airport for Ontario, California. The door plug is a panel fitted to replace an emergency door in some versions of the 737 Max 9 plane. US regulators ordered the temporary grounding of all Max 9 models with door plugs pending inspections after Friday’s incident.

The New York Federal Reserve has reported that inflation one year from now is expected to be at 3%, the lowest reading since January 2021. That’s down on a forecast of 3.4% in November. Looking further ahead, inflation in three years time is forecast to be 2.6%, compared to 3% in November, while price pressures five years ahead were at 2.5% versus 2.7% in November.     3.54pm GMT  German farmers block roads with tractors in subsidy row  Over in Germany, farmers kicked off a week of nationwide protests against subsidy cuts today, blocking roads with tractors. The demonstrations pile misery on Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition as it struggles to fix a budget mess and contain rising far-right forces. Reuters has the details::  Convoys of tractors and trucks gathered on roads in sub-zero temperatures in nearly all 16 federal states, while protesters clashed with police and leading politicians warned that the unrest could be co-opted by extremists. The protests have forced Scholz’s unpopular government into a tricky balancing act, trying to keep a lid on the unrest while sticking to fiscal discipline after a constitutionalcourt ruling in November threw its spending plans into disarray. “No beer without farmers,” read one protest banner, while another tractor had a poster from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that read “Our farmers come first.” Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose return from holiday last week was disrupted by furious farmers trying to storm the ferry he was on, warned in a video message on Monday that farmers’ right to protest could be exploited by fringe groups. “Calls are circulating with coup fantasies, extremist groups are forming and ethnic-nationalist symbols are being openly displayed,” said Habeck. Farmers called the protests in response to the government’s decision to phase out a tax break on agricultural diesel as it tries to bring its 2024 budget over the finish line while complying with the constitutional court ruling. “For a farm like mine, I would lose about 10,000 euros,” said a farmer from Bavaria, Ralf Huber. “For our businesses, it’s a catastrophe.”      3.17pm GMT   Bonds issued by Boeing and also by Spirit AeroSystem are both falling in value today. Bloomberg has the details:  The spread on Boeing’s 5.15% notes due 2030 widened 18 basis points to 113 basis points as of 9:53 a.m. New York time, on track for the biggest one-day increase since Jan. 13, 2023, according to Trace bond trading data. The cost to protect the company’s debt against default for five years in the credit derivatives market jumped 16 basis points to 82 basis points, according to ICE Data Services. Spirit AeroSystems — which makes the fuselage for the 737 — also saw its bonds weaken and was one the biggest losers in the US high-yield secondary market Monday morning. Its 4.6% note due 2028 fell about 4.6 cents on the dollar to 83 cents, the biggest drop since April.

Wall Street traders are clearly alarmed by last Friday’s mid-air accident on an Alaska Airlines aircraft, in which a door plug on a Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out during the flight. Spirit Aerosystems, which manufacturers fuselages for 737 Max, is also under pressures – its shares are down over 12% in early trading. Alaska Airlines’ shares are down 5.6%.

It says:  This is partly due to Germany, whose economy is still in recession and therefore in crisis.   Investor morale in the euro zone improved for the third consecutive month in January to its highest level since May, but a turnaround for the 20-country currency bloc is not a done deal, the latest Sentix's index shows today. https://t.co/TdcGazThwY— RTÉ Business (@RTEbusiness) January 8, 2024      1.21pm GMT  Billionaire Bet365 boss's £270m pay packet is 'neither fair or proportionate'  The billionaire boss of Bet365 is facing some criticism after being paid more than £270m last year. Denise Coates, who set up Bet365 in a portable building in Stoke-on-Trent in 2000, received the bumper payout despite the firm making a £60m loss in the last financial year. Coates was paid a salary of £220.6m in the year to 26 March 2023, a £7m increase on her pay the year before, according to Bet365’s latest accounts filed at Companies House on Monday. As its controlling shareholder she is also entitled to at least 50% of the £100m dividend that was also paid for the year. The High Pay Centre, a thinktank, argue that such a pay package is neither fair or proportionate. Luke Hildyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre, says:  “People deserve to be rewarded for innovation and success but there’s a question of what’s sensible and proportionate. Nobody becomes a multi-billionaire in isolation from wider society. In this case, the wealth depends on money coming out of gamblers’ pockets, the efforts of thousands of staff, plus wider factors like people having some disposable income, a secure and reliable internet network or all the infrastructure that goes into staging sports events. Ultimately, Britain’s prosperity depends on how the wealth our economy generates is shared. Pouring hundreds of millions of pounds more on top of billionaire fortunes every year isn’t a good way to maximise living standards and it over-values the contribution that the super-rich have made.”      12.50pm GMT   Elsewhere in the markets, the oil price has extended its earlier falls (see opening post) after Saudi Arabia cut the price of its crude exports. Brent crude is now down 2.5% at $76.77 per barrel, towards the six-month low of $72.29 touched last month.  Saudi’s price cuts may be a sign that demand is weakening, or that strong supplies from rival producers such as the US could create a production glut. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB, says:  This is probably not a signal that Saudi Arabia is suddenly shifting strategy from ‘price’ to ‘volume’. But, it could be taken as a warning that Saudi Arabia won’t be the only oil producing nation to travel this road alone forever. If OPEC+ requires additional cuts to sustain the oil price within the USD 80-90/b range, and the organisation hesitates to support these necessary cuts, the likelihood of Saudi Arabia implementing further unilateral cuts is uncertain.      12.20pm GMT    Boeing shares slide 7.8% in premarket trading after FAA grounds dozens of 737 Max 9s#NiftyBank #Nifty50 #banknifty #niftybank #Dow #SP500 #Nasdaq #stockmarket #stocks #zerodha #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Cq3FdfICdk— Nifty speak loud (@Niftyspeakloud) January 8, 2024   Stock index futures signal a lower Monday opening after the weekly winning streak ends.

The incident comes just a few days into a new year which Calhoun heralded as crucial to a turnaround. Bloomberg reports:  Boeing is still feeling the reverberations of two deadly 737 Max crashes almost five years ago that shook confidence in the company. Now Boeing’s fraught relationship with Spirit, its biggest supplier, stands to face fresh scrutiny. As the crisis in confidence deepened over the weekend, Calhoun canceled Boeing’s annual senior leadership retreat, which was to have begun Monday outside of San Diego. And he summoned employees to an all-hands meeting to be webcast from Boeing’s 737 factory on Tuesday, where he and other senior executives will address the near-tragedy and reinforce Boeing’s commitment to safety, quality, integrity and transparency. While Boeing has made progress in recent years, “situations like this are a reminder that we must remain focused on continuing to improve every day,” Calhoun told employees in a company-wide message on Sunday.

Johnson (@byEricMJohnson) January 8, 2024   Updated at 10.49am GMT    10.33am GMT   Boeing’s reputation has been “shattered” after the incident last Friday involving one of its 737 Max planes flown by Alaska Airlines, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. He explains:  It is the latest in a string of problems for the company, which include the grounding of 737 Max plans in 2019 after two crashes and subsequent delivery delays and production issues. Safety is of paramount importance in the aviation sector and airlines using 737 Max planes will be thinking long and hard about their future aircraft requirements and how Boeing might play a smaller role, or none at all. That might explain why Airbus shares jumped on Monday as investors are betting it could take even more market share from Boeing. There is no room for error building planes and cutting corners in the production stage could have catastrophic consequences. There are naturally questions being asked about the quality checks and whether Boeing is trying to do too much too fast. Boeing’s management will be under considerable pressure from the regulators and customers to explain what’s going on, which means considerable headwinds ahead for the business. It’s no wonder investors have raced to sell the shares as the risks to the investment case have just shot up.”      10.25am GMT   Boeing shares listed in Frankfurt have already dropped sharply, down by 7.5% on the German exchange. Its European aerospace rival, Airbus, are up 1.8% this morning.     10.22am GMT  Why European planes haven't been grounded  European safety regulators yesterday followed the US FAA in taking action against the Boeing 737 Max 9, after the Alaska Airlines panel blowout. However, while the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has formally adopted the FAA directive, it believes no operators in EASA member states are actually affected. EASA’s understanding is that no European airline operate the aircraft in the “relevant configuration”, in which the mid-cabin exit is replaced by a ”plug-in panel”. EASA explains:  This configuration is typically adopted by airlines flying lower-density operations (with lower passenger capacity) where this additional exit is not required to meet evacuation safety requirements. The 737-9 aircraft operating in Europe do not have this configuration and are therefore not grounded by the EAD and can continue to operate normally.   Updated at 10.39am GMT    10.19am GMT   The UK Civil Aviation Authority said on Saturday there are no UK-registered planes affected.  The CAA will require any 737 MAX 9 operators entering its airspace to comply with the FAA directive.     10.14am GMT  Fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems shares tumble 16%  Shares in aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselage for Boeing’s 737 Max, have fallen by over 16% in pre-market trading. Reuters has reported that Spirit manufactured and initially installed the fuselage part on the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet that suffered a blowout on Friday, but that Boeing also has a key role in the usual completion process. Because of a “complex, two-tier installation process”, investigators are expected to examine whether any flaws occurred at Spirit’s giant fuselage plant in Wichita, Kansas, or at the Boeing factory outside Seattle, sources said.  Updated at 12.21pm GMT    10.09am GMT   Some airline shares are also weakening following last weekend’s in-flight blowout at a 737 Max 9 plane. United Airlines are down 3% in premarket trading, while Alaska Airlines are down 4.6%. Both airlines grounded all of their Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners last weekend as they waited to be told how to inspect the planes to prevent another in-flight blowout like the one that damaged an Alaska jet. Alaska cancelled more than one-fifth of its flights on Sunday, while United scrubbed nearly 200 flights, according to Marketwatch.     9.43am GMT  Boeing shares fall 8% in premarket trading after 737 Max 9 grounding  Shares in Boeing are set to fall sharply when Wall Street opens, after US federal regulators temporarily grounded some 737 Max planes. Boeing’s shares have dropped by over 8% in pre-market trading, falling from $249 to $228.50.  Boeing shares drop 8% in premarket following midair window panel blowout https://t.co/19JJ4qBA1b— MarketWatch (@MarketWatch) January 8, 2024  Investors are reacting to the news that an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft suffered a blowout that left a gaping hole in the side of the fuselage. The plug door tore off the left side of the jet on Friday after it took off at Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, depressurising the plane and forcing the pilots to turn back and land. The chunk of fuselage has now been found in a teacher’s back yard, the US’s transportation safety board (NTSB) reported.   Related: Oregon teacher finds fuselage from Boeing 737 Max 9 in his back yard   On Saturday, the US Federal Aviation Administration ordered the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft operated by U.S. airlines or in U.S. territory. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said:  “The FAA is requiring immediate inspections of certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes before they can return to flight. Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB’s investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282.”  The FAA’s ruling means 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft are temporarily grounded. No one was seriously injured during Friday’s incident, after which 171 passengers and six crew landed safely. But the incident has raised fresh safety concerns about Boeing planes. Five years ago, two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving its Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft left 346 people dead.

Scottish Power, EDF and Octopus have all been given the green light to install prepayment meters with a warrant, or to switch a smart meter to prepayment meter mode. This practice was suspended last year, after an investigation by the Times found that debt agents working for British Gas had ignored signs of vulnerability and broken into customers’ homes to force fit pay-as-you-go meters. Scottish Power, EDF and Octopus have met Ofgem’s conditions to restart installing prepayment meters in the homes of customers who have fallen behind on their bills. But they must make at least 10 attempts to contact a customer before a prepayment meter is installed, and carry out a site welfare visit first. They are also banned from installing pay-as-you-go meters in homes where an occupant is 75 or older, or where there are children under 2, or where there are residents with severe health issues, or where no-one has the physical and mental capacity to top up the meter.

Alex Mahon told the workforce in an internal email on Monday morning that the broadcaster needed to “accelerate” plans to become a “genuinely digital-first public service broadcaster” following the worst slump in traditional TV advertising since the financial crisis in 2008. “Given all the market change and complexity that we need to adapt to, there will be an impact on jobs at Channel 4,” wrote Mahon, the day after the Guardian revealed the broadcaster was planning its biggest cuts to jobs in more than 15 years.   Related: Channel 4 confirms round of major job cuts is looming       8.58am GMT  Channel 4 plans deepest job cuts in over 15 years after TV ad slump  In the media industry, Channel 4 is drawing up plans to cut potentially as many as 200 jobs in its biggest round of layoffs in more than 15 years. The cuts, reported by my colleague Mark Sweney this morning, come as Channel 4 seeks to make savings to weather the worst TV advertising downturn since 2008. The broadcaster, which has undergone a rapid expansion in recent years with staff numbers swelling to a record level of more than 1,200, aims to dramatically reduce a wage bill that now stands at more than £108m a year. It said the restructure, which management began working on late last year, was intended to focus on accelerating its digital streaming strategy while limiting the extent to which it must make deep cuts to its £700m-plus content budget.

Shell is leading the fallers, down 2.3%, after it reported impairment charges of up to $4.5bn this morning. BP are also in the fallers, down 1.1%, following the drop in the oil price.     8.28am GMT  Shell flags Q4 writedown of up to $4.5bn  Elsewhere in the energy sector, Shell is taking impairment charges of up to $4.5bn on its assets. Shell reported this morning that it will cut the value of its assets by between $2.5bn and $4.5bn in the last quarter. These impairments are partly related to Shell’s Singapore refining and chemicals hub, which it is looking to sell, but are also due to “macro & external developments”, Shell adds. But Shell also predicted that earnings at its integrated gas division are likely to be significantly higher in the last quarter of 2023 than in the third quarter. The announcement comes ahead of Shell’s fourth-quarter earnings, due on 1 February. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says,  “Shell reported a mixed trading statement – it is expecting quarterly integrated gas trading to be significantly higher than the third quarter thanks to seasonal factors and increased optimisation opportunities. However, it said profits from oil and chemicals would be lower resulting in a loss in that division. It is also facing an impairment charge of $2.5bn-$4.5bn in the fourth quarter, relating to its Singapore refining and chemicals hub. Shell has been facing some price target cuts from the analyst community so far this year including from Morgan Stanley and Bernstein ahead of today’s update. Over the last six months, shares in Shell are up by around 10% thanks to higher underlying oil prices since last summer and better-than-expected third quarter earnings. But strong supply in the United States and a sluggish demand outlook could keep a lid of oil price gains this year. However offsetting this are Opec+ supply cuts and possible interest rate cuts this year and the potential for China’s economy to improve.   Updated at 8.40am GMT    8.06am GMT   Wariness has returned to the financial markets at the start of the week, reports Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. Investors are assessing the risks of geopolitical conflict, she says, amid fresh signs of global economic slowdown and uncertainty about the trajectory of inflation. And on oil, she says:  Oil prices have been fluctuating, as fresh concerns about the Middle East have been brewing, amid worries about supply issues in the region, particularly given the attacks on tankers in the Red Sea. For now, focus has switched to signs of a dwindling appetite for oil globally, which have pushed down a barrel of Brent Crude to below $78. Saudi Arabia has flagged that it is seeing softening demand, prompting it to cut crude prices for buyers in all regions in February.   Updated at 8.39am GMT    8.00am GMT  Introduction: Oil dips as Saudi Arabia cuts Feb Arab Light crude price  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Oil is weakening this morning after Saudi Arabia cut the prices charged to its customers. The Middle Eastern energy powerhouse’s producer, Saudi Aramco, lowered its flagship Arab Light price to Asia by $2 per barrel, to $1.50 a barrel above the benchmark. That’s a larger reduction than many in the industry expected, and is the biggest price cut in 13 months. It lowers the February official selling price (OSP) of Saudi Arabia’s Arab Light crude to Asia to the lowest level in 27 months. Aramco also cut all prices for February delivery to Northwest Europe, Mediterranean and North America. The move indicates that concerns a slowing economy will hurt demand for oil are trumping fears that geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea will cause supply disruption. The news has knocked Brent crude, the oil benchmark, down by 1.2% at the start of the week to $77.80 per barrel.  Oil dropped after Saudi Arabia cut official selling prices for all regions, underscoring a worsening global outlook and outweighing concern over Red Sea tensions and supply disruptions in Libya.https://t.co/QmLlEgZ5vJ— Piotr Mieczkowski (@piotrmiecz) January 8, 2024  Late last year Saudi Arabia led the Opec+ group’s decision to make voluntary output cuts, to prevent a buildup of unsold oil. But those production cuts didn’t prevent oil posting its first annual fall since 2020 last year. Geopolitical tensions are still heightened this morning, with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warning yesterdat that Israel’s war against Hamas risked spreading throughout the region.   Related: Blinken returns to Middle East and warns of risk war could spread   IG analyst Tony Sycamore says those concerns will support the oil price:  “If we were just to focus on the fundamentals including, higher inventories, higher Opec/non-Opec production, and a lower-than-expected Saudi OSP, it would be impossible to be anything other than bearish crude oil. However, that doesn’t take into account the fact that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are undeniably rising again which will mean limited downside.”  Also coming up today Financial markets remain edgy, as doubts creep in about how quickly central banks will be able to lower interest rates this year.

        "content": "A trio of energy companies have been given permission to begin force-fitting prepayment meters in customers’ homes again if they adhere to strict new rules, ending a near year-long moratorium on the practice. EDF, Octopus and Scottish Power have been given the green light by the energy watchdog, Ofgem, to install prepayment meters under warrant, ending an industry-wide ban which was enforced amid an outcry over the impact on vulnerable customers. The three suppliers will have to meet a series of requirements before forcibly installing the meters, including making 10 attempts to contact a customer and providing £30 of credit.   Related: Energy regulator launches British Gas investigation over prepayment meters   Firms have been told to “refrain” from installing the meters in the homes of vulnerable groups, including households with children under two and those who rely on continued power supply for medical equipment. All energy suppliers in Great Britain were prevented from forcibly installing the meters into customers’ homes to recover debt after Ofgem belatedly stepped in to halt the practice last February after repeated warnings from campaign groups and MPs, and only after the Times reported that debt agents working for British Gas ignored signs of vulnerability to fit the meters. The Guardian revealed in April that energy suppliers had voluntarily agreed to stop installing the meters in the homes of customers over 85 without consent and would also make representatives wear body cameras once the ban was lifted. This was later made mandatory in their licence conditions – with the age minimum reduced to over-75 – and will continue to apply. The remaining energy suppliers remain banned. Ofgem has yet to publish a separate report into the conduct of British Gas, owned by Centrica. The Ofgem director general for markets, Tim Jarvis, said it had “made clear that suppliers must exhaust all other options before considering forced installation of a prepayment meter, and consumers can help themselves by reaching out to their supplier as soon as possible if they think they won’t be able to pay their bill, so payment options can be discussed”. Jarvis added: “While nobody wants to see the practices uncovered last year repeated, we also know that allowing households to build up unsustainable amounts of debt isn’t the right thing to do either.” However, Simon Francis, the coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said it was “outrageous that energy firms are seeking to use the courts to force people on to prepayment meters in the middle of winter. We still have grave concerns about the processes energy firms have in place for assessing vulnerabilities.” The cost of living crisis has put added pressure on to household bills, while energy suppliers’ balance sheets were squeezed by the rise in wholesale gas prices, which began in 2021. The mass approval of warrants to install the meters in UK courts has also come under scrutiny. Scottish Power said: “While we have met Ofgem’s strict criteria and been authorised to restart involuntary prepayment meter installations, where appropriate, this is always a last resort. Our focus will continue to be on supporting our customers to manage their debt and avoid the need for such action.” EDF said: “It is important to restart, under strict supervision from the regulator, processes that help individual customers get out of debt and protect all customers from additional charges.” Octopus said it has “no plans” to restart involuntary installations."

        "content": "The EU has announced €4bn (£3.4bn) of state aid investments in new factories producing electric batteries for cars, heat pumps and solar panels as it seeks to accelerate production and the uptake of green technologies and combat cheap Chinese imports. The Swedish battery producer Northvolt will receive €902m in state aid to build a new factory in Heide in Germany, while a wide range of clean tech factories in France are to get a €2.5bn bump in state aid. The investments form part of the EU’s mission to be climate neutral with net zero gas emissions by 2050 but are also designed to help insulate the bloc from the growing competition from Chinese car, solar panel and other green tech factories. It follows the approval of similar schemes in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, and Spain, worth in total €9.1bn, and with several others in the pipeline. “The production of net zero equipment in Europe is of strategic interest for the European economy and society. It has immense importance for achieving our goals in clean mobility, sustainability, and competitiveness,” said Margrethe Vestager, who is back in her role as executive vice-president of the commission in charge of competition policy after an unsuccessful bid to head the European Investment Bank. The EU said the money going to Northvolt’s gigafactory would enable it to “produce battery cells in Europe instead of the US”. It is the first state aid approved under a special scheme aimed to stop production facilities being lured overseas with the promise of greater foreign subsidies. Already Europe is feeling the strain of the head start China has had on producing lower cost electric cars. Last month the European leaders agreed to a three-year suspension of a 10% tariff that was due to come in on EU electric cars exported to the UK and British electric cars exported to the EU amid fears the increased cost to the consumer would give a further advantage to Chinese competitors. The Chinese conglomerate Build Your Dream (BYD), which launched lower-cost electric cars in the EU last summer, recently became the world’s number one producer of hybrid and battery-only vehicles. In November it was reported that BYD was planning to build its first European car factory in Hungary. The Chinese power battery company Eve Energy also started construction of its gigafactory in Hungary last year, while another player, Sunwoda, said it would also invest there. Vestager said the investment in Germany was “an important step for the electrification of transport in Europe while preserving the level playing field in the single market”. The near €3bn in state aid earmarked for France will support the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines and heat pumps, along with key component and critical raw material supply chains, the EU said. Last year the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced an investigation into potential Chinese state subsidies into the automotive industry, bringing with it the threat of a trade war. But during a visit to Beijing at the end of the year she tried to persuade Chinese officials that the European market would not remain open if it was found to compete unfairly with local enterprise."

        "content": "A directive to ground almost 200 near-new planes in the United States is not set to affect Australian skies – for now at least.\nOn Saturday, 171 of Boeing’s 737 Max 9 planes were grounded after a door panel blew out shortly after a flight in the US took off. In response, the US’s Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspections of the component that blew out of an Alaskan Airlines plane on Friday, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing back at Portland airport minutes after it departed.\nWhile no one was seriously injured in the incident, there are now safety questions about the plane and implications for similar models of what has become one of the most controversial generations of aircraft in modern commercial aviation.\n\n Related: Design flaws not suspected ‘at this time’ with Boeing Max 9 jets, investigators say \n\nJust hours after the incident, budget Australian carrier Bonza released a statement seeking to distance itself from the saga – despite not even operating the Max 9. “We have received assurance from Boeing that there is no impact to our fleet,” a Bonza spokesperson said.\nSo why is the global aviation community so on edge from this incident, and how could it impact Australia?\nWhat went wrong?\nThe US’s National Transportation Safety Board is still examining why the door panel in the middle of the plane’s fuselage blew out, leaving a hole “the size of a refrigerator” in the side of the plane. The force of decompression in the plane was so strong it blew open the cockpit door, Reuters reported, citing a person briefed on the investigation.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alaskan Airlines plane – which had been delivered just weeks earlier – was configured with fewer seats, meaning it required fewer emergency exits. As such, the mid-cabin exit was plugged with the panel that would ultimately blow out.\nOnly Max 9s with the same configuration have been grounded for inspections, in the US and Europe. While carriers such as Alaskan Airlines and United Airlines have suffered flight disruptions as their aircraft are checked (inspections take four to eight hours), the plane could return to full service relatively soon if no further issues are detected.\nSeparately, investigations of the incident are expected to examine two factories involved in the plane’s construction and assembly for potential flaws in design, manufacturing and installation, according to sources cited by Reuters.\nDo any airlines fly the Max 9 in Australia?\nNo. There aren’t any Australian airlines that have taken delivery of a Max 9 aircraft, nor do any international carriers fly the single-aisle plane designed for short- and medium-haul flights on Australian routes.\nVirgin Australia and Bonza currently operate the Max 8 aircraft – a slightly shorter version of the Max 9 – but as yet there are no directives that affect this model as it doesn’t feature the door plug in question.\nSo this won’t have any impact in Australia?\nFor now, airlines and Australia’s regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa), are watching developments overseas to see if the issue is isolated to just the Alaskan plane or the broader Max 9 model with the same door plug.\nIf investigators find an issue with the door component in question, it could have implications for Virgin Australia, which has 25 Max 10s (an even longer version of the aircraft) on order and due for delivery from next year.\n\n Related: US orders Boeing 737 Max 9 planes grounded after Alaska Airlines blowout \n\nIf broader concerns are flagged and regulators in the US and other countries take further action against Max 9s or other aircraft in the Max fleet, Casa would likely follow.\nIn 2019, after two fatal crashes involving the Boeing Max 8 within months, Casa followed foreign regulators in banning the planes from Australia despite no local airlines operating them at the time.\nWhy is this one incident getting so much attention?\nNot only are incidents like these rare in aviation, Boeing’s 737 Max generation of aircraft has been steeped in controversy since it first took to the skies commercially in 2017.\nAfter the two fatal Max 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019, all Max aircraft were grounded globally for almost two years while company engineers worked to identify and resolve the issue.\nThe Max is the fourth generation of the Boeing 737, a plane first flown commercially in 1968. Designed to compete with the Airbus A320Neo, the Max was seen as a modern update to bring a more fuel-efficient model to the 737 family while largely retaining the decades-old structure of the plane.\nThis approach appealed to airlines because pilots who already flew the 737 wouldn’t have to retrain to operate a Max. Boeing achieved the greater fuel efficiency in part due to heavier engines.\nHowever, crash investigators identified faults in the sensors and new flight control software to compensate for the heavier engines needed for the Max – software that had not been explained to pilots – as causing the planes to override pilots and plunge from the sky.\nBoeing was hit with US$2.5bn in fines and compensation, and is estimated to have lost tens of billions more in lost orders for planes. Casa has since deemed the Max 8 safe for operation in Australia.\nMore recently, in December 2023, Boeing asked airlines to inspect its 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder control system.\nAs a result of Friday’s incident, there are now fresh concerns of further design issues with the Max."

        "content": "BT is launching a programme to convert old street cabinets traditionally used for broadband and phone cables into electric vehicle charging points. The first conversion under the pilot scheme will take place within weeks in East Lothian, Scotland, before being expanded to more locations. The scheme is being run by the startup Etc, the digital incubation arm of the BT Group, and has been unveiled before the CES technology convention in Las Vegas. Research from BT has shown that two-thirds of Britons (60%) think EV charging infrastructure is inadequate. It found that 78% of petrol and diesel drivers said not being able to conveniently charge an EV was a barrier to getting one. The UK installed a record number of public electric car chargers in 2023 as the size of network of ultra-rapid chargers for longer journeys doubled. Almost 16,000 public chargers were installed in the year to 12 December, pushing the total above 53,200, according to the data company ZapMap. That represented a 43% increase on 2022, significantly faster than the last three years. Last year, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, delayed the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by five years, to 2035. Sales of electric cars flatlined in 2023, with the share of total registrations at 16.5%, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, compared with 16.6% in 2022. Tom Guy, the managing director of Etc, said: “Our new charging solution is a huge step in bringing EV charging kerbside and exploring how we can address key barriers customers are currently facing. “Working closely with local councils in Scotland and more widely across the UK, we are at a critical stage of our journey in tackling a very real customer problem that sits at the heart of our wider purpose to connect for good.” Engineers will retrofit the cabinets with a device that facilitates renewable energy to be shared to a charge point alongside the existing broadband service, with no need to create a new power connection."

        "content": "The billionaire boss of Bet365 pocketed more than £270m last year in another huge payday for the founder of the Stoke-on-Trent-based gambling company. Denise Coates, who set up Bet365 in a portable building in the Staffordshire city in 2000, received the bumper payout despite the firm making a £60m loss. She was paid a salary of £220.7m in the year to 26 March 2023, a £7m increase on her pay the year before, according to Bet365’s latest accounts filed at Companies House on Monday. As its controlling shareholder she is also entitled to at least 50% of the £100m dividend that was also paid for the year. The £270.6m combined annual salary and dividend payment is up from the total £260m she collected in 2022. It takes the total paid to Coates since 2016 to more than £1.7bn, according to calculations by the Guardian, and cements her position as one of the world’s best-paid people. While her £270m pay for 2023 is huge – and works out at more than £1m for every working day of the year – it is less than the record-breaking £466m she collected in 2020. In 2021, she collected £300m. She earned far more than the bosses of the biggest companies in the FTSE 100 index. Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of the drug company AstraZeneca, earned £15.3m in 2022, the latest year for which comparative statistics are available. Charles Woodburn, the boss of the arms manufacturer BAE Systems, was the second highest-paid, collecting £10.7m. In third place was Albert Manifold, the leader of the building supplies company CRH, who was paid £10.4m. The Coates family is ranked as the 16th richest in the UK with an estimated £8.8bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, which campaigns for restraint in excessive executive pay, said: “People deserve to be rewarded for innovation and success but there’s a question of what’s sensible and proportionate. Nobody becomes a multibillionaire in isolation from wider society. In this case, the wealth depends on money coming out of gamblers’ pockets, the efforts of thousands of staff, plus wider factors like people having some disposable income, a secure and reliable internet network or all the infrastructure that goes into staging sports events. “Ultimately, Britain’s prosperity depends on how the wealth our economy generates is shared. Pouring hundreds of millions of pounds more on top of billionaire fortunes every year isn’t a good way to maximise living standards, and it overvalues the contribution that the super-rich have made.” Bet365 collected roughly flat revenues of £3.4bn, while the business recorded a pre-tax loss of £60m in the year to March, including a £12.4m loss from its ownership of Stoke City football club. The group also made a £100m donation to The Denise Coates Foundation, a registered charity. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Coates built Bet365 into one of the biggest online gambling companies from the bookmaking business owned by her father, Peter, in Stoke-on-Trent. After graduating with a first-class degree in econometrics – the application of statistical methods to economic data – from the University of Sheffield, Coates expanded the family’s Provincial Racing chain to nearly 50 betting shops. As the millennium approached, she decided the future of betting was online and bought the Bet365.com domain on eBay for $25,000 (£19,000), a move that helped catapult her and her family up the UK wealth league. Coates was awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to the community and business, and has become known as the “patron of the Potteries” for her decision to continue to base Bet365 in Stoke, where it is the largest private-sector employer. She is building a £90m glass and steel mansion set in 21 hectares (52 acres) of Cheshire parkland. The house include an artificial lake, sunken tennis courts, stables, ornamental gardens, workers’ cottages and a boathouse. In December 2018, it emerged Coates spent £5.5m buying up hundreds of acres of farmland that surrounds her new futuristic home – designed by the Foster and Partners architecture practice – in order to maintain her privacy. She also planted 200 trees and erected a 2 metre security fence around the property. The revelation of her latest mega-payday came just days after research showed the bosses of Britain’s biggest companies made more money in the first three days of 2023 than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year."

        "content": "An oligarch who has supplied building materials to the Russian military machine and for construction in occupied areas of Ukraine is being assisted by Morgan Stanley and Allen & Overy in his attempt to gain control of a huge Russian oil asset, the Guardian can reveal. Sergey Kolesnikov, originally from Russia but now a Maltese citizen under its “golden passport” scheme is estimated to be worth $1.2bn (£940m) as a result of the building materials business he co-founded. Only Poland has imposed sanctions on the 51-year-old but Ukraine has included him on its list of people it wants the EU to use sanctions against. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, and Allen & Overy, one of the elite “magic circle” law firms headquartered in London, have been helping Kolesnikov as he attempts to take ownership of the Verbluzhye oilfield, said to contain 100m barrels of oil, in Astrakhan in southern Russia. While there is no suggestion that they have broken any laws or regulations, their work for Kolesnikov illustrates how blue chip companies continue to work with oligarchs and their businesses that have profited from the Russian defence industry and the invasion of Ukraine, despite international efforts to isolate the Putin regime and its beneficiaries. Kolesnikov’s Inflection Management company, which is registered in Cyprus, is one creditor of Astrakhan Oil Corporation (AOC), through a 2012 facility of loans of more than $70m negotiated by Morgan Stanley, which had a majority of shares in AOC’s subsidiary – the Russian drilling firm Southern Oil Company (UNK) – pledged as security. AOC fell behind on repayments in 2014 when the rouble crashed after Russia’s invasion of Crimea and Morgan Stanley is trying to help the creditors take a majority stake in UNK. The Russian courts have so far rejected the attempts – partly because of a law that forbids foreign ownership of strategic assets – and there are now proceedings taking place at the London court of international arbitration. During the Russian proceedings, an appeal court criticised a valuation of the UNK shares at one rouble (£0.01) by an expert witness put forward by Morgan Stanley, seeking to determine the price at which it could obtain the shares. Another court judgment noted that an Allen & Overy partner had given an opinion on Morgan Stanley’s claim but said that, given his position, he “was not an independent expert” and his firm “had an interest in achieving success for the client” (Morgan Stanley). Allen & Overy, now in the process of merging with the US law firm Shearman & Sterling, announced in March 2022 that it was closing its Moscow office due to the “illegal and senseless invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing humanitarian crisis”. In December 2022, Morgan Stanley said: “We are not entering any new business onshore in Russia and our activities in Russia are limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations.” Both firms declined to comment for this article. Kolesnikov’s TechnoNicol company has supplied Russian construction projects in Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, and in Mariupol, which was bombarded by Putin’s army for more than 80 days before being captured, as well as Russian defence companies. TechnoNicol products feature prominently in photographs in news reports illustrating reconstruction projects in occupied Ukraine. Other websites offer its materials for sale in Crimea as well as occupied Donetsk and Luhansk. The Proekt investigative media website, citing publicly available data, reported that TechnoNicol’s sales in Russia had skyrocketed since the start of the war, with profits 55 times higher in 2022 than the previous year. Russia has restricted access to details of military contracts but TechnoNicol won tenders to supply roofing, waterproofing and thermal insulation materials to 18 defence enterprises until at least 2018. Kolesnikov did not respond to a request to comment for this article. However, he previously told the German newspaper Taz that he could not assess whether businesses supplied by TechnoNicol were defence companies or not, while insisting he does not do business with the arms industry. He added that all orders were for civilian purposes and he had never sold products to the Russian armed forces or other groups active in the Ukrainian war. He did not deny that TechnoNicol products were being used in eastern Ukraine but stressed that it is not a construction company. In 2022, the Scottish government was criticised after it emerged that it had backed an upgrade to a factory in Stirling owned by Kolesnikov’s Inflection Management company with almost £500,000 of public money. The upgraded factory was unveiled by the then Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon."

        "content": "Gillian Woodward, 50, says her house has been “completely transformed for the better” by installing an air source heat pump. Woodward, a community nurse in north Wales, was “astounded” to discover that she was eligible for a government-backed means-tested grant that covered the whole cost of insulating and installing a heat pump in her home. “A lot of my friends have said they’re not sure about heat pumps,” says Woodward. “But the technology has improved a lot and satisfaction levels, even in old homes, are high. I thought it was worth the risk.”  Her experience chimes with the findings of a report by the thinktank Nesta last year that found satisfaction levels for heat pump users in Victorian or older properties were 83%, challenging the idea that the heating technology is only suited to those in newly built homes. The survey found that two-thirds of heat pump owners and 59% of gas boiler owners were satisfied even without extensive energy efficiency upgrades. Woodward’s 1880 two-bedroom end of terrace house, which had been awarded an EPC F rating, previously relied on a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) combination boiler. During the winter, Woodward used to get through a £75 gas bottle every 10 days, on top of monthly electricity costs of about £100 this time last year. “The costs of heating were astronomical even for the most minimal amount,” she says. The community nurse qualified for the Eco 4 Flex grant due to having a household income below £31,000 and living in a property with an EPC rating of D or lower. Woodward’s home needed a fair amount of insulation work, with all the external walls internally insulated, pipes and radiators replaced, and the loft insulation improved, a process she describes as “very invasive” but worthwhile.  “I’m overall paying less, the house is consistently warm and much greener,” Woodward said. “I absolutely love the system. The house is warmer to an actually incomparable degree.” She only completed her heat pump installation in autumn 2023 but is already seeing savings. In comparison with December 2022’s energy costs of about £325 between gas and electric, her electricity bill near the end of last year came to £230 for a much warmer home – and she expects her bills may fall further as she becomes accustomed to the settings. This is signalling engineer Tom Corkley’s second winter with an air source heat pump in his 1962 three-bed dormer bungalow in Staffordshire, after installing it in August 2022. “We knew we would need a new boiler in the next year or two and went for a heat pump instead because of the CO2 savings. Overall we’re very happy with the system and it has kept us warm even in cold weather,” says the 32-year-old, adding that he has replaced a few of the property’s radiators and his home already had cavity wall insulation and some loft insulation. Corkley explains he has had to make some adjustments to adapt to a heating system that works differently from the previous gas boiler. “It’s a different sort of heat and more comfortable overall. The key thing is to keep it on as long as possible in cold weather, including overnight. If you’re away it needs to either be left on at low level or started several days before returning. The lower flow temperatures mean it would take several days to warm the house from stone cold.” Two-thirds (67%) of heat pump owners and 59% of gas boiler owners are satisfied with running costs, according to Nesta, and Corkley says he has not seen a noticeable change in his overall energy costs after accounting for price rises. But he does not know if he will recoup the costs of installation – he spent £7,000 on top of his £5,000 government grant – “unless the price of electricity falls relative to gas”. Since Corkley installed the system, the government has increased heat pump grants to £7,500. Katy King, the deputy director of sustainable future at Nesta, says the thinktank’s research shows they have been largely popular with owners. “Heat pumps are a hit with people who have them installed. Three in four people are as, or more, happy with their heat pump compared with their previous heating system. Our research also found that high satisfaction with heat pumps was the same whether the house was a new-build or an older property. She adds that people who registered lower satisfaction tend to be those who have moved into a property which already has a heat pump, which she says suggests “they would benefit from more information on how to best use their heat pump”. However, Susan Black, who recently retired from the care sector, has faced issues since taking the plunge and investing in a heat pump in late 2014 in an early 18th-century cottage in Herefordshire that she renovated with her partner. “We wanted to future-proof the cottage, having rescued it from complete dereliction in 2012,” Black, 67, says. “We have no access to mains gas and wanted to reduce our impact on the environment.” Despite Black undertaking insulation work as part of the renovation, the air source heat pump’s running costs have been high, and as the cottage is Grade II-listed, they are not allowed to have standard double glazing. After a thermal imaging survey, they retrofitted the home with further insulation after the heat pump was installed, which has helped cut energy usage, but they now rely on a wood burning stove for heating, the pump for hot water, and solar panels for some of their electricity. “I think [the issue] is the insulation and the fact electricity is very expensive – we found unless we had it cranked up to an enormously high level, it doesn’t feel warm. We’re in a rural area, we get power cuts – we had one last year that lasted three days. That’s another factor in us not wanting to completely rely on a heat pump. “[The campaign group] Insulate Britain have a point – we need to insulate first and then convert, because otherwise there will be a huge backlash against green measures.” Switching to a heat pump has delivered tremendous savings to others. Like 75% of heat pump owners surveyed by Nesta, Kristin Warry, 54, lives in a rural area, and has seen her monthly electricity direct debit halve from £363 in the winter of 2021 to £187 last month since she ditched her electric boiler for a heat pump system two years ago. Her three-bedroom thatched cottage in Wiltshire is made up of three sections that roughly date back to the 1770s, 1900s and 1980s. “We are very happy to have a system that has saved us so much, and is on all the time. [For costs] to be down is brilliant, but we really didn’t expect that much of a saving. Having no gas pipes makes this a big opportunity for rural dwellers like ourselves,” she says, explaining that as a recipient of disability benefits, she received a £10,000 grant but had to pay just under £6,000 herself for the installation. “We were lighting fires on cold days and wrapping up before – these days we just have heating on all the time. I’m disabled and so it’s been rather good for me,” Warry adds. “It’s a lot warmer, particularly at night. Before we had one or two warm rooms, but now the whole house is warm.”"

        "content": "Britain’s largest manufacturers believe the UK is increasing its competitiveness as a global hub for manufacturing, despite high energy costs, worker shortages and political instability holding back progress. In a crunch period for the economy before the general election, the manufacturing trade body Make UK and the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said industry bosses were growing more confident about the sector’s prospects, but “headwinds of sustained economic challenges” still remained. Publishing the findings of a survey of more than 200 senior manufacturing executives, Make UK said a majority believed Britain was becoming a more competitive place to locate industrial production than 12 months ago. Almost a third said the UK was increasing its competitiveness against Germany and France, while more than a quarter believed Britain was moving ahead of Spain and Italy. However, a larger share of companies said the UK was losing ground against the US, China and India. The findings come after a period of heightened instability through the Covid pandemic, Brexit and the shock from soaring energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with industry bosses hopeful that 2024 will be steadier amid easing inflation and the prospect of Bank of England interest rate cuts. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, said: “We are now seeing some hope that conditions may be improving, amid a more supportive and stable policy environment, but this must be cemented within a long-term industrial strategy.” While manufacturing output in the UK has been shrinking for 17 consecutive months amid the impact from higher borrowing costs and weaker consumer demand, activity has fallen deeper in several EU countries, including Germany, where the economy is in recession. UK firms had welcomed measures in Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement to offer permanent investment reliefs, saying the tax breaks could encourage investment in Britain. However, bosses have also roundly criticised ministers for the lack of an industrial strategy after years of flip-flopping on policy – including Rishi Sunak watering down the UK’s net zero promises last year.   Related: British exporters call on government to ease post-Brexit trade frictions with EU   Businesses have also warned that Brexit is damaging the competitiveness of the British economy, with a survey of more than 700 UK exporters by the British Chambers of Commerce last month showing that almost two-thirds found selling to the EU – the country’s largest export market – had become harder in the past year. The Make UK findings come as separate research from the accountancy firm Deloitte found optimism was rising among the chief financial officers (CFOs) of the UK’s largest companies. According to its latest quarterly CFO survey, which is monitored by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the economy, a net 11% of finance leaders were more optimistic about the prospects for their business than three months earlier – significantly above average levels. Ian Stewart, Deloitte’s chief economist, said: “These findings may seem at odds with recent economic news, particularly a contraction in third-quarter GDP and forecasts of sluggish UK growth in 2024. “But, while the pace of growth softened in 2023, activity proved more resilient than expected, with unemployment at low levels, corporate profitability holding up and an absence of stress in financial markets. Crucially, inflation has fallen sharply since the summer, bolstering expectations of earlier interest rate reductions.”"

        "content": "US aviation investigators were on the ground in Oregon on Sunday trying to figure out what caused a door panel to blow out of a brand new Boeing passenger jet just minutes after takeoff, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing with a hole “the size of a refrigerator” in the side of the plane. The American jet maker was facing fresh scrutiny as regulators temporarily grounded the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft after a section of a plugged exit door on an Alaska Airlines flight detached 16,000ft (4,877 meters) above Portland, Oregon, on Friday with 171 passengers and six crew on board. The weeks-old plane had been modified, requiring fewer emergency exits because it had fewer seats. But investigators – who solicited the public’s help tracking down the Alaska Airlines plane door, which remained missing Sunday – said that initial findings do not suggest a widespread flaw with the Boeing Max 9 aircraft. “We’ll look at the pressurization system, we’ll look at the door, the hinges,” Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said at a news conference. “Do we suspect that there is an overall design problem with this plane based on previous accidents involving Boeing Max? At this time, no.” On Sunday, thousands of passengers, mostly in the US, faced flight cancellations that are expected to continue into next week as airlines called in inspectors to comply with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) order. No one was seriously injured during Friday’s emergency landing. Still, the close call has raised fresh safety concerns about Boeing planes, which took place five years after two fatal accidents left 346 people dead and the US company’s reputation in tatters. The fatal crashes took place within a few months of each other in 2018 and 2019. Those involved Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. All Max aircraft were then grounded globally for almost two years while company engineers worked to identify the problem – which turned out to be hardware malfunctions and badly designed software that caused the planes to override pilots and plunge from the sky. In December, Boeing asked airlines to inspect its 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder control system. Friday’s episode over Portland involved a different model. The 737 Max 9 is now Boeing’s largest single-aisle aircraft with a seating capacity of up to 220. But most airlines have chosen fewer seats, which means the jet’s optional extra door is plugged – or covered. It was a section of the covered “extra” door in the fuselage – the main body of the plane which includes the cabin, cockpit and cargo compartments – which blew-out midair. Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, manufactured the fuselage. But Boeing completed the complex, two-tier installation process at its plant just outside Seattle, Washington. Investigators are expected to examine both factories for potential flaws in design, manufacturing and installation, according to sources cited by Reuters. “The assumption is that it was installed or rigged incorrectly,” one source reportedly said. Neither Boeing nor Spirit have commented. Door plugs have been used to adapt aircraft and offer flexible seating across the industry for years. The altitude at which the door panel blew out suggests an issue with pressure, according to Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA official. “It happened at a lower altitude than I would expect, which kind of tells me that the door was not doing its job in keeping the pressure inside of the fuselage,” Guzzetti told NBC’s Today show. Passengers were shaken up Friday by the near miss. Things weren’t worse likely because the blowout happened before the plane reached cruising altitude, and passengers were still seated with their lap belts fastened. “Think about what happens when you’re in cruise. Everybody is up and walking, folks don’t have seatbelts on,” Homendy said. “We could have ended up with something so much more tragic.” No one was sitting directly in the window seat next to the covered exit door. But a teenage boy and his mother were in the middle and aisle seats. “The son’s shirt was completely blown off and his body was completely red, I’m assuming due to the irritation of the wind,” Elizabeth Le, a passenger, told NBC. Le, 20, said she heard “an extremely loud pop”, looked up and saw a large hole on the wall of the plane a couple of rows away. Another passenger said the gap was “as wide as a refrigerator”. About 215 Boeing Max 9 airplanes are operating globally, according to Cirium, an aviation data provider. Two US airlines – United and Alaska – account for 70% of the jets in service. Other operators include Panama’s Copa Airlines, Aeromexico, Turkish Airlines, FlyDubai and IcelandAir. The FAA has grounded and ordered inspections of only the 737 Max 9 aircraft which have been modified to lower seating capacity and therefore include a covered cabin exit door. In a statement on Friday, Boeing said that safety was its top priority, and its technical team was supporting the NTSB investigation. It added: “We agree with and fully support the FAA’s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.” According to the Aviation Safety Network, an unofficial database compiled from government sources, more than 4,900 people have died in major incidents involving planes from the Boeing 737 family since it was launched in the late 1960s."

        "published_date": "2024-01-07T18:06:00+00:00",
        "content": "What is the Horizon IT scandal? Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office relentlessly pursued operators of sub-post offices across the UK for alleged theft, fraud and false accounting based on information from its Horizon IT system installed in the late 1990s. That was despite knowing that from at least 2010 onwards that there were faults in the centralised accounting software. In total, about 3,500 branch owner-operators were wrongly accused of taking money from their businesses, with more than 900 prosecuted by the Post Office despite protesting their innocence and raising issues with the software in their defence. The scandal is frequently described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. What harm did it cause? Hundreds of sub-post office operators ended up with criminal records and punishments ranging from having to do community service and wear electronic tags to being jailed. Many were left struggling financially or even bankrupt following convictions. Even those who did not go to court had to drum up money to cover nonexistent shortfalls. Victims and their families were severely hit by stress, and in many cases illness, with the scandal linked to at least four suicides. For years the Post Office, which has the power to investigate and prosecute without the need for police involvement, continued to defend itself against accusations and press reports highlighting problems with the IT system, developed by Japan’s Fujitsu, including through legal means. In 2019, a group of post office operators won a high court case in which their convictions were ruled wrongful and the Horizon IT system was ruled to be at fault. In 2021, the ruling was upheld on appeal, quashing the convictions of some workers who were wrongly accused of committing crimes, paving the way for compensation. However, even since the computer system was found to be defective, the Post Office has still opposed a number of appeals by operators. What kind of justice have victims got since? By last month, 142 appeal case reviews had been completed out of 900 people convicted during the scandal, with 93 convictions overturned and 54 upheld, withdrawn or refused permission to appeal. A total of £24m has been paid out in relation to overturned convictions. However, there has been widespread criticism that the Post Office has been dragging its feet with delays to payments. Dozens of victims have died before they could receive any compensation. It has also come under fire for further blunders, such as tax being charged on compensation and offering bosses about £1.6m in bonuses, with handling of the Horizon inquiry one of four “metrics” on which payments were awarded. The overturned convictions process is one of three different compensation schemes that have been established as the scandal developed, and last September ministers promised that every branch owner-operator whose wrongful conviction had been overturned would receive £600,000 in compensation from the government. More than £130m has so far been paid out to about 2,500 Post Office workers across the three schemes. However, last month it emerged that the Post Office had almost halved the amount set aside for payouts as fewer owner-operators than expected had won or brought appeals. What about those who pursued the prosecutions? To date no Post Office staff have been punished for the scandal. On Friday, the Metropolitan police confirmed for the first time that the Post Office is under criminal investigation over “potential fraud offences” committed during the scandal. The Met is already investigating two former Fujitsu experts, who were witnesses in the trials, for perjury and perverting the course of justice.  Why is the scandal back in the headlines? The independent public inquiry, established in September 2020 and made statutory the following June, has brought further revelations. The hearings led by retired judge Sir Wyn Williams, featuring testimony and internal documents from former Post Office management, members of legal teams involved at the time, investigators and victims, are expected to be completed some time this year. Campaigners have also highlighted other shocking aspects of the story, including documents that Post Office prosecutors classified branch owner-operators by ethnicity, using a racist term for black workers. An ITV drama broadcast last week, Mr Bates v the Post Office, highlighting the story of Alan Bates leading the fight for justice for him and his fellow sub-post office operators, was widely watched and has renewed public outrage and calls for action against those involved. What happens next? Rishi Sunak said on Sunday that ministers were considering plans to exonerate post office operators whose lives have been ruined. The prime minister also confirmed that the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, could strip the Post Office of its private prosecution powers. There have been calls for former Post Office boss Paula Vennells, who was chief executive for much of the period during which the postmasters were wrongly pursued, to be stripped of her CBE. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, has also come under increasing criticism for his lack of action when he was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, when the software issues started coming to light. In May 2010, Davey refused to meet Bates, saying he did not believe seeing the campaigning post office operator “would serve any purpose”. Davey, who did later meet Bates in October 2010, has said he regretted not doing more at the time and claimed that Post Office executives had blocked him from meeting campaigners. In the meantime, the Post Office continues to use the Horizon system. The loss-making Post Office has asked the government for £252m of funding to keep it afloat, including money to cover the cost of updating the controversial IT system, which it still uses with support from developers Fujitsu."

        "content": "A strike that threatened to halt all London Underground services for the next four days has been called off. The RMT union announced that it had suspended its planned action after talks with Transport for London (TfL), after the mayor of London apparently made new funds available.  The strikes were expected to stop almost all tube services and cause travel chaos in the capital. However, TfL warned that there may still be some disruption on Monday morning because of the last-minute suspension of the strikes. Members of the RMT started rolling industrial action over pay on Friday, with stoppages by engineers and network control staff, but the major impact was due from Monday when frontline staff in stations, train operations and signalling joined the strikes. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “Following further positive discussions today, the negotiations on a pay deal for our London Underground members can now take place on an improved basis and mandate with significant further funding for a settlement being made available. “This significantly improved funding position means the scheduled strike action will be suspended with immediate effect and we look forward to getting in to urgent negotiations with TfL in order to develop a suitable agreement and resolution to the dispute.” RMT members had voted to strike over a pay rise due in April 2023. TfL has offered a 5% increase, but rises have traditionally been linked to RPI inflation which was running substantially higher last year. The union argued that TfL could afford more, pointing to a £40,000 salary rise to £395,000 for the transport commissioner, Andy Lord, when his role was confirmed as permanent in June. Unions have also objected to plans to freeze salary bands for low-paid roles, and are arguing for the restoration of some travel benefits. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the strikes would have cost the hospitality industry £50m, and the suspension “shows what can be achieved by engaging and working with trade unions and transport staff, rather than working against them”. However, Khan’s 11th-hour intervention appears to have been a surprise to TfL negotiators. A TfL spokesperson said: “Last week we discussed our pay offer extensively with the three trade unions that had rejected it, making clear that TfL cannot afford any more. This remains the case. “Today, we were made aware that the mayor was able to provide additional funds to enable discussions with the unions to continue. We have all consistently made clear that strike action is bad for everyone and would have a negative impact on the city as it recovers from the pandemic.” The train drivers union Aslef had accepted the 5% offer but sources indicated that it may now reframe its demands for an inflation-linked deal. A third rail union, the TSSA, has announced it would ballot for industrial action, while Unite had yet to accept the deal. Tube workers received an 8.4% pay rise in 2022 as part of a four-year index-linked deal struck before inflation soared. TfL’s finances were ravaged by the pandemic lockdowns and changing work patterns, with more than 70% of its budget normally coming through fares, mainly from tube passengers. Last month, ministers granted a further £250m to TfL for investment, including buying new Yorkshire-made Piccadilly line trains, but the capital is no longer getting any central funding for day-to-day transport. Fares in London are expected to rise by about 5% in March, although the exact increase has yet to be fixed by the mayor."
