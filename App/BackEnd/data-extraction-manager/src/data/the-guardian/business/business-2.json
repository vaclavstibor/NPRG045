The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output ‚Äì the technical definition of a recession. Official confirmation of a recession will embarrass the prime minister before a general election expected this year, having made growing the economy one of his five flagship priorities for government.  Interactive  Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Sunak‚Äôs promise was ‚Äúin tatters‚Äù after years of economic stagnation under the Conservatives.  She said:  ‚ÄúThis is Rishi Sunak‚Äôs recession, and the news will be deeply worrying for families and business across Britain.‚Äù  The ONS said growth over the course of 2023 as a whole was estimated at 0.1%, the weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis, excluding the economic collapse in 2020 during the Covid pandemic.

Germany‚Äôs DIHK chambers of industry and commerce warned on Thursday that Europe‚Äôs biggest economy will shrink by 0.5% this year, in a second year of recession. This will mean Germany‚Äôs worst downturn in two decades, and only the second time in Germany‚Äôs post-war history where the economy contracted for two years in a row, Reuters reports. A DIHK poll of more than 27,000 companies showed that of those surveyed, 35% expect business to deteriorate in the next 12 months with only 14% expecting an improvement, as high energy prices, bureaucracy, a skilled workers shortage and weak domestic demand weigh on economic output. DIHK says:  ‚ÄúThe bad mood among companies is becoming more entrenched.‚Äù      2.42pm GMT  Common Wealth: GB Energy can make energy transition cheaper  Rachel Reeves was right to stress the economic potential of Great British Energy today, says Mathew Lawrence, Director of think tank Common Wealth. Lawrence says:  Direct public investment is the fastest and most reliable route to cheap renewable power. With sky high electricity costs a barrier to economic recovery, and a key competitive weakness, secure and low cost clean energy is a key step toward a stronger economy. But maximising its potential will require going further ‚Äî significantly building on Labour‚Äôs plans to deliver more public investment in clean power this decade.  Common Wealth have also analysed the financial immpact of GB Energy. And they‚Äôve concluded that it could save up to ¬£1bn on interest savings alone compared to using corporate borrowing to fund renewable energy infrastructure. In a new report, they say:  The report calculates that renewable investment financed out of Labour‚Äôs announced ¬£8.3bn initial capitalisation of GB Energy would save between ¬£125-208m per year on interest alone, for every year that the debt was being serviced, relative to if that investment was financed by corporate borrowing.   ‚ö°Ô∏è is the linchpin of delivering the üü¢transition + broader economic goals: still a major source of CO2, with gas ‚ö°Ô∏è predominant; ‚ö°Ô∏è is the basis of decarbonisation of other sectors; + ‚ö°Ô∏èis a core economic input + affordable ‚ö°Ô∏èa fundamental human right. pic.twitter.com/WvB7Ywhtl0‚Äî Common Wealth (@Cmmonwealth) February 15, 2024      2.37pm GMT    I really don't understand the level of denialism on the hole the UK finds itself it.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4‚Äôs World at One, Lord Lamont said:  ‚ÄúI think people ought to be realistic about this. We have an almost perfect storm. We are coming through it, I think there is light at the end of the tunnel now and we just need to hold our nerve.‚Äù  Lamont does have form for economic optimism. Back in October 1991, he was ridiculed for claiming to see green shoots of recovery sprouting ‚Äì though the recovery did indeed start the next year. As Mrs Lamont apparently pointed out, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get green shoots in the autumn.‚Äù  Updated at 2.24pm GMT    2.08pm GMT   Back in the UK, Michael Kitson, associate professor in International Macroeconomics at the University of Cambridge‚Äôs Judge Business School, says the government lacks a coherent policy for economic growth. Following Britain‚Äôs drop into a technical recession today, Kitson says:  ‚ÄúAlthough the importance of the latest figures should not be exaggerated (especially as they are often revised), the data adds to the broader picture of economic malaise in the UK. According to the IMF, the UK economy is expected to grow by only 0.6% in 2024, well below the growth rate of 1.5% for all the advanced economies. The Bank of England may give the economy a minor boost by reducing interest rates in 2024, but it must be emphasised that the Bank‚Äôs remit is to control inflation and not to stimulate growth.  Also, the Government has no coherent policy to grow the economy although it may resort to some tax cutting in advance of the general election to curry favour with the voters.‚Äù      1.38pm GMT   Over in the US, spending in shops, bars and restaurants has fallen more sharply than expected. US retail and food services sales dropped by 0.8% month-on-month in January, a rather larger fall than the 0.2% decline which economists expected. This may show that consumer demand in the world‚Äôs largest economy is weakening, in the face of high interest rates.  OUCH!  *US RETAIL SALES DECREASED 0.8% IN JAN.; EST. -0.2% *US JAN.

Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, says this shows investors are neither shocked nor concerned at today‚Äôs GDP figures. Mui says:  It is true the optics are not great, but against the backdrop of a tight labour market with unemployment rate of 3.8%, the UK economy hardly falling off a cliff. We have always felt that the UK is more susceptible to economic vulnerability due to its interest rate sensitivity. 2024 is unlikely to be a smooth ride for the UK economy as more homeowners are remortgaging into significantly higher interest rates. That said, there are also reasons for optimism due to the prospects of rate cuts later in the year as disinflation continues. Wages are now outpacing inflation which should give employees more purchasing power. Home prices are rising again monthly, defying gloomy predictions.      1.11pm GMT   Bank of England policymaker Megan Greene has said she wants to see further evidence that inflation is fading, before considering voting to cut interest rates. Greene is one of six BoE policymakers who voted to leave rates on hold this month, having previously voted to raise borrowing costs. Speaking at ratings agency Fitch today, Greene predicts that monetary policy will remain at restrictive levels for some time, to force inflation down to the 2% target [it remained at 4% in January]. Greene says:  Given recent developments in demand and inflation, it‚Äôs clear that monetary policy is restrictive in the UK. But in light of the persistence of UK wage and services price pressures, which stand out in international comparisons, I think policy will need to remain restrictive for some time in order for inflation to sustainably return to target.  Recent signs of persistence starting to ease are encouraging, and I judge that current policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to target in the mediumterm. I would need to see further evidence that inflation persistence is less embedded than previously feared before I would consider voting to loosen policy.  Greene also explains that the UK has faced at ‚Äúdouble whammy‚Äù ‚Äì a terms of trade shock even larger and longer lasting than in the EU, alongside a tight labour market like in the US. That means that ‚Äúinflation persistence‚Äù is a greater threat in the UK. She also points out that shocks from Brexit and the pandemic have left UK supply much weaker than in the US in recent years.     1.03pm GMT  NIESR: economy will grow this quarter  NIESR, the economic forecasting institute, have predicted the UK economy will return to growth in the current quarter. They forecast GDP will rise by 0.2% in the January-March quarter.  ‚ö°Ô∏èOUT NOW ‚ö°Ô∏è Our latest #GDP Tracker suggests that UK GDP is set to grow by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024 after two consecutive quarters of contraction üìà‚¨áÔ∏èRead here in fullüîì‚¨áÔ∏è#UKGDP #GDPgrowth #UKeconomy #EconTwitter https://t.co/sKGblihjYQ pic.twitter.com/wrZNuQ8OYo‚Äî National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) February 15, 2024  Paula Bejarano Carbo, NIESR economist, says:  ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs ONS data indicate that GDP fell by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, marking two quarterly consecutive falls in GDP. By the standard metric, this means that the UK economy was in a shallow recession in the second half of last year. However, this metric is both arbitrary and not greatly informative: the state of the UK economy is better described by the fact that GDP fell between the first quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023. Further, GDP per head remains lower than pre-Covid.  The broader picture of flatlining growth and its adverse implications for living standards in the long-term should dominate today‚Äôs headlines, rather than technicalities.‚Äù   Updated at 1.54pm GMT    12.53pm GMT   ‚ÄúSerious government investment‚Äù in green industries, public services, housing and skills are needed to fight the recession, says Dr. Lydia Prieg, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation (NEF).  This government‚Äôs longstanding failure to invest means that the UK will struggle to rebound.

This government‚Äôs long standing failure to invest in the economy combined with the Bank of England‚Äôs panicked interest rate rises have caused serious damage. Ordinary people are suffering the effects of these decisions, with low wages and falling standards of living likely to plague us for years. To combat this we need a drastic change in direction and serious government investment in green industries, public services, housing and skills. .‚Äù   \"It's very difficult to see how we'll emerge from this slump and boost living standards if we don't see a proper investment strategy from government.\"@LydiaPrieg on what the government needs to do get the UK out of our economic slump on @BBCNews pic.twitter.com/w7Z0Xt0STK‚Äî NEF (@NEF) February 15, 2024      12.50pm GMT    'Rishi Sunak has now put our economy into reverse... it is the British people who will pay the price'After figures showed the UK slipped into a recession at the end of 2023, Rachel Reeves said the PM is 'completely out of touch with the realities on the ground' pic.twitter.com/F1xw96TPcv‚Äî ITV News (@itvnews) February 15, 2024      12.47pm GMT   Analysis by the UK economist for the jobs site Indeed, Jack Kennedy, makes the important point that the labour market is still not where the Bank of England thinks it should be. Kennedy says the GDP figures showing a recession in the second half of 2023 will be a side issue for the central bank, which is much more focused on the prices that services companies are charging, which has shown no sign of decreasing by much, and the latest wage growth figures. ‚ÄúFigures from the ONS was higher than expected, while data from the Indeed Wage Tracker shows that annual growth in advertised pay for new hires was running at 6.4% in January,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThough down from last year‚Äôs peak above 7%, it‚Äôs well above equivalent measures for the euro area (3.9%) and US (3.6%).  ‚ÄúWith labour supply constraints appearing more of an issue in the UK than elsewhere, stubborn pay pressures indicate why the Bank of England may need to maintain high rates longer than the ECB and Fed.‚Äù      12.25pm GMT   Rachel Reeves has ‚Äòrejected entirely‚Äô the suggestion there is little difference between what Labour and the Conservatives are offering the electorate. Asked what specifically she would do differently, compared to what‚Äôs happened over the last 18 months, Reeves cites several key parts of Labour‚Äôs plan.  Reforms to planning system to get Britain building ‚Äì freeing up ¬£200bn of projects that are waiting for connection to the energy grid. A new National Wealth Fund, with a ¬£7.3bn endowment, and GB Energy with just over ¬£8bn, will invest in jobs and industries of the future ‚Äì green steel, hudrogen, carbon capture and storage, floating offshore wind. Reforms to the apprentiship levy to help firms train the next generation of workers A modern industrial strategy      12.19pm GMT   Q: How would Labour increase productivity among the economically inactive? Rachel Reeves says this is a huge challenge, and that the UK is an outlier in failing to get people back to work after the pandemic. Many people are on hold because they are in the record-long NHS waiting list ‚Äì that needs to be tackled, she says. Scrapping the non-dom tax status will help fund two million more NHS appointments each year to clear the backlog, Reeves adds.     12.16pm GMT   Rachel Reeves has criticised Jeremy Hunt for ‚Äúproviding a running commentary on his own budget‚Äù. Reeves tells reporters in London that she has never seen anything like it. She says:  It is dangerous and it is very misguided, and I would urge him to stop this because it creates the uncertainty that we really don‚Äôt need.  Last month in Davos, the chancellor dropped a clear hint that there could be fresh tax cuts in March‚Äôs budget.   Related: Jeremy Hunt hints at voter-friendly tax giveaway in March budget    But then, at the start of this month, Hunt said he probably wouldn‚Äôt have the same scope for tax cuts as he had in last year‚Äôs autumn statement.     12.07pm GMT   Q: How will you stop ‚ÄúRishi‚Äôs recession‚Äù becoming ‚ÄúRachel‚Äôs recession‚Äù? Reeves insists the prime minister must own the downturn, as he‚Äôs been in charge since autumn 2022. The economy is now smaller than when Sunak became PM, she says. And she points out that many businesses have helped Labour draw up its plans for growth.     11.53am GMT  Reeves: Don't need recession to bring down inflation  Q: Would you have been prepared to induce a recession to tackle inflation, and if not, what would you have done differently as chancellor? Rachel Reeves says she doesn‚Äôt buy the argument that you need a recession to bring down inflation. She points out that the UK still has the highest inflation in the G7, while its likely that the UK and Japan are the only countries that fell into recession at the end of 2023. She tells reporters in London:  Other countries are doing an awful lot better at controlling inflation while also managing to grow their economy.   Updated at 12.09pm GMT    11.51am GMT   Q: What‚Äôs Labour‚Äôs plan for growth, now you have dropped the ¬£28bn a year green energy investment plan? Rachel Reeves says Labour‚Äôs plan for a national wealth fund and Great British Energy will drive growth in the economy, providing investment alongside the private sector. She says it was welcome that so many businesses said last week that joint investment is needed, along with planning reforms.   Related: Labour cuts ¬£28bn green investment pledge by half       11.46am GMT   Rachel Reeves then takes questions from reporters at her press conference in London. Q: Do you recognise that today‚Äôs recession is relatively mild, compared to the pandemic and the financial crisis? Showing her economic background, Reeves replies crisply that the definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.  The economy contracted by 0.1% in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4. These are worse numbers than economists had been predicting. This is a recession.  Reeves adds that we didn‚Äôt need these numbers to know that families are struggling through an enormous cost of living crisis, and businesses are struggling as well. She continues:  As [businessman] Stuart Rose said on the radio this morning, if it quacks like a recession, it is a recession. This is most certainly a recession.      11.40am GMT   Rachel Reeves says Labour‚Äôs economic plan is based on stability, investment and reform. Stability will come from strong fiscal rules, robust economic institutions, and a fully-costed and funded manifesto, she says. Investment will include partnerships with private sector to ‚Äòsteam ahead‚Äô in industries of the future, and a new national wealth fund to invest alongside business in automotive sector, ports and steel. Plus Great British Energy ‚Äì Labour‚Äôs plan for a new, publicly-owned clean energy company. Reform means taking on vested interests to get Britain building again, helping working people develop skills, a genuine living wage, and cutting the NHS backlog to get people back to work.     11.32am GMT   Rachel Reeves then highlights the economic challenges facing UK families. She points out that the average British family is 20% worse off than their German counterparts One in three working age families have less than ¬£1,000 in savings. Typical family renewing their mortgage this year will pay an extra ¬£240 each month. Three million people‚Äôs fixed-rate mortgages will end this year, and face higher borrowing costs due to the ‚ÄúTory mortgage bombshell‚Äù     11.20am GMT   Rishi Sunak claims he has a plan, but the plan is not working, Rachel Reeves adds. Taking aim at the PM, she tells reporters:  He claims that the economy has turned a corner, but the economy is shrinking. He claims he doesn‚Äôt want to take us back to square one, but we are going backwards. The prime minister‚Äôs claims are in tatters. The cornerstone of his leadership has been shattered. The promise to grow the economy has been broken.      11.17am GMT  Reeves: Britain remains trapped in a spiral of economic decline  Labour‚Äôs shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is warning that Britain is trapped in a spiral of economic decline. Giving a press conference in London now, Reeves says this morning‚Äôs drop into recession is ‚Äúdeeply worrying news‚Äù for families who are struggling to make ends meet, and for businesses too. Reeves points out that today‚Äôs GDP data is provisional, and may change (the ONS regularly updates its data), but adds:  It is absolutely clear that Britain remains trapped in a spiral of economic decline.  Reeves also points out the GDP per head (a measure of living standards) fell in every quarter last year (as covered at 7.58am). She says people didn‚Äôt need today‚Äôs GDP data to know that the economy wasn‚Äôt working. But, they ‚Äúshine a spotlight‚Äù on the scale of that failure, she insists, adding:  These numbers shine a spotlight on the scale of that failure. The confirmation of recession exposes a government and a prime minister completely out of touch with the realities on the ground.      11.09am GMT  Labour: This is Rishi‚Äôs recession  Labour are keen to pin the recession on Rishi Sunak, with a new advert contrasting the PM‚Äôs claim that the economy has ‚Äúturned the corner‚Äù with this morning‚Äôs bad economic news:   This is Rishi‚Äôs recession and it‚Äôs working people who will pay the price. pic.twitter.com/h0OGJ7cGT7‚Äî The Labour Party (@UKLabour) February 15, 2024      10.58am GMT  EC cuts growth and inflation forecasts  Over in Brussels, the European Commission has cut its growth forecasts for this year. The EC now expects the eurozone to only grow by 0.8% in 2024, down from an earlier forecast of 1.2%. The wider European Union is expected to grow by 0.9%, a cut from 1.3%. The Commission says:  After narrowly avoiding a technical recession in the second half of last year, prospects for the EU economy in the first quarter of 2024 remain weak. However, economic activity is still expected to accelerate gradually this year. As inflation continues to abate, real wage growth and a resilient labour market should support a rebound in consumption.  This weaker growth means the EC has cut its inflation forecasts too. Consumer price inflation, which hit 5.4% in 2023, is now expected to drop to 2.7% this year, not the 3.2% forecast in November. It is then seen slowing to 2.2% in 2025. The EC says:  Lower-than-expected inflation outturns in recent months, lower energy commodity prices and weaker economic momentum set inflation on a steeper downward path than anticipated in the Autumn Forecast. In the near term, however, the expiry of energy support measures across Member States and higher shipping costs following trade disruptions in the Red Sea are set to exert some upward price pressures, without derailing the process of declining inflation.      10.42am GMT   Today‚Äôs GDP report shows there was another slump in UK homebuilding at the end of last year. Output from new construction work fell by 5.0% in the October-December quarter, including an 8% drop in private housing ‚Äì the fifth quarterly drop in a row. Repair and maintenance work grew by 4%, resulting in a 1.3% drop in overall construction output in Q4.   Construction is estimated to have fallen 1.3% in the 3mths to Dec 2023 compared with the 3mths to Sep 2023. New work ‚¨áÔ∏è by 5.0% over the period, while repair & maintenance was ‚¨ÜÔ∏è by 4.0%.

Yesterday‚Äôs inflation report, showing prices rising slightly slower than expected, could also give the BoE some confidence to cut borrowing costs. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says:  Coming hot on the heels of yesterday‚Äôs inflation report that saw both headline and core CPI move sharply lower for the month of January, we are seeing a perfect storm build that puts the Bank of England in a prime position to cut rates in the coming months. Concerningly, we have also seen UK GDP per head continue to trend lower, with the tepid economic growth seen over recent years only coming about through an increase in the population rather than any improvement in the economy per se.   #UK economy slipped into recession dragged by private, gov. consumption & net trade vs. capex surgeFlat growth in near term on cumulative tightening effect before modest pick-up in year-end & 2025=> further evidence for earlier #BoE start of monetary policy easing in May! pic.twitter.com/QWxGqSXpQW‚Äî Nikolay Markov (@MarkoNikolay) February 15, 2024  Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, points out that the UK stock market was slightly higher this morning, amid recession-driven rate cut hopes.  ‚ÄúConfirmation that the UK is in recession has done nothing to knock UK stocks off course. An economy pushing through mud is not new news and if anything, it might encourage the Bank of England to think harder about cutting interest rates to avoid further economic deterioration.  That‚Äôs certainly how the market views the situation as UK equities ploughed ahead.‚Äù  But Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, argues that the BoE won‚Äôt be bounced into early rate cuts by the technical recession.  The Bank of England obviously won‚Äôt be swayed by the technical recession, as Governor Bailey alluded to earlier this week, but weaker household spending may suggest demand isn‚Äôt as strong as they anticipated. We‚Äôll get another update on that tomorrow from the January retail sales figures. With inflation expected to fall to target in the second quarter, maybe even further after this week‚Äôs readings, the debate around rate cuts could intensify earlier than they would have otherwise thought. Slower wage growth would obviously help that along greatly.      10.07am GMT   Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says Britain is now in the ‚Äúslow to no growth post-Brexit‚Äù world, following its drop into recession. He writes:  The adage of voters getting the government they deserve seems frivolous, but this is the slow to no growth post-Brexit alternate universe we find ourselves in despite prime minister Sunak‚Äôs failed pledge to grow the economy. Today‚Äôs twin by-elections will show whether the Tories can defend their seats or whether voters really have had enough.‚Äù  Voters could point out that they haven‚Äôt had a chance to vote for Sunak at a general election yet. The majority did, of course, plump for Brexit in 2016 ‚Äì a decision which means Britain‚Äôs economy is 5% smaller than it would have been if the country had chosen to stay in the European Union, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs this week [see Monday‚Äôs liveblog for full details].  British GDP is 5 percent lower as a result of Brexit calculate Goldman Sachs, stripping UK economy of any dynamism. It will get worse. It is now vital the damage is recognised - and remedied. As Brexit damage persists,¬†a tale of two competing strategieshttps://t.co/ryaWZ0L0Bv‚Äî Will Hutton (@williamnhutton) February 14, 2024   Updated at 10.14am GMT    9.52am GMT   The pound has not really been hit by the UK‚Äôs fall into recession. Sterling is down 0.1% against the US dollar this morning, at $1.255, and a similar amount against the euro at ‚Ç¨1.1699. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says pessimism about the UK‚Äôs prospects are weighing on the poudns.  It seems clear that national resilience in the face of higher interest rates and painful borrowing costs has finally buckled. Even though the official recession recognition was expected, confirmation has pushed down the pound slightly, as pessimism about the UK‚Äôs prospects spreads.      9.41am GMT  UK direct debit failures jump  More bad news: the number of UK households missing their direct debit payments has jumped, as the cost of living squeeze tightens. New data from the ONS this morning shows that the total Direct Debit failure rate rose to 1.07% in January 2024. That is the highest level seen since the data series started in January 2019, and a 14% increase from January 2023.     9.32am GMT   There‚Äôs no reason to panic, yet, about the UK economy, argues Henry Cook, senior economist at Japanese financial services group MUFG. Cook points out that the jobless rate remains low, at 3.8% in the last quarter ‚Äì while consumer confidence has picked up:  All told, it was a disappointing set of GDP figures, but there‚Äôs no reason to panic just yet. For a start, the labour market remains firm with the unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, close to its historical low. Consumer confidence has also gradually improved over the last 18 months. That doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô to our minds. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs perfectly feasible that the ‚Äòtechnical recession‚Äô will be revised away in later national account updates. The overall picture remains one of a stagnant UK economy with the monthly GDP estimate for December 2023 at exactly the same level as it was 12 months previously. The economy has essentially drifted sideways as monetary policy tightening and squeezed household finances have weighed on activity.   Updated at 9.32am GMT    9.10am GMT  Full story: UK economy in recession as households cut spending  If you‚Äôre just tuning in.. we‚Äôve learned this morning that the UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed households cut back on spending in response to soaring interest rates and rising living costs. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and a collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output ‚Äì the technical definition of a recession. Official confirmation of a recession is a blow to the government with an election less than a year away and will embarrass Rishi Sunak, after the prime minister made growing the economy one of his five priorities for government at the start of last year.

Related: UK economy in recession as households cut spending       9.06am GMT   The UK‚Äôs fall into a technical recession is a blow for the Prime Minister on a day when he faces the prospect of losing two by-elections, says Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics. But there are also indicators that the recession is near its end, Gregory adds:  This is clearly a blow for the Prime Minister who has pledged to ‚Äúgrow the economy‚Äù in 2023 (whether he is referring to growth in 2023 as a whole (0.1% y/y) or in Q4 itself is not clear). But today‚Äôs release is more politically significant than it is economically. At the margin, it might nudge the Bank of England a little closer to cutting interest rates. But we doubt the Bank will be too worried about what is likely to be a mild and short recession. Overall, today‚Äôs release does not change much. We still think that the economy will contract by 0.1% q/q in Q1, but that a modest recovery will take hold in the second half of this year, as inflation falls, taxes are cut and the boost from lower interest rates starts to be felt.      9.02am GMT  Analysis: Even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak  The UK‚Äôs fall into a technical recession brings to an end a miserable year for the economy, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes:  Growth in 2023 as a whole was just 0.1% ‚Äì the weakest performance outside the Covid pandemic year of 2020 since 2009. In one sense, there is no comparison between 2009 and 2023. The former was a severe recession, with output declining by about 6% over a protracted period. In 2023 the economy had essentially stagnated: growing by 0.2% in the first quarter, remaining unchanged in the second quarter and then shrinking slightly in the second half of the year. That said, even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak, who made growing the economy one of his five new-year pledges at the start of 2023. As the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was quick to point out, the prime minister has failed to deliver on that promise.

The Chancellor told broadcasters:  ‚ÄúWe always expected growth to be weaker while we prioritised tackling inflation, that means higher interest rates, and that is the right thing to do because you can‚Äôt have long-term healthy growth with high inflation. ‚ÄúBut also for families when there is a cost-of-living crisis, when the cost of their weekly shop is going up, their energy bills are much higher, it is the right thing to do. ‚ÄúThe underlying picture here is an economy that is more resilient than most people predicted, inflation is coming down, real wages have been going up now for six months. ‚ÄúIf we stick to our guns, independent forecasters say that by the early summer we could start to see interest rates falling and that will be a very important relief for families with mortgages.‚Äù  The money markets expect the first rate cut to come by June.     8.26am GMT   City traders are now fully expecting three quarter-point cuts to UK interest rates this year, now the economy is in recession. Reuters reports that UK rate futures point to about 75 basis points of cuts to Bank Rate in 2024, compared with about 70 basis points before this morning‚Äôs GDP data was released. That means three cuts, lowering rates from 5.25% at present to 4.5% in December, are now fully priced in.  Updated at 8.26am GMT    8.20am GMT   Labour have accused Jeremy Hunt of being ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù, following his comments on the UK entering technical recession this morning, PA Media report. A spokesperson for the Labour Party said:  ‚ÄúJeremy Hunt‚Äôs comments are as insulting as they are out of touch. ‚ÄúThe Conservatives‚Äô failure to take any responsibility for Rishi‚Äôs recession show why we need an election.‚Äù  As covered earlier (7.33am) chancellor Hunt blamed high interest rates for slowing growth, and claimed the UK economy was ‚Äúturning a corner‚Äù.  Updated at 8.20am GMT    8.14am GMT  IPPR: UK needs investment not \"irresponsible tax cuts\"  The government must prioritise public investment rather than make ‚Äúirresponsible tax cuts‚Äù to held the economy, argues Pranesh Narayanan, research fellow at IPPR.  ‚ÄúThis time last year, the Prime Minister pledged to get the economy growing but today‚Äôs data, showing a mild technical recession, shows a stark lack of progress. ‚ÄúChronic underinvestment in hospitals, schools, net zero, and infrastructure has created a crumbling public realm and a broken economy. ‚ÄúThis should be a wake-up call that spurs the government to prioritise public investment rather than irresponsible tax cuts. Let‚Äôs fix our problems now rather than storing them up for later.‚Äù  There are reports this morning that Jeremy Hunt is considering slashing billions of pounds from public spending plans to fund pre-election tax cuts in next month‚Äôs budget. According to the Financial Times, the Treasury are considering reducing projected spending rises to about 0.75% a year, releasing ¬£5bn-¬£6bn for Budget tax cuts. The current plan is for real-term increases in public spending of 0.9%, which was already expected to cause ‚Äúimplausible austerity‚Äù ‚Äì and painful cuts to spending for departments whose budgets aren‚Äôt ringfenced.

GDP per head ‚Äì calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population ‚Äì shrank in each of the four quarters of last year. And it got worse through the year. GDP per head fell by 0.1% in January-March, then by 0.2% in April-June, before accelerating to a 0.4% fall in July-September and then a 0.6% drop in October-December. This shows that the downturn in living standards was deeper than the headline changes to output and activity in the economy. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, explains:  ‚ÄúBritain has fallen into recession, and a far deeper living standards downturn. Even this weak data is flattered by a rising population. After accounting for population growth, the UK economy hasn‚Äôt grown since early 2022, and fallen far behind its pre-cost of living crisis path, with an equivalent loss of around ¬£1,500 per person. ‚ÄúThe big picture is that Britain remains a stagnation nation, and that there are precious few signs of a recovery that will get the economy out of it.‚Äù   Seriously people - look at what's happening in terms of GDP/capita (which is what ultimately matters for our living standards).

After years of Tory stagnation, we are now in technical recession. ‚ÄúThe Conservatives‚Äô economic failures are hitting jobs and living standards. With household budgets at breaking point, spending is down and the economy is shrinking. At the same time our crumbling public services are starved of much-needed funding. ‚ÄúAfter being in power for 14 years, the Tories have driven our economy into a ditch and have no idea how to get out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for a government with a serious long-term plan and strategy for renewal, to revive our economy and sustain growth into future.‚Äù      7.42am GMT  Reeves: Rishi Sunak‚Äôs promise to grow the economy is now in tatters  This is Rishi Sunak‚Äôs recession, declares Rachel Reeves, Labour‚Äôs Shadow Chancellor. Reeves points out that the news that the UK is now in a technical recession will be ‚Äúdeeply worrying‚Äù for families and businesses. Following the news that GDP shrank by a worse-than-expected 0.3% in October-December, Reeves says:  ‚ÄúRishi Sunak‚Äôs promise to grow the economy is now in tatters. The prime minister can no longer credibly claim that his plan is working or that he has turned the corner on more than fourteen years of economic decline under the Conservatives that has left Britain worse off. This is Rishi Sunak‚Äôs recession and the news will be deeply worrying for families and business across Britain. It is time for a change. We need an election now to give the British people the chance to vote for a changed Labour Party that has a long-term plan for more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills. Only Labour has a plan to get Britain‚Äôs future back.‚Äù  As flagged earlier, today‚Äôs GDP report shows the UK stagnated in the second quarter of 2023, before shrinking in both Q3 and Q4.  Updated at 8.05am GMT    7.39am GMT   Britain‚Äôs slide into recession could put more pressure on the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates soon, to help the economy. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool‚Äôs management school, says the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter drop in GDP in Q4 2023 is ‚Äúabsolutely shocking ‚Äú, and also changes the ‚Äúmonetary picture‚Äù facing the BoE. Professor Milas tells me:  The drop in GDP is even worse than the 0.1% drop I predicted recently (details here) based on the ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù argument, that is, the very fact that divisia money [a measure of liquidity in the economy] has been shrinking consistently since 2023.  The Bank‚Äôs MPC (which predicted 0% growth in the February monetary policy report) cannot, and should not, ignore this shocking drop in GDP not least because it will carry over negative momentum in early 2024 and, at the same time, will accelerate the drop in inflation. The latest figure, and the fact that the economy is in (technical) recession will definitely bring into the picture a possible interest rate cut as early as March.      7.33am GMT  Hunt: There are signs the economy is turning a corner  The UK‚Äôs fall into recession is a blow to the government, coming just as the polls opened at two byelections in Wellingborough and Kingswood.   Related: Polls open for two byelections in testing times for Tories and Labour   It certainly doesn‚Äôt help the government to claim that their plan is working ‚Äì a familiar refrain in recent months. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is pinning the blame for the recession on high interest rates ‚Äì which the Bank of England has raised to a 16-year high of 5.25%. Hunt says:  ‚ÄúHigh inflation is the single biggest barrier to growth which is why halving it has been our top priority. While interest rates are high - so the Bank of England can bring inflation down - low growth is not a surprise. ‚ÄúBut there are signs the British economy is turning a corner; forecasters agree that growth will strengthen over the next few years, wages are rising faster than prices, mortgage rates are down and unemployment remains low. Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan ‚Äì cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.‚Äù   \"Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan ‚Äì cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.‚Äù Chancellor @Jeremy_Hunt on this morning's @ONS statistics. pic.twitter.com/yBc4UoR02Z‚Äî HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) February 15, 2024   Updated at 9.57am GMT    7.23am GMT  ONS: manufacturing, construction and wholesale were biggest drags on growth  Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, says manufacturing, construction and the wholesale industry were the biggest drags on growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.  McKeown explains:  ‚ÄúOur initial estimate shows the UK economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2023. While it has now shrunk for two consecutive quarters, across 2023 as a whole the economy has been broadly flat. ‚ÄúAll the main sectors fell on the quarter, with manufacturing, construction and wholesale being the biggest drags on growth, partially offset by increases in hotels and rentals of vehicles and machinery. ‚ÄúThe latest data showed that health and education performed less well than initially estimated in both October and November. Early indications suggest they both contracted in December. Retail and wholesale were the biggest overall downwards pulls on the economy in December, partially offset by growth in computer programming and manufacturing.‚Äù      7.19am GMT   The UK economy has now failed to grow for the last three quarters. GDP rose by 0.2% in January-March 2023 (which has been revised down from a previous estimate of 0.3%). It then stagnated in April-June, before shrinking by 0.1% in July-September ‚Äì and then this morning‚Äôs 0.3% slump in October-December.  Updated at 7.19am GMT    7.15am GMT   Net trade, household spending and government consumption all contracted in the final quarter of last year, helping to push the UK economy into a technical recession. Household expenditure fell by 0.1% in real terms (adjusted for inflation) in Q4 2023, following a downwardly revised fall of 0.9% in Q3, as consumers cut back in the cost of living squeeze. Export volumes fell by 2.9% in October-December, following a fall of 0.8% in July-September. The fall was driven by a 6.0% decline in services exports, which offset a 0.8% increase in goods exports. Real government consumption expenditure fell by 0.3%, due to lower activity in education and health.  The fall in health may reflect lower activity because of industrial action by NHS workers, the ONS suggests.     7.06am GMT  Marginal growth in 2023  While the economy has now decreased for two consecutive quarters, across 2023, GDP is estimated to have increased by 0.1% compared with 2022, the ONS says.     7.06am GMT   All three major parts of the UK economy contracted in October-December, today‚Äôs GDP report shows. The services sector, which makes up around three-quarters of the economy, declined by 0.2%. Production, which includes manufacturing, suffered a 1% drop in output, while construction shrank by 1.3%.     7.02am GMT  UK FALLS INTO TECHNICAL RECESSION  Newsflash: Britain has fallen into a technical recession. Around a year on from Rishi Sunak‚Äôs pledge to ‚Äúgrow the economy‚Äù, data just released by the Office for National Statistics shows that it contracted in the final three months of 2023.

Japan‚Äôs real GDP ‚Äì the total value of goods and services ‚Äì shrank by 0.1% in the last three months of 2023 compared to the previous quarter, due to weak spending by households and businesses, according to the cabinet office.

A poll by Bloomberg found that the median of economists expect GDP to slip 0.1%. in Q4 2023, with estimates ranging from a drop of 0.2% to a gain of 0.1%. Bloomberg explains:  ‚ÄúThe economy has been relatively resilient, but it‚Äôs lacking in significant momentum,‚Äù said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. ‚ÄúThis year is likely to be relatively uncertain because we have the elections coming up.‚Äù The BOE is forecasting a flat fourth quarter, which would leave the UK skirting a technical recession ‚Äî two consecutive periods of contraction ‚Äî by the narrowest possible margin.   Is the UK in a recession or just stagnating? GDP data due Thursday will decide, capping a pivotal week for markets and politics https://t.co/n0PXLPYmbS‚Äî Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 12, 2024      6.18am GMT  Introduction: GDP report to show if UK is in technical recession  Good morning. We‚Äôre about to learn how the UK economy fared in the final three months of last year, and whether it fell into a technical recession.The Office for National Statistics is due to report fourth-quarter GDP data at 7am this morning, as well as growth data for December alone. City economists predict they will show the economy shrank slightly in October-December, with GDP expected to have dropped by 0.1%. If so, that would be the second quarterly contraction in a row ‚Äì as GDP fell by 0.1% in July-September, meeting the ‚Äúrule-of-thumb‚Äù definition of a technical recession. GDP fell by 0.1% in July-September, so this would be a shallow recession, as these things go, certainly compared to the plunge in activity early in the Covid-19 pandemic. But even so, headlines declaring ‚ÄúBritain in recession‚Äù would surely be politically damaging, on a morning when voters in the constituencies of Wellingborough and Kingswood head to the polls in crunch by-elections.   Related: We‚Äôve given up the fight, say top Tories as byelection defeats loom   On the other hand ‚Äì if the UK avoids recession, even by a whisker, it could be a boost to the struggling Tories. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, says:  Having walked a fine line between stagnation and recession for some time, we think the UK economy will have likely slipped into a marginal technical recession in the second half of 2023 ‚Äì the first since the onset of the pandemic. Our models point to a 0.1% q-o-q contraction, driven in large part by falls in consumer spending and business investment.  As things stand, previous data has shown that monthly GDP fell by 0.3% in October, as all sectors of the economy contracted. But the economy then rallied in November, with 0.3% growth, driven by the services sector. Economists predict a 0.2% fall in GDP in December‚Ä¶.

        "content": "Hard-up students cutting back on midweek nights out have left town centres empty and bars and clubs struggling to stay afloat, the boss of the UK‚Äôs biggest nightclub chain has said. Peter Marks, the chief executive of Rekom, which owns the Pryzm and Atik chains, said high rents and all round increases in the cost of living mean many young people are either coming out later in the evening or not at all. He blamed the financial squeeze on students for the company‚Äôs decision to shut nearly half of its 35 venues and let go of 500 staff in cities and towns including Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Windsor and Wrexham last month. ‚ÄúThe cost of living is singularly the biggest issue that we face. A lot of students who used to be paying, say, ¬£800 a month for their accommodation, have been facing [higher rents of] ¬£1,200 a month,‚Äù he told the BBC. ‚ÄúObviously people still like coming out, [but] if money is tight [they] are coming later, so they‚Äôre arriving in our doors later and they‚Äôre spending less,‚Äù he added.   Related: UK inflation: which goods and services have changed most in price?   Marks said the student cost of living crisis had hollowed out weekday nightlife in cities such as Leeds, which he visited last month. ‚ÄúI walked around between 7pm and 11pm, and there were no more than 200 people out in the city. Two years before, it would have been really quite busy and buzzing.‚Äù But Rekom is not alone. Nearly 400 clubs have been forced to permanently shut their doors since the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, according to figures compiled by the Night Time Industries Association, which represents the sector. While some experts say students are generally drinking less for a variety of reasons including looking after their mental health, Marks suggested the evidence was not clear cut. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite interesting because there‚Äôs a lot of conflicting research on going out and drinking. So our view is ‚Äòlet‚Äôs just keep putting on a good night and people will come‚Äô. But if they have no money they can‚Äôt.‚Äù Marks said the situation was making it harder to cover rising business costs including staff wages and rent for venues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been facing some very high cost increases,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur wage percentage of turnover is as high as anything. For every ¬£100 we take, we are spending between ¬£30 and ¬£40 on wages. Whereas retailers are only paying ¬£12 in the ¬£100.‚Äù Cost pressures have also taken their toll on UK pubs. There were 509 closures in 2023 and a 6% decline in the past six years, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.

        "content": "The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis, in a heavy blow to Rishi Sunak‚Äôs promise to kickstart growth. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output ‚Äì the technical definition of a recession. Official confirmation of a recession will embarrass the prime minister before a general election expected this year, having made growing the economy one of his five flagship priorities for government. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Sunak‚Äôs promise was ‚Äúin tatters‚Äù after years of economic stagnation under the Conservatives. ‚ÄúThis is Rishi Sunak‚Äôs recession, and the news will be deeply worrying for families and business across Britain,‚Äù she said. The ONS said growth over the course of 2023 as a whole was estimated at 0.1%, the weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis, excluding the economic collapse in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. Highlighting a deep economic malaise as households come under pressure from soaraway prices and higher borrowing costs, official figures show economic growth per head of the population shrank for seven consecutive quarters, the worst performance since modern records began in 1955. The director of economic statistics at the ONS, Liz McKeown, said: ‚ÄúOur initial estimate shows the UK economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2023. While it has now shrunk for two consecutive quarters, across 2023 as a whole the economy has been broadly flat. ‚ÄúAll the main sectors fell on the quarter, with manufacturing, construction and wholesale being the biggest drags on growth, partially offset by increases in hotels and rentals of vehicles and machinery.‚Äù  Interactive  Economists had widely expected a shallow recession at the end of last year as households came under pressure from higher borrowing costs and rising prices for everyday essentials, forcing cuts elsewhere. Widespread strikes across the economy and heavy rainfall also dampened activity. More recent snapshots from the economy have, however, shown a rebound in consumer confidence since the start of this year, buoyed up by the prospect of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England as inflationary pressures cool.  Interactive  Andrew Bailey, the Bank‚Äôs governor, this week downplayed the significance of the quarterly GDP figures, suggesting there were signs of an upturn in the economy that would become clearer in the months ahead. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: ‚ÄúHigh inflation is the single biggest barrier to growth, which is why halving it has been our top priority. While interest rates are high ‚Äì so the Bank of England can bring inflation down ‚Äì low growth is not a surprise. ‚ÄúBut there are signs the British economy is turning a corner. Forecasters agree that growth will strengthen over the next few years, wages are rising faster than prices, mortgage rates are down and unemployment remains low. Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan ‚Äì cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.‚Äù The Bank is widely expected to begin cutting interest rates from as early as this summer amid growing concern over the strength of the economy after 14 consecutive increases in the cost of borrowing in response to soaring inflation. Official figures this week show inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged at 4% in January, having fallen back from more than 10% a year ago. Economic growth is forecast to outpace France and Germany this year, at 0.7%, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but significantly trailing the US and several other advanced economies. The ONS said since the UK economy was about 1% larger than its pre-pandemic level, ahead of Germany, but behind every other country in the G7 group of leading developed countries. The latest snapshot from the ONS indicated weakness across much of the economy at the end of last year, with a fall in GDP amid a tough Christmas shopping period for retailers. Reflecting on pressure on household spending amid the cost of living crisis, the ONS said output in the UK‚Äôs dominant services sector had fallen for three consecutive quarters, with a drop of 0.2% in the last three months of 2023. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: ‚ÄúThough the shallowness of this recession provides comfort, these figures also confirm that our economy remained locked in a cycle of persistent stagnation throughout 2023 as a myriad of headwinds, including high inflation, weighed heavily on activity.‚Äù"

        "content": "Annual profits at British Gas have soared more than tenfold after it tried to recoup costs from the energy crisis, while its parent company announced another ¬£144m payout to shareholders. Centrica released figures on Thursday showing that British Gas, which supplies energy to UK households and businesses, showed its profits jumped to ¬£751m in 2023, up from ¬£72m a year earlier. The big increase in earnings came after the regulator, Ofgem, raised the energy price cap and allowed the company to recoup some of the costs of having to sell energy below wholesale price to its 10 million customers during the energy crisis. Suppliers were forced to protect households from a spike in prices, which rose as a result of the Covid-19 lockdowns and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, causing dozens of companies to fail. The price cap rise, and subsequent increase in British Gas profits, pushed Centrica‚Äôs pre-tax profit to ¬£6.5bn for 2023, compared with a loss of ¬£240m a year earlier. The company‚Äôs preferred figure, which allows for bespoke adjustments, show profits fell 17% to ¬£2.8bn for the year to December. The chief executive, Chris O‚ÄôShea, said efforts to recoup costs supported British Gas profits only in the first half of the year, and the division took a ¬£200m hit in the final six months of 2023. He defended the remaining profits, which enabled Centrica to pay a final dividend worth ¬£144m to its shareholders. ‚ÄúI said this before and I want to take this opportunity to say it again: to be sustainable you must make a profit. Which is super important because every consumer in the UK is paying ¬£88 for the failure of other energy suppliers in the last few years. If more companies fail, these costs go on to customer bills.‚Äù The final dividend brings Centrica‚Äôs one-off payouts to investors to ¬£217m this year. Centrica said it was also voluntarily putting aside ¬£40m to support customers, on top of the ¬£100m spent in 2023. Centrica‚Äôs boss also renewed calls for a ‚Äúsocial tariff‚Äù that would allow poorer Britons to pay less for gas and electricity compared with those who are better-off, saying it was ‚Äúthe best thing we can do for consumers‚Äù. He did not clarify how he would like the initiative to be funded. O‚ÄôShea added that the company‚Äôs strong performance was unlikely to last but he was confident shareholders would continue to reap rewards. ‚ÄúAs you would expect, sharply lower commodity prices and reduced volatility will naturally lower earnings in comparison to 2023 as we return to a more normalised environment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur performance over the past year has reinforced our confidence in delivering against our medium-term sustainable profit ambitions and continuing to create value for shareholders.‚Äù The sharp increase in British Gas profits prompted a backlash from the union Unite, which is calling for the company to be nationalised. ‚ÄúCentrica is still raking in astonishingly high profits off the back of exorbitant energy bills that are nearly double what they were three years ago, Unite‚Äôs general secretary, Sharon Graham, said. ‚ÄúThere is no point beating around the bush: the only way to stop households and businesses being ripped off by the profiteers in our energy supply chain is public ownership. It is an absolutely affordable option that would protect the national interest. Our politicians need to decide whose side they are on and make the right choices.‚Äù"

        "content": "Ukraine has called for frozen Russian assets to be used to rebuild the country‚Äôs war-ravaged economy after a report showed the cost of reconstruction increasing to almost $500bn. In their third assessment of the likely price tag for recovery and reconstruction after Russia‚Äôs invasion two years ago, the World Bank, Ukraine‚Äôs government, the European Commission and the UN said the war had caused the economy to shrink by more than 25% and had been a ‚Äúdramatic setback‚Äù to Ukraine‚Äôs development. Ukraine‚Äôs prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said: ‚ÄúThe needs or reconstruction have continued to grow over the past year. The main resource for Ukraine‚Äôs recovery should be the confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the west. We need to start this process already this year.‚Äù An estimated $300bn of Russian assets have been frozen since the war started in February 2022. The report said the direct damage to Ukraine was $152bn but the 10-year cost of piecing together the country‚Äôs key infrastructure ‚Äì such as housing, roads, railways and power plants ‚Äì would be much higher at $486bn ‚Äì an increase of $75bn since its last report a year ago. In 2024 alone, Ukrainian authorities estimate the country will need about $15bn for immediate reconstruction and recovery priorities, of which only $5.5bn has been secured from international partners and its own resources. ‚ÄúThe last two years have seen unprecedented suffering and loss for Ukraine and its people,‚Äù said Antonella Bassani, the World Bank vice-president for Europe and Central Asia. ‚ÄúYet, while this updated assessment documents the extensive damages and consequent needs, it is at the same time a testament to Ukraine‚Äôs resilience ‚Äì demonstrating that the dedication and adaptability of its people have helped to already repair some of the damage and build towards recovery. The study, which covered the period until the end of 2023, said ‚Äúregular, intense‚Äù attacks on infrastructure had continued, with unpredictable air and drone bombardment extending beyond established and largely unshifting battle zones, and affecting cities such as Kyiv, Odesa and Lviv. ‚ÄúThe destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the hydropower plant in June 2023 has resulted in incalculable impacts to the environment and exacerbated challenges already faced by people struggling to access housing, water, food and health services, among others. ‚ÄúThere have also been serious attacks of ports, including in Odesa and Mykolaivska regions and alongside the Danube River, as well as cyber-attacks and intensification of drone and air attacks in the last months of 2023.‚Äù Direct damage had not escalated substantially since the second assessment covering the first year of the war, when it totalled US$135bn (‚Ç¨126bn) ‚Äì due to limited shifts in the frontline of war. Even so, the impact on Ukraine remained immense, with 10% of the housing stock either damaged or destroyed. As a result, millions of people had lost their homes and were seeking shelter from a shrinking pool of properties. There had been extensive damage to other sectors such as forestry, irrigation, water supply and sanitation, municipal services; emergency response and civil protection, commerce and industry, and culture and tourism. ‚ÄúAs of end-December 2023, recovery and reconstruction needs are estimated at US$486bn (‚Ç¨440bn), which is approximately 2.8 times the estimated nominal GDP of Ukraine for 2023‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúThese considerable needs arise from a war that has spanned a large geographical area (including urban areas) for an extended period of time.‚Äù Despite the continuing conflict, the report said Ukraine had managed to start recovery and restoration efforts, helped by financial support from donor countries and multilateral organisations. During 2023, restoration works were completed for 3,836 multifamily apartment buildings and 19,091 single-family houses; for 448 schools, 237 kindergartens, and 390 medical facilities and social protection institutions; and for 9,200 critical infrastructure facilities, 449 heating supply facilities, and 221 water supply and sanitation facilities."

        "content": "In the end it wasn‚Äôt really that close. The UK economy is now technically in recession after contracting by 0.3% in the final three months of 2023. The official data brings to an end a miserable year for the UK. Growth in 2023 as a whole was just 0.1% ‚Äì the weakest performance outside the Covid pandemic year of 2020 since 2009. In one sense, there is no comparison between 2009 and 2023. The former was a severe recession, with output declining by about 6% over a protracted period. In 2023 the economy had essentially stagnated: growing by 0.2% in the first quarter, remaining unchanged in the second quarter and then shrinking slightly in the second half of the year. That said, even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak, who made growing the economy one of his five new-year pledges at the start of 2023. As the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was quick to point out, the prime minister has failed to deliver on that promise. What‚Äôs more, the economy showed across-the-board weakness in the fourth quarter, with all three main sectors ‚Äì services, manufacturing and construction ‚Äì going backwards. There was also evidence that households had been cutting back on their spending as a result of cost of living pressures and the squeeze from higher interest rates. Consumer-facing services fell by 0.7% in the final three months of the year, largely as a result of people spending less in the shops and going out in the run-up to Christmas. Governments facing the prospect of a general election always want to generate a feelgood factor before polling day. Britain, in the last three months of 2023, had the opposite: a feel-bad factor.  Interactive  The picture would have been even worse had it not been for a rising population. Gross domestic product per head of population has not risen for seven straight quarters (six falls, one quarter unchanged) stretching back to early 2022. Jeremy Hunt put a brave face on what was clearly unwelcome news for a government facing two byelections on Thursday. The economy was ‚Äúturning a corner‚Äù, the chancellor said, and forecasters were predicting stronger growth over the coming years. Hunt may well be right. The worst for the economy is now probably over. Business and consumer confidence are picking up a bit. The housing market is showing signs of stabilising. The City is expecting the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates by the middle of the year. Ultimately, it makes little difference whether the economy is moving sideways or contracting marginally, particularly since revisions in the future may well show the UK was not in recession after all. But it would have certainly been politically helpful to Sunak and Hunt had the UK emulated the eurozone and narrowly avoided a recession in late 2023. The fact that it did not puts added pressure on the chancellor to come up with some ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù measures in the budget on 6 March."

        "content": "The London Overground is to be rebranded into six lines with names inspired by the capital‚Äôs and the country‚Äôs diverse modern history, from Windrush to the Lionesses. In autumn, the web of orange on the tube map will be replaced by six colours and routes to help make the capital‚Äôs public transport network easier to navigate. The six Overground lines will be called Lioness, Mildmay, Windrush, Weaver, Suffragette and Liberty. The names ‚Äì announced by Transport for London (TfL) and the city‚Äôs mayor, Sadiq Khan, after consultation with passengers, historians and communities ‚Äì celebrate historic moments in immigration and woman‚Äôs equality, honouring campaigners and workers. Khan said: ‚ÄúThis is a hugely exciting moment, transforming how we think about London‚Äôs transport network. Giving each of the Overground lines distinct colours and identities will make it simpler and easier for passengers to get around. ‚ÄúIn reimagining London‚Äôs tube map, we are also honouring and celebrating different parts of London‚Äôs unique local history and culture.‚Äù The Overground network was established from little-used or defunct rail lines between 2007 and 2015, and has grown rapidly to carry more than 3 million passengers a week. London‚Äôs transport commissioner, Andy Lord, said the Overground was very successful but was still shown as ‚Äúa complicated network of orange on route maps‚Äù, which was confusing for customers less familiar with the network. He said: ‚ÄúThese new names and line colours will simplify the maps and routes for our customers, and it is hoped it will encourage more people to make the most of our services. It is also a great way to tell the stories of some important parts of London‚Äôs cultural diversity.‚Äù The names and new map were unveiled by the mayor at an event in Highbury and Islington station, on what will be the Windrush and Mildmay lines, alongside figures including Fara Williams, England‚Äôs most capped footballer, and Arthur Torrington, a co-founder and director of the Windrush Foundation. Conservatives in London said Khan had wasted the opportunity to sell naming rights, with the party‚Äôs mayoral candidate, Susan Hall, accusing him of spending ¬£6.3m on ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù. The mayor rejected claims that he was spending funds unnecessarily, adding that he would like to ‚Äúscotch the rumour that he thought about naming one of the lines the Northern Leg of HS2, or even the Garden Bridge‚Äù. He said they had engaged with communities and experts to find names that would reflect the city‚Äôs heritage and be ‚Äúa source of huge pride‚Äù, as well as highlighting lesser-known aspects of London‚Äôs history, such as Mildmay‚Äôs part in the 1980s Aids crisis, and the role of working-class suffragettes in the East End. ‚ÄúThese stories are really important and hopefully people will find out more about [them],‚Äù the mayor said. Khan said the rebranding would have a practical benefit in way-finding and increasing usage and revenue. He said the investment, alongside freezing fares, would generate revenue by bringing ‚Äúmore commuters, meaning more fares coming in‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúFor the first time in TfL history, we‚Äôll be operating at a surplus without government support, which shows the sensible and prudent way we‚Äôve run it.‚Äù Strikes that were planned for next week on London Overground by RMT members have been called off after an improved pay offer, the union said on Thursday.  The new lines are: Lioness: Euston to Watford Junction. Runs through Wembley, honouring the England women‚Äôs football team; yellow parallel lines on the map. Mildmay: Stratford to Richmond/Clapham Junction. Runs through Dalston and honours the charitable hospital in Shoreditch‚Äôs pivotal role in the HIV/Aids crisis in the 1980s. Blue parallel lines on the map. Windrush: Highbury & Islington to Clapham Junction/New Cross/Crystal Palace/West Croydon. Runs through areas with strong ties to Caribbean communities, honouring the Windrush generation. Red parallel lines on the map. Weaver: Liverpool Street to Cheshunt/Enfield Town/Chingford. Travels through areas of London known for the textile trade, shaped by migrant communities. Maroon parallel lines on the map. Suffragette: Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside. Honours the fight for votes for women, running to Barking, home of the longest-surviving suffragist, Annie Huggett, who died at 103. Green parallel lines on the map. Liberty: Romford to Upminster. Referencing ‚Äúthe freedom that is a defining feature of London‚Äù, according to TfL, and the ‚Äúhistorical independence of the people of Havering‚Äù, where it runs. Grey parallel lines on the map."

        "content": "Australia‚Äôs economy is likely to slow until about the middle of 2024 until a combination of tax cuts, interest rate cuts and easing inflation begin to lift spending, according to Commonwealth Bank‚Äôs chief economist.\nThe CommBank Household Spending Insights index rose 3.1% in January, reversing most of December‚Äôs 3.5% slide, with the rebound led by a 13.5% rise in travel and recreation spending for the month, thanks in large part to record crowds at the Australian Open in Melbourne. Household goods spending was also up 10.5%.\n\n Related: Australia‚Äôs unemployment rate hits two-year high of 4.1% as higher interest rates bite \n\nBut January‚Äôs pickup may prove short-lived as the effects of the Reserve Bank‚Äôs interest rate rise would only be felt this month as variable lending rates get adjusted after a lag. ‚ÄúFebruary numbers will be critical,‚Äù CBA‚Äôs Stephen Halmarick said.\n‚ÄúWe think household spending and overall economic growth is going to continue to moderate for the first half of the year,‚Äù he said.\nAustralia‚Äôs gross domestic product likely expanded 1.5% in 2023 with household consumption up just 0.4%, the Reserve Bank said earlier this month. Annual GDP growth will slow further to 1.3% by June before reviving to 1.8% by the end of 2024.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nHow households respond to the rising cost of living, higher interest rates and taxes was one of the RBA‚Äôs key uncertainties in its rates setting. Should spending slow faster than expected, the central bank would be more inclined to cut interest rates.\n‚ÄúWith the annual rate of inflation in January expected to be approximately 3.5%, household spending is close to flat in real terms and remains weak on a real per capita basis,‚Äù Halmarick said.\nThe CommBank spending index, which tracks the purchases of more than 7 million CBA customers, registered modest increases in most of its 12 categories. Victoria‚Äôs reading was up 2.8% for the month alone, leading other states.\nBy the second half of 2024, households should start to get some relief, Halmarick said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe stage-three tax cuts ‚Äì which have been revised by the Albanese government to increase the benefits for those earning as much as $146,000 a year ‚Äì would kick in from 1 July, Halmarick said.\nCBA predicts the RBA will start to cut interest rates from September, lopping 75 basis points off the current 4.35% by the year‚Äôs end. Similar sized cuts should arrive by mid-2025.\nInflation, too, should be ‚Äúpretty close to 3%‚Äù by the end of 2024. Consumer prices were up 4.1% in the December quarter just past, compared with a year earlier.\n‚ÄúThe combination of those three things will improve household disposable income,‚Äù Halmarick said.\nThe CommBank index was up 3.6% last month compared with January 2023. The biggest increases were for insurance, up 11.3% from a year earlier, with spending on health up 7.8% and education 6.8%. Spending on transport was down 0.2%."

        "content": "Aurelius, the German restructuring specialist which bought The Body Shop last year and has now put it into administration, had previously broken up two other UK retailers. Staff at the ethical cosmetics group fear it will be next, with more than 2,200 jobs and 200 stores at risk. Aurelius, a specialist in distressed companies, has been active in the UK for some time. It bought the parent of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain in 2022, TV shopping business Ideal Shopping Direct in 2018 and the European and UK arm of retailer and office supplies business Office Depot in 2017, and went on to break up all three businesses.  But it has also held on to some of its acquisitions. It acquired trainer store Footasylum in 2022 and still owns it, and it also owns tile retailer CTD, which bought up 13 Tile Giant branches last year. Aurelius has yet to set out its plan for The Body Shop. But the group‚Äôs track record suggests administration may not necessarily mean oblivion. Based in Munich, it was set up by Austrian entrepreneur Dirk Markus and German Gert Purkert in 2005 with initial funding of ‚Ç¨500,000 (¬£425,000). Markus, a keen racing cyclist who currently lives in London, started his career as a management consultant at McKinsey and then co-founded Mercateo, an online business procurement platform, which was sold to energy firm E.On in 2000.  Purkert, a fellow McKinsey alumnus, co-founded equinet, a German advisory firm for small and medium-sized businesses. Aurelius has been operating in the UK for several years, but hit the headlines after it bought McKesson UK, the parent of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for ¬£477m in what the group called the ‚Äúbiggest deal in its history‚Äù. At the time, the chemist chain employed more than 2,500 pharmacists at almost 1,300 pharmacies. The pharmacy business was then gradually dismantled. In January last year Lloyds announced the closure of more than 200 outlets in Sainsbury‚Äôs supermarkets. That was followed by a year-long process of disposing of high street pharmacies to local independents. The group‚Äôs private travel clinic company MASTA was sold to Irish-led travel group Nomad Travel in May last year. The rump of the Lloyds retail business was put into liquidation in January this year, owing about ¬£30m to trade creditors and more than ¬£250m to other parts of the company. Aurelius still owns the parent company, now called Hallo Healthcare, which runs an online doctors‚Äô service and wholesale pharmacy distribution service for NHS hospitals and others. The pattern was not dissimilar to Aurelius‚Äôs tactics after buying the European arm of Office Depot, which had more than 100 stores and provided office supplies to over 100,000 businesses under the Viking brand. The business was gradually broken up in a series of transactions, with a large chunk of the wholesale arm sold to French Raja group, before the rump was put into liquidation with debts of more than ¬£1m in 2021. Ideal Shopping Direct was also broken up, with its Create & Craft channel and Freeview number and flagship Ideal World teleshopping businesses going to separate new owners. Insolvency experts say Aurelius could simply be slimming down The Body Shop in order to buy it back and run it more profitably. Whatever the plan, the first steps have been about conserving cash. The Body Shop at Home, a home selling arm which employed more than 100 people and had thousands of freelance sellers across Europe, has already been closed. The company has also refused to pay more than ¬£3m in long-term bonuses promised to current and former workers ‚Äì despite the fact that they were supposedly protected by being written into conditions of the sale by The Body Shop‚Äôs former owner Natura. Payment of the bonuses is now in the hands of administrators. Last month The Body Shop‚Äôs loss-making European business was separated off, with Aurelius telling staff and media it had been sold to an unnamed ‚Äúfamily office‚Äù. No further information has been disclosed. Filings in Europe suggest the buyer is a group named Alma24, which has close links to Aurelius via director and majority shareholder Friedrich Trautwein. He has been a director of companies linked to a number of Aurelius-owned groups including Autostore and book wholesaler Bertram group. He was appointed interim chief executive of Ideal Shopping Direct under Aurelius‚Äôs ownership. Aurelius said it was not a shareholder in Alma24. Putting the UK arm into administration can be used, say insolvency experts, as a way to cut costs at head office, warehouses and stores, with industry insiders expecting up to half of its 200 UK outlets to close.  Doing this via administration means redundancy payments and lease obligations are handled by administrators and are not a cost to Aurelius. Meanwhile, documents filed at Companies House show that on 30 January, Alma24 took out a charge, a form of financial guarantee, using as collateral a list of Body Shop properties including its Littlehampton head office and stores on Oxford Street and Manchester‚Äôs Trafford centre. This is understood to be linked to providing security over completion of the European deal. It is understood Aurelius is also a direct creditor of The Body Shop, which could make it difficult for rival interested parties to outbid the German firm when the UK shops come up for sale. The firm is understood to be the largest secure creditor, putting it in prime position to buy back a downsized Body Shop. A source close to Aurelius said it ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be against that option being put forward‚Äù and saw ‚Äúa lot of potential in a restructured business‚Äù. Andrew Pepper, a restructuring expert at ReSolve, said Aurelius was likely to be ‚Äúslimming down the shops to create a right-sized business fit for the future‚Äù with more focus on selling online. He said the UK business was likely to survive as it was vital to supporting the international network of franchise businesses. ‚ÄúWhat will they sell to the world if they don‚Äôt have the flagship business? They still believe in the Englishness of it. The real value is in its global presence.‚Äù"

        "content": "Australia‚Äôs jobless rate jumped to a two-year high in January as employers barely added any jobs and more people started to look for work. The economy added 11,100 full-time jobs and shed 10,600 part-time roles, leaving a net gain for the month of just 500 jobs. The jobless rate last month was 4.1%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That result compared with economists expecting the rate to tick up to 4% from December‚Äôs reported 3.9% with a net increase of 25,000 jobs.  Interactive  ‚ÄúThis was the first time in two years, since January 2022, that the unemployment rate had been above 4%,‚Äù said Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. Part of the increase in the jobless rate was because more people started to look for work at the start of the year although the participation rate remained unchanged from December at 66.8%. ‚ÄúOur labour market has been weakening but it has been weakening from a quite incredibly strong and resilient base,‚Äù the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told a media conference in Canberra. ‚Äú[W]e enter this period of economic uncertainty from a position of genuine strength and the labour market is a big part of that story.‚Äù Labour market figures have been volatile in recent months, with November jobs jumping 61,500 only for 65,200 to be lost in December, according to preliminary numbers. Economists estimate the economy needs to add about 30,000 jobs a month to keep the unemployment rate steady as the population swells. The Reserve Bank will be watching today‚Äôs employment figures as its assesses the impact of 13 increases of official interest rates since May 2022 that have lifted the cash rate to a 12-year high. RBA governor Michele Bullock told senate estimates earlier on Thursday:‚ÄúWe think we‚Äôre in a good position to get inflation down in a reasonable amount of time while still keeping employment growing,‚Äù she said. Hours worked in January fell by 49m, continuing a trend downwards since the middle of 2023. ‚ÄúSince October 2023, the annual growth rate in hours worked has slowed considerably, down to 0.7% in January 2024, and well below the annual employment growth of 2.6%,‚Äù Jarvis said.  The jobs story looks like more people working but hours worked falling. pic.twitter.com/xcZvfqAtL5‚Äî @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) February 15, 2024  Investors viewed the labour market figures as further reducing the chances of another RBA interest rate rise. The Australian dollar was down about 0.1 US cents to 64.9 US cents and the ASX 200 share index extended gains for the day by about 0.1 percentage points to 0.9%. Lower interest rates make it less attractive to hold the Aussie dollar while also making it cheaper for firms to borrow. Prior to today‚Äôs jobs figures, investors had fully priced in an RBA cut of 25 basis points in the cash rate to 4.1% by November, according to the ASX rates tracker. ‚ÄúThe swift weakening in labour market conditions raises some doubts as to whether we will see an orderly easing in conditions in 2024,‚Äù Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said. ‚Äú[P]olicy makers will be a little more concerned about the outlook after today‚Äôs data.‚Äù Sarah Tan, an economist with Moody‚Äôs Analytics, said ‚Äúcracks are emerging in the Aussie labour market‚Äù but forward indictors still pointed to ‚Äúrobust employment demand‚Äù. ‚ÄúDecember survey data from the Australian Department of Jobs and Skills showed 20% of respondents were looking to bring on more staff over the next three months,‚Äù Tan said. ‚ÄúSome 5% were looking to trim their workforces, compared with 3% in November.‚Äù Job vacancies also remained more than 70% above pre-pandemic levels with employers seeking about 400,000 workers. Population growth, though, was likely to exceed job generation, pushing the jobless rate to 4.5% by December, she said. New South Wales, the state that accounts for about a third of the economy, has dropped back to the pack with seasonally adjusted unemployment rate matching the national average at 4.1%. The state boasted a 3.4% jobless rate six months ago, compared with 3.7% for Australia overall. Victoria and the Northern Territory recorded the lowest unemployment rate at 3.9%, down from December‚Äôs rate of 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Tasmania, where voters go to the polls for a state election on 23 March, saw its jobless rate jump from 3.6% in December to 4.5% last month. Queensland, which is also going to the polls later this year, has seen its unemployment rate edge lower, from 4.5% in July to 4.2% last month. "

        "content": "Keir Starmer is being urged to more than double Labour‚Äôs investment in publicly owned renewable energy to save consumers billions of pounds on their bills, despite the party drastically scaling back its plans last week. In an intervention after the Labour leader scrapped the party‚Äôs ¬£28bn green investment pledge in the most controversial U-turn of his leadership, the Common Wealth thinktank said a step-change in government backing for clean energy generation was still required. It said plans to retain an initial cash injection in Great British Energy ‚Äì a state-owned renewable power generation company planned if Labour is elected to power ‚Äì was an important ‚Äúdown payment‚Äù, but should be increased to ¬£30bn over the course of a first term in office. There have been growing questions over Labour‚Äôs target to decarbonise the UK‚Äôs electricity system by 2030 after it slashed the funding package behind its green economy plans by half. As a key group influencing Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, Common Wealth was the first thinktank to promote a new publicly owned energy generator ‚Äì providing backing for GB Energy ‚Äì based on similar European firms such as Sweden‚Äôs Vattenfall, Denmark‚Äôs √òrsted and Norway‚Äôs Equinor. Miliband is understood to have pushed back against the dilution of Labour‚Äôs ¬£28bn investment plan, with speculation ‚Äì denied by his team ‚Äì that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming it would be scaled back. Labour has said GB Energy would be headquartered in Scotland as a ‚Äúhomegrown, publicly owned champion in clean energy generation‚Äù to enable the creation of jobs and manufacturing in Britain‚Äôs renewables sector. However, several details remain unclear, including whether it would operate green assets directly or control a portfolio of investments in other companies instead. Labour said last week that GB Energy would ‚Äúpartner with industry‚Äù and ‚Äúco-invest‚Äù in groundbreaking green technologies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and tidal stream energy. It has also suggested the party would help capital-intensive projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk with ‚Äúbacking and building‚Äù. The government is, however, seeking significantly more investment for the project than Labour currently plans for GB Energy, with ministers looking to raise ¬£20bn from outside investors after removing the Chinese state-owned group CGN in 2022 over security concerns. In a report setting out the case for a vast expansion of GB Energy in the early years of a Labour government, Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent ‚Äì helping to save households money on their bills. It said renewable investment financed out of Labour‚Äôs initial ¬£8.3bn capitalisation would save between ¬£125m and ¬£208m a year on debt interest costs each year ‚Äì saving up to ¬£1bn in total compared with private-sector borrowing, which is typically more expensive. Analysis in the report was based on estimates from the International Energy Association that a 2 percentage point increase in borrowing costs can lead to a 20% increase in a solar or wind project‚Äôs ‚Äúlevelised cost of electricity‚Äù, a measure of the average cost of each unit of electricity generated over the lifetime of an asset. Common Wealth said this was a good proxy for the savings between government-backed investment and the private sector, which could be passed on to households in the form of cheaper bills. Mathew Lawrence, Common Wealth‚Äôs director, said: ‚ÄúKeir Starmer‚Äôs renewed commitment to GB Energy, Labour‚Äôs proposed new public renewables company, is welcome. However, the true test of ambition is in its design and scale. ‚ÄúAn ambitious public renewables company like GB Energy on the scale of leading international equivalents would mean lower energy bills, good jobs in every part of the country, faster decarbonisation and energy independence for the UK - indeed it is the cornerstone of any serious attempt to transition our economy.‚Äù A Labour spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWith Labour‚Äôs ambitious ¬£8.3bn capitalisation of Great British Energy, we will invest in clean homegrown power that will cut energy bills, create the next generation of jobs in clean industries, and make Britain energy independent.‚Äù"

        "content": "Virgin Money bosses could be at risk of an embarrassing investor backlash, after an influential adviser hit out at a ¬£2.6m package for its chief executive, David Duffy, saying it was ‚Äúnot appropriate‚Äù compared with the bank‚Äôs average employee. Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), which advises shareholders including UK local authority pension funds, also raised concerns over what it said was ‚Äúa lack of board-level accountability for sustainability issues‚Äù at Britain‚Äôs sixth largest lender. Pirc is urging investors to vote against two resolutions at Virgin Money‚Äôs AGM on 1 March, when the lender will ask for backing for its annual report and pay report. The pay report explains how a dedicated committee of board members decided on the final payouts for bosses, based on their performance over the last financial year. The shareholder adviser said it was concerned over the level of Duffy‚Äôs package, which includes a ¬£331,000 bonus, and is 37 times higher than the average Virgin Money worker, who earns ¬£71,804 a year. ‚ÄúThe ratio of CEO pay compared to that of the average employee exceeds the recommended limit of 20:1 and is therefore not considered appropriate,‚Äù Pirc said. Median pay figures ‚Äì which calculate the mid-point of the range of salaries at the bank ‚Äì suggest an even larger gap. According to Virgin Money‚Äôs annual report, the chief executive‚Äôs total payout was 66 times that of the ¬£40,254 earned by the median employee. A shareholder rebellion would be a blow to the FTSE 250 bank, which just last year passed its pay policy with 98% approval. It would also be an embarrassment to Duffy, who has run the banking group since 2015, before Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group launched its ¬£1.7bn takeover of Virgin Money in 2018. The Pirc report comes after Virgin Money revealed a 42% drop in annual pre-tax profits in November, as it was forced to put aside ¬£309m to protect itself against potential defaults. The lender also announced last summer that it would shut 39 of its branches, accounting for nearly a third of its network, in a move that put 260 jobs at risk. It has left about 90 branches across the UK. Virgin Money defended its pay decisions, saying a statement that ‚Äúoffering competitive remuneration packages to senior leaders is essential to secure and retain talented individuals, with pay outcomes in line with the group‚Äôs remuneration policy, which was approved by c.98% of shareholders at the February 2023 AGM and benchmarked against industry‚Äù. The bank added that its board ‚Äúhas oversight of climate change risk and holds our business to account, with clear governance in place and strategic goals aligned to ESG [environmental, social and governance] objectives.  ‚ÄúWe are advocates of ESG transparency with robust targets, tracking and disclosures in our annual report and included on a dedicated sustainability hub on our website.‚Äù"

        "content": "The Bank of England governor has doused hopes that better-than-expected inflation news last month will accelerate cuts in interest rates, stressing the need for further evidence of wage moderation before Threadneedle Street moves. Appearing before the House of Lords economics committee on Wednesday, Andrew Bailey said it was ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù that inflation had remained unchanged at 4% in January but the previous month‚Äôs figure for the cost of living had been higher than predicted. Bailey said: ‚ÄúWe slightly overshot last month and we slightly undershot this month. That leaves us pretty much where we were.‚Äù Financial markets had been forecasting a rise in the annual inflation rate to 4.2% in January and now think the Bank will start cutting official borrowing costs from their current level of 5.25% in June. The governor said the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy committee ‚Äì the nine-member body that sets interest rates ‚Äì wanted to see more evidence of a cooling in wage rises before acting. It was likely pay bargainers would ask for smaller increases as inflation came down, he added. Bailey‚Äôs comments came as the Aslef rail union announced new strike dates and a six-month extension to its mandate for industrial action. After the worst year for industrial unrest since 1989, average public sector pay grew by 5.9% in the last quarter of 2023 compared with the year before, while private sector pay rose 5.8%. Investors put the chance of a quarter-point cut in June at 60%, up from 40% before the data was released. Threadneedle Street had predicted a small rise in inflation last month, while economists polled by Reuters expected an increase to 4.2%. Bailey said it was ‚Äútouch and go‚Äù the UK economy was in technical recession ‚Äì indicated by two successive quarters of falling output ‚Äì in the second half of 2023 but there were signs of a ‚Äúmodest pick-up‚Äù in activity in early 2024 that would continue thereafter. Hours earlier, the Office for National Statistics said inflation remained unchanged in January after the first fall in food prices in more than two years and deep discounts in the winter sales for clothing and furniture offset rising gas and electricity bills.  Interactive  Offering consumers some respite amid the cost of living crisis, the latest figures showed food and non-alcoholic drink prices fell at a monthly rate of 0.4% in January. It was the first monthly decline since May 2021, driven by price cuts on bread and cereals, cream crackers, sponge cake and chocolate biscuits. Against a backdrop of a tough Christmas for UK retailers because of weak consumer spending, furniture prices also fell at the fastest monthly rate in four years amid steep reductions for kitchens, leather settees, dining tables and chairs. Last month‚Äôs better-than-predicted news on the cost of living is likely to be followed by a fall in inflation to below the government‚Äôs 2% target within months, helped by a sharp fall in the Ofgem price cap in April amid a decline in wholesale energy prices. Inflation was last at 2% in July 2021 and rose to a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 before starting to decline. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: ‚ÄúInflation never falls in a perfect straight line, but the plan is working; we have made huge progress in bringing inflation down from 11%, and the Bank of England forecast that it will fall to around 2% in a matter of months.‚Äù Core inflation ‚Äì which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, and is closely watched by the Bank ‚Äì remained unchanged in January at 5.1%, according to the ONS. Services inflation rose to 6.5% in January, up from 6.4% a month earlier. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: ‚ÄúAfter 14 years of economic failure, working people are worse off. Prices are still rising in the shops, with the average household‚Äôs costs up ¬£110 a week compared to before the last election.‚Äù"

        "content": " London‚Äôs best known bagel shop, which claimed it never closed its doors, has been shuttered after its Brick Lane premises were apparently repossessed by its landlord. The Beigel Shop, an all-night eatery at 155 Brick Lane, known as ‚Äúthe yellow one‚Äù for its bright sign, and a magnet for generations of shoppers, clubbers and tourists, suddenly closed on Tuesday. A notice pasted inside appeared to be a repossession order. Its website, which was live as recently as last month and promoted the shop as a ‚Äúperfect spot for a light nosh, brunch, or midnight treat‚Äù, also appears to have been taken down. One of the owners of the building housing the store confirmed to the Guardian on Wednesday that he had instructed his solicitors to take back possession of the site. Efforts to contact the Beigel Shop were unsuccessful. It is not clear whether the business, which promoted itself as ‚ÄúBritain‚Äôs first and best‚Äù bagel bakery, will reopen. A message to customers on its Instagram account says it will be ‚Äúclosed for a short period to conduct essential electrical maintenance‚Äù and promises: ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be back before you know it‚Äù. The apparent repossession of the bakery and retail outlet, which was first reported by MailOnline, appears to have brought to a halt 169 years of bagel making on the site. Before it vanished from view, the brand‚Äôs website stated: ‚ÄúFounded in 1855, the Beigel Shop was the original and first beigel bakery to open on Brick Lane. Since then, this landmark institution has continued to provide the historic tastes and traditions of the Jewish East End, mixed with the flavours of an evolving multicultural community.‚Äù Open 24 hours a day, the current shop has existed in one form or another since two Israeli-born brothers took over what was then the Evering Bakery from the previous Israeli owners in 1987. Its old website said the store specialised in hot salt beef, salmon and cream cheese and chicken and salad bagels and boasted: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, we never close!‚Äù Despite the marketing claims, the shop has closed before. In 2014, the London daily, the Evening Standard, reported how it had reopened ‚Äúafter closing temporarily in a family dispute‚Äù. At the time, the paper added: ‚ÄúThe Beigel Shop owners and the building‚Äôs freeholders are understood to be negotiating a financial settlement but agreed it was in everyone‚Äôs best interests to reopen the business. ‚ÄúA ‚Äòwrit of possession‚Äô from the high court sheriff‚Äôs office had been posted on the shop door and dated 12 May, which stated that it was an offence to try and enter the premises‚Äù."

        "content": "  3.22pm GMT  Closing post: Bank of England governor says more evidence of slower wages needed  Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said that he wants to see more evidence of slowing wage growth before being confident that inflation will return to target, in evidence to parliament on Wednesday. Bailey said that the latest wage growth figures showed signs that pay rises were slowing, but not as far as the Bank expected, in testimony to the House of Lords economic affairs committee. US inflation surprised financial markets with a higher than expected reading on Tuesday. Today it was the turn of the UK, but the surprise came the other way. UK annual inflation remained at 4%, when economists were convinced that the consumer price index (CPI) would rise slightly because of higher energy bills. The slight downside surprise prompted a move down for sterling against the US dollar, and has helped the FTSE 100 to a 0.8% gain, outpacing the rest of Europe‚Äôs benchmark indices. However, Bailey told the committee that services inflation was not compatible with the Bank‚Äôs 2% target. The price of services rose to 6.5% in January from 6.4% in December. You can watch Bailey‚Äôs testimony live here. The key question is whether the Bank of England will see the milder inflation reading as support for cutting interest rates sooner rather than later. Financial markets are pricing in a 50/50 split between bank rate remaining at 5.25% by the Bank‚Äôs June monetary policy meeting and it falling to 5% ‚Äì a single cut. Market bets imply only a one-in-five chance of a rate cut in the previous meeting in May. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said:  It is a relief to see UK inflation coming in below expectations. The main downward driver came from heavy discounting of furniture and household goods, and a further slowdown in food inflation to the lowest level since April 2022 is very welcome news. If we see more easing in services inflation together with some weakness in economic data by then, the Bank of England would be more open to and comfortable with starting to cut rates in the second half of this year.  Pushpin Singh, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said:  The concern for policymakers will be that services inflation ticked up again in January, driven largely by elevated wage growth rates. Because of this, Cebr expects the Bank of England to remain cautious by not cutting rates before May and only doing so gradually thereafter.

Bookshops focusing one genre are not new (shout-out to detective specialist No Alibis in Belfast, Northern Ireland) but romance is being propelled by Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. At least eight other dedicated romance novel bookstores opened across the US in 2023, in cities from Wichita, Kansas, to Belfast, Maine, writes the Guardian‚Äôs Lois Beckett. At least three more have opened so far in 2024, in Florida and in Utah, with another planned in Portland, Oregon. As a genre, romance is defined by its focus on a central love story, and by its promise of a ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù for its main characters ‚Äì or at least, in more contemporary novels, a ‚Äúhappy for now‚Äù. Romance connoisseurs often refer to the amount of sex in the novels as a book‚Äôs ‚Äúspice level‚Äù, which from ranges from quite mild to very spicy indeed.

It has been helped by the milder inflation figures, which suggest that interest rates could drop sooner rather than later. Germany‚Äôs Dax is up by 0.35%, and France‚Äôs Cac 40 is up by 0.6%. The good mood on stock markets looks likely to pass through to Wall Street. Futures trading suggests that the benchmark S&P 500 index will gain 0.5% when it opens in 45 minutes, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is due for a 0.6% increase.     1.27pm GMT   The Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury has jumped 10% to a new record high after strong 2023 results. Bloomsbury has lifted its annual profit forecasts after the latest novel from the fantasy author Sarah J Maas topped bestseller lists across the globe, the Guardian‚Äôs Jack Simpson writes. The British publishing company told investors that its profits for the year would be ahead of December expectations, attributing much of this to the release of Maas‚Äôs latest book, House of Flame and Shadow. The novel, which was released on 30 January, is the third book in Maas‚Äôs series that follows Bryce Quinlan, a half human, half fairy-like creature, in the fantasy Crescent City. Maas‚Äôs ‚Äúromantasy‚Äù books have gained mass popularity around the world, and House of Flame and Shadow became the number one bestseller in the US, UK, Australia and a number of other countries. In the UK, it became the third-fastest-selling fantasy novel since records began, with 44,761 copies sold in its first week. The company said the new release had also driven demand for the previous 15 books written by Maas for Bloomsbury.

The company reached the operating profit landmark for 2023 after years of agggresive expansion across the world. That came with more than its fair share of controversy. But the company has changed its approach, and is now focusing on profitability. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, Uber‚Äôs chief financial officer, said:  Today‚Äôs authorization of our first-ever share repurchase programme is a vote of confidence in the company‚Äôs strong financial momentum. We will be thoughtful as it relates to the pace of our buyback, beginning with actions that partially offset stock-based compensation, and working towards a consistent reduction in share count.  (Let‚Äôs hope there aren‚Äôt any extra zeros in the press release like Uber‚Äôs rival, Lyft, earlier‚Ä¶)     12.12pm GMT   British weapons manufacturer BAE Systems has said it has got regulatory approval to take over American company Ball Aerospace. That opens the way for the completion of the $5.5bn (¬£4.4bn) cash and debt deal by the FTSE 100 company. Ball Aerospace‚Äôs parent company, Ball Corporation, traces its roots back to making paint cans and glass jars in the 1880s in Buffalo, New York, and it now makes beer cans and aerosol bottles by the million. But it was Ball‚Äôs space business that caught BAE Systems‚Äô eye. The aerospace business, up for sale since June, specialises in instruments, sensors and spacecraft, including some of the most sensitive satellite technologies, as well as civilian applications such as monitoring weather patterns. Ball‚Äôs optics technologies were used on the Hubble space telescope and it built the Kepler telescope used to search for Earth-like planets. Charles Woodburn, chief executive of BAE Systems, said:  In recent years, we‚Äôve said that we would seek out opportunities to grow our portfolio in advanced technology areas that meet our customers‚Äô most urgent needs, and completing the acquisition of Ball Aerospace is an example of that strategy in action.  The deal was first announced in August:   Related: BAE agrees to buy space technology firm Ball Aerospace for $5.6bn       11.57am GMT   Train drivers at five rail operating companies in Great Britain have voted to back a mandate that will allow them to continue striking for the next six months. Drivers from Chiltern Railways, c2c, East Midlands Railway and TransPennine Trains, all voted overwhelmingly in support of the mandate, which is a legal requirement for unions to continue industrial action. There are now live mandates at the remaining eleven train operating companies that Aslef, the drivers‚Äô union, is in dispute with. It comes two weeks after rolling strikes by Aslef across different regions caused widespread disruption for travellers across the country, with the majority of services cancelled.  Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said:  These results show ‚Äì yet again ‚Äì a clear rejection by train drivers of the ridiculous offer put to us in April last year by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of the train operating companies with whom we are in dispute. But we remain open and willing, as ever, to talk about a revised offer. That‚Äôs why we are asking the secretary of state for transport, or the rail minister Huw Merriman, to come and meet us. Mr Harper hasn‚Äôt seen fit to talk to us since December 2022; Mr Merriman has not been in the room with us since January 2023; and the RDG has not talked to us since April last year.      11.53am GMT  Virgin Media and O2 mobile customers hit with 8.8% bills increase  Millions of consumers with Virgin Media O2 are set to hit with the biggest increase in bills in the UK telecoms market this year, after the telecoms company revealed an inflation-busting 8.8% rise. Most of the main operators have mid-contract bill rises written into contracts that are linked to the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation for December, plus an added increase of 3.9 percentage points. Last month, BT, which also owns mobile operator EE, Vodafone and Three unveiled a 7.9% increase in customers‚Äô bills which will kick in from around April. Sky announced an increase of 6.7%. However, Virgin Media O2, which merged in 2021, follows the January rate of the higher retail price index (RPI) measure, plus an additional 3.9 percentage points. This means that a typical customer is facing an 8.8% increase in their bills from this Spring.  Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer watchdog Which?, said:  This month‚Äôs RPI announcement will confirm the worst fears of O2 and Virgin Media customers who now face the biggest broadband and mobile price hikes by any major provider this April. This comes on top of a more than 17% increase last year. That‚Äôs a huge overall increase that most people would not have anticipated when they first took out their broadband or phone deal.‚Äù  Last year, it was only O2 customers who faced a steeper rise, but now Virgin Media has joined its merger partner in following the higher RPI measure of bill increases. Virgin Media O2 points out that for mobile customers the rise does not affect their entire bill, which includes payments to own a mobile phone, and will only apply to the cost of their airtime contracts, or what customers pay for calls, texts and data. The company said that this makes the effective price increase for mobile customers 5% this year, while for Virgin Media customers the rise will equate to an average ¬£4.16 per month, ‚Äúaround the cost of a takeaway coffee‚Äù. A spokesman for Virgin Media O2 said:  We are investing heavily to ensure we continue to provide the fast and reliable connectivity our customers rely on, and the amount we receive from price increases is greatly outweighed by the ¬£5m we invest every single day to upgrade our networks and services to give customers a better overall experience. It‚Äôs clear that we continue to offer excellent value, with customers paying less and receiving more.‚Äù  In December, Ofcom proposed banning index-linked rises, saying they were too confusing for consumers. Last month, BT become the first big telecoms company to scrap the inflation-linked price rises for mobile and broadband customers, although not before pushing through a final increase this year.     11.31am GMT   The official housing data from the Office for National Statistics is behind measures from lenders Nationwide and Halifax. So we have a good sense that the broader ONS measure is likely to recover in the coming months. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average UK house price increased by 0.3% in December 2023, following a month-on-month decrease of 0.7% in November 2023.  Nevertheless, some economists believe prices may have a bit further to decline. They are down by 2.4% below the September 2022 record. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said  We continue to expect a 5% peak-to-trough fall, though the risks appear to be skewed towards a smaller decline. Further ahead, we expect the official measure to follow the Nationwide measure and start to rebound, as the fall in mortgage rates and recovery in real incomes boosts affordability.  Barret Kupelian, chief economist at PwC UK, an accountancy firm, said:  House prices grew marginally on a seasonally adjusted basis in the last month of 2023 and private rental inflation has stabilised. This could be the first in a series of steps leading up to a return to some semblance of normality in the residential property market.  In the short term, leading indicators suggest that downward pressure on house prices continue to ease, with London leading the trend [‚Ä¶] With supply of housing subdued and demand returning, house prices growth is therefore likely to pick up pace in the next few months.      11.14am GMT  UK house prices drop 1.4% in year to December  For house buyers, rather than renters, prices fell ‚Äì but at a slower rate than before. UK house prices fell by 1.4% in the year to December, according to the Office for National Statistics. That was a slower decline than the 2.3% in the year to November. The average UK house price was ¬£285,000 in December 2023, which was ¬£4,000 lower than 12 months previous.      10.55am GMT   UK rental prices rose by 6.2% in the year to January, remaining at the fastest rate of growth since the measure was introduced in 2016. The Office for National Statistics said:  Annual private rental prices increased by 6.1% in England, 7.0% in Wales and 6.8% in Scotland in the 12 months to January 2024.  Within England, London had the highest annual percentage change in private rental prices in the 12 months to January 2024, at 6.9%, while the North East saw the lowest, at 4.7%.      10.43am GMT   The biggest surprise in today‚Äôs European data is not on GDP: it is the 2.6% jump in industrial production across the eurozone. It was Ireland that drove that increase ‚Äì industrial production was up by 44%. But when it comes to Irish economic data, sometimes a bit of caution is required. Ireland‚Äôs economy has a lot of foreign money flowing through it without leaving much of a mark in the real world. This is a slightly different issue, but a similar one. Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING Bank, said that he reckons the truer figure is probably about 0.3%:  Eurozone industrial production experienced an Ireland driven jump in December, this should be interpreted with caution given Irish volatility thanks to the big share of contract manufacturing and outsourcing in Irish production. pic.twitter.com/R3d2T5IMDK‚Äî Bert Colijn (@BertColijn) February 14, 2024   Excluding Ireland we estimate that production grew by 0.3% in the eurozone, still defying continued German weakness where production declined by -1.2% in December. But while that is an encouraging note at the end of 2023, the overall trend for the eurozone excl Ireland was down. pic.twitter.com/NvwwIp4SsC‚Äî Bert Colijn (@BertColijn) February 14, 2024  Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, a trading platform, said:  With industrial production enjoying a 2.6% jump in December (best since mid-2022), we are seeing some signs that the region is starting to pick up after what has been a particularly tough few years for manufacturers.      10.20am GMT   Germany‚Äôs economy ‚Äì the largest in Europe ‚Äì contracted by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2023. But the overall bloc was held up by Spain, whose economy grew by 0.6% in the quarter. Its neighbouring economy, Portugal, rose by 0.8%. But there was good news in the employment figures. Euro area employment rose by 1.3% year-on-year in the final quarter. That was above the 1.1% expected by economists.     10.09am GMT  Eurozone GDP unchanged at 0%, meaning bloc avoided recession  The latest eurozone GDP figures have confirmed that the bloc narrowly avoided a recession in the final three months of 2023 ‚Äì while employment increased more than expected and industry surprised economists with strong growth in output. Statistics office Eurostat confirmed that GDP grew 0% in the final quarter of 2023, in line with the preliminary reading. Output had declined by 0.1% in the previous quarter ‚Äì and that reading was also confirmed. Two quarters of consecutive declines in output are usually counted as a technical recession. In this case the bloc has avoided that fate ‚Äì although its economy is still struggling.     10.00am GMT   Here‚Äôs a story from last night to make you pause before you next press ‚Äúsend‚Äù (or, indeed, publish a blog post)‚Ä¶ US taxi-hailing app Lyft shares surged ‚Äì then just as rapidly slumped ‚Äì after a typo in a press release said that its margins were going to expand by ‚Äú500 basis points‚Äù (or five percentage points). That was when they realised their error: it should have read ‚Äú50 basis points‚Äù. The Uber rival‚Äôs shares soared by more than 60% in after-hours trading, only to fall back once the company corrected the fat finger figure. But investors were still fairly happy: the share are still up by 17% in pre-market trading, ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs opening bell on Wall Street. Rides to stadiums grew more than 35% last year from 2022, mainly driven by Taylor Swift‚Äôs Eras tour, Beyonc√©‚Äôs Renaissance world tour and sporting events, Lyft said.   Related: Lyft stock soars thanks to Taylor Swift, Beyonc√© and layoffs       9.50am GMT  Sony cuts forecasts for PlayStation 5 sales  Sony has cut its forecasts for sales of the PlayStation 5 in the year to the end of March, Reuters reports. The Japanese company said it will sell 21m of the consoles, down from 25m previously, after sales during the end-of-year holiday season disappointed despite big spending on promotions to attract buyers. The company will also list its financial business in October 2025 as the conglomerate focuses on the businesses where it is strongest: entertainment and image sensors. Bloomberg News reports that Naomi Matsuoka, Sony‚Äôs senior vice president, said:  Looking ahead, PS5 will enter the latter stage of its life cycle. As such, we will put more emphasis on the balance between profitability and sales. For this reason, we expect the annual sales pace of PS5 hardware will start falling from the next fiscal year.  Bloomberg also has this interesting nugget on Sony‚Äôs development of games:  The disappointing hardware sales came despite a strong quarter for software. Released in October as a PS5 exclusive, Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man 2 sold 2.5m copies in its first 24 hours, making it the fastest-selling debut from Sony‚Äôs in-house studios.      9.37am GMT   Across Europe stock markets are all up today (after some dipped at the open) although the FTSE 100 is the leader. Germany‚Äôs Dax is up by 0.1%, while France‚Äôs Cac 40 has gained 0.3%. One of the most prominent movers is Heineken, which is down 4.8% after warning that profits could fall below estimates. The Dutch beer maker blamed geopolitical and economic volatility. Heineken chief executive Dolf van den Brink said:  We remain cautious about the global economic and geopolitical outlook.  Reuters reports:  Beer brewers raised prices significantly throughout 2023 to offset steep increases in costs, hurting volumes. Heineken‚Äôs volumes fell by 4.7% organically in 2023, with more than 60% of that driven by declines in Vietnam and Nigeria, where economic and political conditions hurt sales.      9.27am GMT  European Central Bank needs more time before cutting interest rates  While the Bank of England may be on track for rate cuts in the next few months, across the Channel (well, ok, in Frankfurt) the European Central Bank still needs more time. That‚Äôs according to Luis de Guindos, the ECB‚Äôs vice-president (and number two to the boss, president Christine Lagarde). In a speech this morning in Split, Croatia, he said it was too early to cut interest rates for the euro area. The ECB will keep rates ‚Äúat sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary‚Äù. He said:  While inflation is on the right track, we need to keep a close eye on the risk factors at play. On the upside, wage pressures remain high and we do not yet have sufficient data to confirm they are starting to ease. Profit margins could also prove more resilient than anticipated. Heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, could raise energy prices and disrupt global trade. While we are heading in the right direction, we must not get ahead of ourselves. It will take some more time before we have the necessary information to confirm that inflation is sustainably returning to our two per cent target.   Updated at 9.27am GMT    9.16am GMT   Inflation remains a problem for every household, despite recent falls that have more than halved the consumer prices index since a peak in 2022. The latest figures for January show gas and electricity bills were pushed higher by Great Britain‚Äôs regulator, Ofgem, lifting the prices cap by 5%, while restaurants and hotel charges jumped 7% year on year. Worse is the price of electricity, gas, and other fuels. Inflation for this category has fallen by 18% since its peak in January 2023. However, prices last month were 89% higher than they were in January 2021. These are dramatic increases in the cost of living. So it is no wonder the boss of the TUC, Paul Nowak, is hopping mad about any talk of lower inflation somehow meaning the problem has gone away for most people. You can read the full analysis here:   Related: UK households face battle to regain former living standards even if inflation eases       9.13am GMT   The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) expects inflation to fall further during 2024 ‚Äì but it added that there is a hint of some inflationary pressure out there. In particular, Paula Bejarano Carbo, a Niesr economist, highlighted inflation in the price of services rising to 6.5% from 6.4% in December. (The Bank of England keeps a close eye on services inflation because it is a handy insight into the UK specifically, rather than international factors.)  Given our forecast that #inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the first half of 2024 due to base effects, today‚Äôs downward surprise may signal that inflation is set to fall even faster than we projected. However, this is unclear given today‚Äôs core inflation‚Ä¶‚Äî National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) February 14, 2024      8.57am GMT   Nobody appears to be dissenting that UK inflation and interest rates are both headed downwards in the coming months. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, an investment bank, has not seen anything from the latest data to go against that:  UK CPI inflation level at 4.0% YoY in January. Unchanged on Dec. Always the hardest month to draw insight from given basket rotation/retailer discounting. Message is that inflation is down by almost 2/3rds from peak - & will come down further over the next couple of quarters.‚Äî Simon French (@shjfrench) February 14, 2024  Indeed, the ‚Äúsoftening‚Äù of core inflation is the most important number from January‚Äôs inflation figures, he argues.  Most important data point from first glance of UK inflation data - seasonally adjusted core CPI softer in January (+0.1% MoM) after an upside blip in December.

Persimmon is the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 3%, while Taylor Wimpey has gained 1.9%.     8.31am GMT   Let‚Äôs take a look at what financial markets are saying on the prospects for UK interest rates. The below table shows the likelihood of interest rate moves at each meeting of the Bank of England‚Äôs monetary policy committee ‚Äì according to the bets of financial traders. It shows that in May traders think there is a one-in-four chance of a rate cut. However, in June that rises to a 55.7% chance of a rate cut. And by December markets are pricing in almost three rate cuts. If the Bank goes through with three cuts that would leave interest rates at 4.5% by the end of the year, down from 5.25% now.     8.16am GMT  Mild UK inflation supports interest rate cuts in May, say economists  UK inflation has remained unchanged at 4%, surprising economists who had predicted a small increase to 4.2%. The figures showed the first monthly fall in food prices for more than two years. Food and non-alcoholic drink prices fell at a monthly rate of 0.4% in January, the first monthly decline since May 2021, driven by price cuts in January for bread and cereals, cream crackers, sponge cake and chocolate biscuits. Furniture and household goods prices also fell. That offset the rise in gas and electricity costs after the Great British energy regulator raised its price cap.  You can read our full report here:   Related: UK inflation remains unchanged at 4% as food prices fall   The lower-than-expected figure gives some relief to the Bank of England, which is expected to start a cycle of interest rate cuts in the coming months. It suggests that inflation is on a downward trajectory. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said: Looking ahead, it remains likely that the headline rate of CPI inflation will fall back to about 2.0% in April and then modestly undershoot the 2% target over the following six months. He cites some key factors ahead for the UK. Great Britain‚Äôs energy regulator Ofgem is expected to cut the energy price cap by about 15% in April. The government will probably freeze fuel duty, as it has done for a decade. And food price inflation is expected to remain low as well. Tombs expects this to persuade the Bank of England‚Äôs rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) that interest rates can fall in the coming months:  We continue to think that CPI outturns over the coming months will convince the MPC in the second quarter that monetary policy does not need to be quite as ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù as it is currently, though it looks like a toss-up whether the committee will opt to cut bank rate for the first time in May or June.   Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, an economic forecaster, said:  The EY Item Club continues to think that CPI inflation should fall to, and perhaps even below, the Bank of England‚Äôs 2% target over the next few months. Lower wholesale gas prices mean energy bills are on course to fall by around 15% in April when the Ofgem cap, which governs the typical household energy bill, is recalculated. And if the most recent decline in gas prices (which are now well below levels just prior to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine) is maintained, another double-digit percentage fall in bills could be on the cards for July. Disruption to shipping due to geopolitical tensions presents a potential risk to inflation‚Äôs descent. But with shipping costs only a tiny part of the price consumers pay for goods, that inflationary risk looks modest at present. Overall, the latest inflation data should reassure the MPC that the time to start cutting interest rates is approaching. The EY Item Club continues to expect the first cut in bank rate in May.      8.05am GMT   The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.5%, possibly helped by a weaker pound after the inflation data. London‚Äôs blue-chip index has also been helped by strong figures from Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, a distributor of the soft drink which is up 5% in the opening trades. Across Europe it has been a less rousing start to the trading day. Here are the opening snap reports on stock markets, via Reuters:  EUROPE‚ÄôS STOXX 600 FLAT FRANCE‚ÄôS CAC 40 DOWN 0.2%, SPAIN‚ÄôS IBEX UP 0.2% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 0.1% EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 0.2% GERMANY‚ÄôS DA FLAT   Updated at 8.10am GMT    7.44am GMT   The weaker pound appears to be helping prospects for the FTSE 100 companies, which make the bulk of their earnings in other currencies. FTSE 100 futures suggest the index will gain 0.5% when they open in about 15 minutes‚Äô time.     7.42am GMT   The Bank of England is gearing up to cut interest rates. That would generally be expected to push up inflation, so Bank governor Andrew Bailey would be in a tricky position if headline inflation were rising. As it is, financial markets are looking more comfortable with the idea that several cuts in the main lending rate, bank rate, are on the way. UK interest rate futures show that markets have increased their bets on rate cuts during 2024. They imply that rates will fall by 0.71 percentage points during 2024, up from 0.58% before the data, according to Reuters. Bank rate is at 5.25%, so that would suggest nearly three interest rate cuts during 2024 (assuming each cut is 0.25 percentage points).  This is a relief to the government and Bank of EnglandCore inflation was lower than thought, services inflation edged up less than expected, and monthly price growth was -0.6%,  double the forecast drop¬£ at a 1-week low - traders were braced for a nasty shock after US CPI‚Äî Lizzy Burden (@lizzzburden) February 14, 2024      7.32am GMT   Jeremy Hunt may not be the only person feeling somewhat relieved this morning: for the Bank of England it will likely forestall criticisms of its monetary policy stance. The reaction on financial markets suggests that may be the case: sterling has dipped by 0.14% against the US dollar and 0.2% against the euro. That move usually suggests a bet on lower rates (which are less attractive for investors able to move their money all over the world in search of better returns). Here is the graph showing the move in sterling as the lower-than-expected inflation reading came in:     7.24am GMT   The political reaction to the inflation reading has started. Here is what chancellor Jeremy Hunt had to say:  Inflation never falls in a perfect straight line, but the plan is working; we have made huge progress in bringing inflation down from 11%, and the Bank of England forecast that it will fall to around 2% in a matter of months.  Rachel Reeves, Labour‚Äôs shadow chancellor, said:  After 14 years of economic failure working people are worse off. Prices are still rising in the shops, with the average households‚Äô costs up ¬£110 a week compared to before the last election. Inflation is still higher than the Bank of England‚Äôs target and millions of families are struggling with the cost of living.  The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken. It‚Äôs time for change. Only Labour has a long-term plan to get Britain‚Äôs future back by delivering more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills.      7.20am GMT   We usually quote inflation as an annual number, but the monthly reading also suggests the downward trajectory: on a monthly basis, the consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.6% in January. The core measure of CPI also remained unchanged in January, at 5.1% annually. And that was lower than the 5.2% expected by economists. The core measure ignores volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco to try to get a more accurate picture of underlying inflationary pressures.     7.13am GMT   The headline inflation reading supports the interpretation (see opening post) that price pressures are easing in the UK. Here is the ONS‚Äôs graph showing that trajectory, starting in 2014. Inflation spiked in 2022 after Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion rocked global energy markets, before falling back as those increases faded.     7.07am GMT   Rising energy prices ‚Äì after Great Britain‚Äôs energy regulator raised the price cap ‚Äì were the main reason that inflation stayed at 4%, according to the UK‚Äôs Office for National Statistics (ONS). But it was furniture and household goods that prevented the expected increase. It said:  The largest upward contribution to the monthly change in both CPIH and CPI annual rates came from housing and household services (principally higher gas and electricity charges), while the largest downward contribution came from furniture and household goods, and food and non-alcoholic beverages.   Updated at 7.24am GMT    7.01am GMT  UK inflation stays flat at 4% in January  Newsflash: The UK‚Äôs consumer price index (CPI) inflation has stayed flat at 4% in January ‚Äì unchanged from December. Economists had expected a small increase to 4.2%, so this is a softer reading than expected.     6.51am GMT  UK inflation expected to rise, say economists  Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. UK inflation has fallen sharply in the last year as the global energy market has calmed down following the chaos caused by Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But inflation may well have ticked upwards in January: we will find out whether that was indeed the case at 7am UK time. Economists are forecasting a small increase in the UK‚Äôs consumer price index (CPI) in January. A poll by Reuters of economists suggests that inflation will rise from 4% in December to 4.2%. That would be a second consecutive monthly increase, although still well down from its 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022. The below chart shows the data for the last five years up to December. Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, said:  After headline inflation surprised to the upside in December, we expect a further ‚Äì albeit marginal ‚Äì jump in inflationary pressure.  However, Raja warns against getting too excited if inflation does rise as expected. The rate will be ‚Äúlifted in large part by positive base effects‚Äù, meaning that the index was temporarily lower last year than would otherwise be expected. That has partly been caused by increases in January to the government‚Äôs energy price cap And factory prices tracked by the producer prices index (PPI) are also softening, which should eventually be passed through to slowing inflation for consumers. Raja said:  Looking ahead, we continue to see disinflationary pressures build, consistent with slowing survey and PPI data. We see CPI slowing below 2% year-on-year in [the second quarter of 2024], before edging a little above 2% through [the second half of 2024].  Looking ahead, we also have the second estimate for eurozone GDP. The first reading showed 0% growth. That‚Äôs hardly something to write home about, but it took economists by surprise, and meant that the bloc avoided a technical recession. We will be on the lookout for any downward revisions for the fourth quarter, which would mean that the eurozone was, in fact, in a technical recession. Downward revision or not, it would hardly change the situation: Europe‚Äôs economy is stuttering as Germany struggles.

        "content": "Australian policy is dominated by interest groups and politicians pretending they are trying to do one thing, while actually doing the opposite, and by those same groups pretending that the policies in place are working while they actually fail. This is most obvious when we talk about negative gearing and housing.\nWhenever discussing any policy, we always should step back and ask what we are trying to do, and whether what we have been doing has worked.\nTake, for example, industrial relations. Have IR policies over the past 25 years improved productivity? After all, we hear it said all the time that this is the aim.\n\n Related: Sydney risks becoming ‚Äòcity with no grandchildren‚Äô as housing costs push out families, expert warns \n\nAnd yet, since the creation of the Productivity Commission 26 years ago, we have had a mass of things business groups dreamed about and told us would improve productivity ‚Äì ever more flexibility, lower income tax, lower wage growth, less industrial action and much less union power. And guess what ‚Äì productivity growth has been falling:\n \n\nIf this graph does not display, click here\nBut when the government passed the ‚Äúclose the loopholes‚Äù bill and included the right to disconnect, we have heard no end of voices from business groups, their media mouthpieces and Peter Dutton telling us that this will kill productivity.\nHave they been telling us fibs for the past decades about what improves productivity? Or are they just ignorant about what productivity actually is? Have they failed?\nThe answer might seem to be yes, but if you instead ask if IR policy over the past 25 years has actually been designed to keep wages down and increase company profits, you get a different result. By that measure it has been spectacularly successful.\nThe same applies to housing policy.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nWe are told that the housing tax policy of negative gearing interacting with the capital gains discount will generate new housing investment and thus improve housing affordability.\nIn reality, it‚Äôs just a tax minimisation policy disguised as housing policy.\nWhile negative gearing gets all the hate, it really was John Howard who destroyed our housing market by handing out a big tax-free gift to property investors.\nPrior to June 2000, if you made a capital gain (ie a profit from an investment) you discounted the profits by the level of inflation over the period of the investment before paying tax.\nThen Howard (and Costello) changed it to being a straight 50% discount.\nIf you bought a property for $500,000 and 10 years later you‚Äôre able to sell it for $1m at a profit of $500,000, rather than pay tax on the whole $500,000, you only pay tax on $250,000. The other $250,000 is yours, tax free.\nThat is about as sweet as it gets.\nThis change made speculating (sorry, ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù) in housing very lucrative.\nAnd it was a gamechanger for negative gearing, which had been around forever but which was not all that worthwhile.\nNow you could buy a property, rent it at a loss, use that loss to reduce your taxable income (negative gearing) and when the value of the property had risen enough, you could sell it and only pay tax on half the profit.\nThat‚Äôs minimising your tax both coming and going.\nIt massively increased the amount of capital gains being earned and the amount of negative gearing:\n \n\nIf this graph does not display, click here\nIf that were all we were worried about, the issue would just be about fairness, because the benefits of both capital gains discounts and negative gearing deductions overwhelming flow to the richest:\n \n\nThe richest 10% get 82% of the total benefits of the capital gains discount. Treasury estimates that in 2023-24 that would be about $15.6bn of $19.05bn.\n\n Related: Guardian Essential poll: any changes to negative gearing get lukewarm support \n\nRemember that the entire cost of the new stage-three tax cuts is around $23bn.\nNegative gearing is slightly less skewed to the rich but the top 20% still get just over half of the estimated $27.1bn in benefits for this financial year.\nPeople earning over $250,000 make up 2% of all individuals in the tax system but they account for 11% of the amount of rental losses (ie negative gearing) and 62% of capital gains:\n \n\nIf this graph does not display, click here\nAnd the more people earn, the larger their capital gain or rental loss:\n \n\nIf this graph does not display, click here\nBut bad as this is, it avoids the real issue.\nLet‚Äôs go back to the start ‚Äì have the 24 years of capital gains tax discount and negative gearing led to better housing affordability?\n \n\nIf this graph does not display, click here\nClearly not.\nFrom June 1989 to June 2000, the average annual growth of both average household disposable income and average dwelling prices was 4.4%. Since June 2000, while household incomes have risen on average 6.8%, average dwelling prices have soared more than two times that at 15.9%:\n \n\nIf this graph does not display, click here\nAt some point you have to admit what you‚Äôre doing has not worked. Or perhaps we need to admit that the aim all along was higher house prices.\nHoward infamously said in 2003: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get people stopping me in the street and saying, ‚ÄòJohn you‚Äôre outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased‚Äô.‚Äù\nThe tax policies he put in place worked. They ensured house prices would go up much faster than income and reduce affordability. Maybe it‚Äôs time to admit that if we keep them in place that situation will continue.\n‚Ä¢ Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work\n \n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The publisher Bloomsbury has lifted its annual profit forecasts after the latest novel from the fantasy author Sarah J Maas topped bestseller lists across the world, aided by fans recommending her books on TikTok. The British publishing company told investors that its profits for the year would be ahead of December expectations, attributing much of this to the release of Maas‚Äôs latest book, House of Flame and Shadow. The novel, which was released on 30 January, is the third book in Maas‚Äôs series that follows Bryce Quinlan, a half human, half fairy-like creature, in the fantasy Crescent City. Maas‚Äôs ‚Äúromantasy‚Äù books have gained huge popularity and House of Flame and Shadow became the number one bestseller in the US, UK, Australia and a number of other countries. In the UK, it became the third-fastest-selling fantasy novel since records began, with 44,761 copies sold in its first week. The company said the new release had also driven demand for the previous 15 books written by Maas for Bloomsbury. The publisher, which is best known for publishing the Harry Potter series, said it expected to post pre-tax profits well ahead of the consensus market expectations, which put profits at ¬£37.2m for the year up to 29 February, on a turnover of ¬£291.4m. The analyst Investec updated its forecasts for the company on Wednesday, predicting annual profits of ¬£48.1m and a turnover of ¬£329.3m. The shares rose nearly 10% to 539p, the highest point since the company listed in 1994. The publisher currently has a deal for six more titles from Maas. Her popularity has been driven by an increased presence on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, with fans sharing their love for the books with followers.    Other authors in the ‚Äúromantasy‚Äù genre, which mixes fantasy and romance, continue to experience high level of sales. The Fourth Wing series by Rebecca Yarros is popular. Her book Iron Flame recently became the bestselling fantasy book since records began, selling 57,055 in its first week last November. Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury, said the ‚Äúexceptionally strong trading period‚Äù was driven by increasing demand for fantasy fiction. ‚ÄúSarah J Maas is a publishing phenomenon and we are very fortunate to have signed her up with her first book 13 years ago. ‚ÄúHer books have a huge audience which continues to grow, backed by major Bloomsbury promotional campaigns, driving strong word-of-mouth recommendation, particularly through TikTok and Instagram channels,‚Äù said Newton. Bloomsbury also pointed to other recent publications that had helped drive sales, which included the Harry Potter Wizarding Almanac, Tom Kerridge‚Äôs cookery book Pub Kitchen, and Ghosts, the book to accompany the popular BBC comedy series."

The price of the average home decreased by 1.4% in the 12 months to December 2023, an improvement on an annual fall of 2.3% recorded in November, the Office for National Statistics said. The figures suggest that a slowdown in the housing sector in 2023 triggered by rising mortgage costs may be over, and a downward trend in house prices has bottomed out.   Related: UK house prices rise at fastest rate since January 2023   After gains of more than 20% since 2020 that added more than ¬£60,000 to the average UK house price, the latest figures show an annual drop of ¬£4,000 to ¬£285,000 in December. Prices hit a peak of ¬£291,100 in the autumn of 2022. Pent-up demand from cash buyers and first-time buyers who can access much cheaper mortgages than they could in 2023 is expected to push up prices back towards their peak this year, according to many economists. The Bank of England is forecast to cut interest rates this year from 5.25% to 4.5%, prompting lenders to cut their latest two- and five-year fixed-rate mortgage offers. Figures from the Halifax and Nationwide have shown prices bouncing back since the start of the year as mortgage loan costs tumble. Gabriella Dickens, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ‚ÄúWe expect the official measure to follow the Nationwide measure and start to rebound, as the fall in mortgage rates and recovery in real incomes boosts affordability.‚Äù England had the highest average prices of all the UK nations and it experienced the biggest fall last year, down 2.1% to ¬£302,000. Property values in Wales fell by 2.5%. Scotland had the lowest average price and a rise in prices of 3.3% to ¬£190,000, closing the gap in prices across the UK. The north-west of England had the highest annual percentage change in 2023 ‚Äì up 1.2% ‚Äì while the lowest was in London, at -4.8%. While house prices dipped in 2023, private rents continued to soar. In the two years before March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic forced the government to lockdown the economy, rental inflation averaged 1.5%. Since then, rental costs have jumped year on year before levelling off at 6% over the last four months of 2023. ‚ÄúPrivate rental prices paid by tenants in the UK rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to January 2024, unchanged for the second consecutive month,‚Äù the ONS said. ‚ÄúWithin England, London had the highest annual percentage change in private rental prices in the 12 months to January 2024, at 6.9%, while the north-east saw the lowest, at 4.7%.‚Äù "

        "content": "The billionaire brothers who own the Asda supermarket chain borrowed millions of pounds from their petrol forecourt company to repay the debt taken on to buy two private jets, it has emerged. Corporate filings revealed that Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought Asda in 2020, used their EG Group, which runs thousands of petrol stations in the UK and overseas, to lend $7m (¬£5.6m) to two private jet companies they owned in 2022. The filings, seen by the Financial Times, show more than $5m (¬£4m) handed to one Issa-owned company, which controls a Bombardier Global 6000 plane, while the remaining $2m (¬£1.6m) went to another one of their companies, which owns a smaller Bombardier plane. Both companies are registered in the Isle of Man. Last year, it was reported that EG Group had issued a ‚Ç¨39m (¬£33m) unsecured loan to the companies to buy back the jets in 2018. The two brothers‚Äô debt-laden takeover of Asda has come under scrutiny in recent months, with politicians asking questions about the structure of their ownership.   Related: Bumpy ride for billionaire brothers who banked on Asda‚Äôs success   The brothers bought Asda in 2020, alongside the private equity group TDR capital, in a deal worth ¬£6.8bn. However, the brothers put in only ¬£100m of their own cash, alongside ¬£100m from TDR Capital. The remainder was funded by the largest sterling corporate bond sale on record, according to Bloomberg, as well as a loan from the parent company of EG Group. In September, Darren Jones, the then chair of parliament‚Äôs business and trade select committee, asked for details of the retailer‚Äôs corporate structure, capital investment and profit margins on petrol. He also requested more details of loans issued by the EG Group for the purchase of the jets for the Issa brothers. In 2018, EG Group handed the private jet companies ‚Ç¨39m in unsecured, interest-free loans to buy the jets. The jet companies also borrowed money from the Bank of America, which has security over the two planes. The FT reported that the $7m of new loans made in 2022 would be enough to cover all but $1m of the amount EG reported it received in interest repayments from the two companies that year. However, a source told the paper the money was actually used to pay interest and principal ‚Äì the initial amount borrowed in a loan ‚Äì on external debt owed to third parties. EG Group said: ‚ÄúAs previously disclosed to the Financial Times in 2022, loans to the [Isle of Man] companies are fully disclosed in the EG Group accounts and continue to be so. ‚ÄúThese loans have been provided at rates comparable to the average commercial rate of interest. The interest has been identified and recognised within EG Group‚Äôs finance income.‚Äù A source said the loans were due to be repaid in full by November. Earlier this month, Mohsin Issa confirmed that he was in a relationship with Victoria Price, a former tax partner at EY. She left shortly after the firm resigned as auditor of Asda in July last year. The Telegraph also recently reported that Zuber Issa, who owns 22.5% of the supermarket, was looking to sell his shares and instead focus on the petrol forecourt business."

        "content": "Inflation remains a problem for every household, despite recent falls that have more than halved the consumer prices index since a peak in 2022. The latest figures for January show gas and electricity bills were pushed higher by Great Britain‚Äôs regulator, Ofgem, lifting the prices cap by 5%, while restaurants and hotel charges jumped 7% year on year. These price increases were the main drivers preventing the CPI from falling in January. It remained stuck at 4%, albeit slightly lower than City economists had expected. Good news came from the food industry, where inflation fell from December to January, but the annual rate remains high at 7% and food and non-alcoholic beverage prices are about 25% higher than they were two years ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Worse is the price of electricity, gas, and other fuels. Inflation for this category has fallen by 18% since its peak in January 2023. However, prices last month were 89% higher than they were in January 2021. These are dramatic increases in the cost of living. So it is no wonder the boss of the TUC, Paul Nowak, is hopping mad about any talk of lower inflation somehow meaning the problem has gone away for most people. Restaurant and hotel workers, with their colleagues in the retail industry, seem to have taken matters into their own hands in the battle against inflation, joining those at the top of the pay league ‚Äì City workers, lawyers and accountants ‚Äì as the most able to keep wages rising with inflation. The ‚Äúwholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants‚Äù category experienced the largest annual regular growth in wages to December 2023 at 7.2%; the finance and business services sector could only manage 6.9%. At the Bank of England, policymakers will be concerned that strong wage increases are flowing into higher prices and that its job of taming inflation is not yet done. The hotel and restaurant trade seems to show that trend in action. However, low-paid workers are being helped by the national minimum wage, which employers know is going up by almost 10% in April, to ¬£11.44 an hour. Like the energy price cap, this is a government initiative that the Bank cannot do anything about. Higher interest rates have no impact on whether and how these price and wage changes take effect. They are both mandated by law. That is why most economists believe the Bank will ignore these developments and cut interest rates several times this year. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, says the UK was ‚Äúclose to winning its fight against soaring inflation‚Äù. He adds that inflation‚Äôs journey back to the Bank‚Äôs 2% target should now accelerate, ‚Äúwith a sizeable fall in energy bills from April and lower food costs likely to drag inflation noticeably lower by the spring‚Äù. Nowak will be cheered by that analysis. But union members on average incomes are missing out on wage rises, and while inflation persists, no doubt their battle to claw back something like their previous living standards will, too."

        "content": "UK shop workers are facing 1,300 incidents of violence and abuse a day and a battle to control ‚Äúbrazen‚Äù acts of shoplifting, as pressure mounts on ministers to intervene to protect retail employees. Retailers saw the number of incidents of racial abuse, sexual harassment, physical assaults and threats with weapons rise 50% last year, while thefts more than doubled to 16.7m incidents, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body which represents most major retailers. The rise in retail crime has coincided with a period of rampant price inflation, with the cost of everyday goods from eggs to baby formula increasing over the past two years at a rate not seen since records began in the 1970s, leaving many families struggling to make ends meet. Some experts argue that efforts to cut labour costs by using technology such as self-checkouts have contributed to the problems, while retailers are blaming a rise in organised crime and scarce police resources. Helen Dickinson, the BRC‚Äôs chief executive, called for police to step up the number of arrests. ‚ÄúDespite retailers investing huge sums in crime prevention, violence and abuse against retail workers is climbing,‚Äù said Dickinson. ‚ÄúCriminals are being given a free pass to steal goods and to abuse and assault retail colleagues. No one should have to go to work fearing for their safety.‚Äù  Interactive  The number of thefts has quadrupled on pre-pandemic levels. Violence and abuse, which fell after a spike during the lockdowns of 2020, have jumped back up and are now three times higher than before the pandemic. The latest figures come after almost 90 retail leaders, including the bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury‚Äôs, Boots and WH Smith, wrote to the government in October demanding action on rising retail crime, as they said violent criminals were ‚Äúemptying stores‚Äù. Retailers want the government to introduce a standalone offence of assaulting, threatening, or abusing a retail worker, arguing that this would enable police to understand the scale of the issue and send a message that such crimes are being taken seriously. Under a similar law introduced in Scotland in 2021 retail crimes now carry tougher sentences and require police to record all incidents of retail crime and allow the allocation of more resources. Dickinson said: ‚ÄúWhy should our hardworking colleagues south of the border be offered less protection?‚Äù  Callout  Katy Bourne, the Sussex police and crime commissioner who is the lead for business crime at the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said the levels of retail crime being reported were ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù. ‚ÄúEvery day, retail staff are facing the consequences of shoplifters‚Äô brazen behaviour and that‚Äôs why I have supported the call for a specific offence of assault on a shop worker. ‚ÄúOur courts need to work more efficiently, and shoplifters need to be deterred from re-offending.‚Äù The Co-op, which has more than 2,000 stores across the UK, said it was installing 200 secure till kiosks, locked cabinets for bottles of spirits and AI technology to monitor self-checkouts in its supermarkets after a 44% surge in retail crime last year. It has also doubled the amount it spends on security guards.  Interactive  Last year, the fashion and homewares retailer Next‚Äôs boss, Simon Wolfson, also said he had seen a rise in shoplifting which had hit profit margins. That came after John Lewis said it suffered a ¬£12m year-on-year increase in theft with its chair, Sharon White, calling shoplifting an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù. Paul Gerrard from the Co-op said the majority of thefts were by people stealing to sell on goods in large volumes and could be accompanied by threats or abuse. ‚ÄúPeople are being followed home from work. I know of one example where we had to move people for their own safety.‚Äù He said violent theft happened in city centres and ‚Äúleafy market towns‚Äù with professional criminals moving on to other stores if extra security measures were put in place at a favoured target. Co-op stores in some areas were reporting more than two incidents a week where criminals had jumped over till kiosks to steal cigarettes, lottery cards and cash. However, Gerrard said there had been ‚Äúgreen shoots‚Äù in the past few months as a result of the government‚Äôs retail crime action plan published in October, which includes a police commitment to prioritise attending reports of shoplifting involving violence against a shop worker or where security guards have detained an offender. The plan also involves the more controversial Project Pegasus under which 10 of the country‚Äôs biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Boots and Primark, are handing CCTV images to police to be run through databases using facial recognition technology in an effort to identify prolific or potentially dangerous individuals. Gerrard said police attendance at incidents at Co-op stores had shot up to 60% from 20% in October which was ‚Äúa real step forward‚Äù. ‚ÄúUntil October there was no risk in engaging in that type of activity and now there is a real risk of being arrested and prosecuted.‚Äù A Home Office spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThe policing minister has been clear police must take a zero-tolerance approach to shoplifting. Violence against a retail worker is unacceptable, which is why we made it an aggravating offence to ensure tougher sentences for perpetrators. ‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with retailers. The police have committed to patrol more areas and attend more shoplifting incidents, especially where violence has occurred. Good progress has been made on these commitments, however we will continue working closely with police and the sector to catch more perpetrators.‚Äù"

        "content": "Tui, Europe‚Äôs biggest travel company, is abandoning the London Stock Exchange in favour of listing its shares solely in Germany. A vote on Tuesday resulted in 98.35% of shareholders backing a company proposal to drop its UK listing, in what will be seen as the latest blow to London‚Äôs standing in international finance. The company said the result showed ‚Äúthere was a very clear vote in favour of delisting from the London Stock Exchange‚Äù. The move ‚Äì which will see Tui retain its dual listing on the Hanover and Frankfurt exchanges ‚Äì is expected to take place early this summer. The company had argued to shareholders that the axing of London would simplify its structure and improve liquidity, with some investors suggesting that shares traded solely in Germany could lower costs and provide ‚Äúsupport for EU airline ownership‚Äù.  Tui has said about 77% of share transactions are settled directly via the German share register, while less than a quarter of trading in Tui shares is in the form of UK depositary interests. Trading of Tui shares has previously attracted scrutiny. An attempted transfer in March 2022 of a large stake owned by the Russian steel, mining and banking tycoon Alexei Mordashov resulted in a criminal investigation in Cyprus, after an international media expos√© raised questions about a potential sanctions breach. Mordashov‚Äôs stake remains frozen. Tuesday‚Äôs vote will also be viewed through a national lens and will be considered as the latest setback for the London stock market. Last month, the betting company Flutter listed in New York and said it would switch its primary listing from London, with shareholders due to vote on the proposal in May. Last year, the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, one of the UK‚Äôs few bona fide global tech success stories, snubbed London in favour of floating on the Nasdaq in New York, in one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years. Tui‚Äôs stock exchange switch, which required 75% of votes at the virtual AGM, came on a day that the company also reported a surprise profit and record revenues in the Christmas quarter on strong demand for travel.  The travel firm reported an unexpected profit of ‚Ç¨6m (¬£5.1m) in the final quarter of last year, compared with a loss of ‚Ç¨153m in the same period in 2022. Revenues soared 15% year on year to ‚Ç¨4.3bn, a record for the quarter, which the company said was driven by higher demand at improved prices and rates. Sebastian Ebel, the chief executive of Tui, said: ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs willingness to travel is still high, despite a market environment that remains challenging. We are on track, we are gaining customers and we are growing. We are accelerating our transformation quarter by quarter.‚Äù Tui, which cut its debt from ‚Ç¨5.3bn to ‚Ç¨4bn by the end of last year, maintained its full-year forecast of a 10% increase in revenues and a 25% uplift in profits. The company said winter and summer bookings were up 8% year on year, and average prices were up 4%. Tui has 9.4m bookings for winter and summer combined, up on 8.7m last year."

        "content": "  4.01pm GMT  Closing post  Time for a recap‚Ä¶ The Body Shop has collapsed into administration in the UK less than three months after it was taken over by a private equity company, in a move that puts more than 2,200 jobs at risk at the cosmetics chain. Aurelius, the German company that bought The Body Shop for ¬£207m in November, said it had been unable to revive the fortunes of the business after dismal trading over Christmas and new year. Aurelius confirmed it had appointed the accounting firm FRP Advisory as the administrator, raising concerns over the future of the business founded by the late environmental and human rights campaigner Anita Roddick in 1976. The Body Shop has almost 200 shops in the UK as well as a distribution centre and head office. Here‚Äôs the full story:   Related: The Body Shop collapses into administration in UK   Hopes of early interest rate cuts have faded on both sides of the Atlantic, after the latest economic data. In the UK, wage growth slowed by less than expected at the end of last year, with average earnings (excluding bonuses) rising by 6.2% per year in the October-December quarter and total pay growth (including bonuses), down to 5.8%. Both fell from 6.7%. Adjusted for inflation, real earnings were the strongest since summer 2021. Analysts at Nomura predict the Bank of England might not cut interest rates until August.   Related: UK pay growth slows less than expected as workers bid up wages   But while the unemployment rate fell, the number of people out of work due to sickness remained worryingly high, while vacancies fell.   Related: Buoyant UK labour market data belies rise in long-term sickness   In another blow to central bankers, US inflation was higher than forecast in January. The US CPI index slowed to 3.1% in January, higher than the 2.9% forecast, which dampened the odds of rate cuts in March or May. Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says:  We‚Äôll likely have to wait for the second half of the year for the Fed to start cutting, but the issue isn‚Äôt so much whether the bank will cut rates this year, as that is an almost certainty at this point, but how many rate cuts there will be. The year started with 150 bps of cuts being priced in. That has now dropped to 96 bps ‚Äì or just under four 25bps cuts.

But now stores like Lush hold the bigger pocket money draw for tweens and teens, lured in by fragrant bath bombs and innovative product ingredients.      3.30pm GMT   Body Shop stores could be forced to close unless a buyer is found for them, warns Roger Hutton, insolvency expert at law firm Clarion. Following the appointment of FRP Advisory as administrators today, Hutton says:  News that Body Shop has collapsed into administration isn‚Äôt a surprise, given its run of financial challenges.  And with businesses trading against the economic backdrop of tighter lending and higher cost inflation, it‚Äôs a difficult environment for the retail sector as a whole.  While the Body Shop stores will continue to remain open while the firm is in administration, if a buyer for its stores is not found soon, they may be forced to close.  While it‚Äôs unclear whether this could have been prevented, the earlier a business gets advice the better. The earlier interventions are taken, the more solutions there are, such as securing financing on better terms, allowing more time to engage with shareholders and getting a head start on restructuring.  Now, time is of the essence here to secure the future of the brand. The focus needs to be on the UK arm of the business and effectively communicating a plan to employees and creditors.‚Äù      2.37pm GMT   Appointing administrators will hopefully act as a springboard for The Body Shop‚Äôs future survival, says Jason Freedman, fraud and asset recovery partner at the law firm Gowling WLG.  While drastic changes will need to be made to its business model, the significant resonance which the brand still has with consumers can still be capitalised on if operational changes and a focus on cost reductions at all levels can be aligned with delivering against customer needs.  ‚ÄúThat insolvencies are increasing will be of no surprise to anyone who has been paying any attention to the economy recently, Freedman adds:  Companies continue to weather the storms of Brexit, labour shortages and high inflation, often with balance sheets that are struggling to recover from the hit of the pandemic, and with the cost-of-living crisis hitting employees and customers alike. Now, a prolonged higher interest rate environment is chipping away at margins and threatening to pick companies off as they need to refinance.  Directors of struggling companies need to be aware that there are many options now available to them to save or rescue their businesses, as long as they get the right advice as early as possible and engage with key stakeholders. The longer this is delayed, the fewer options remain.‚Äù      2.25pm GMT   Today‚Äôs fall into administration comes 48 years after environmentalist and human rights activist Anita Roddick founded The Body Shop, in Brighton, in March 1976. It was bought by cosmetics giant L‚ÄôOreal in 2006. But after an unhappy decade, The Body Shop was sold again, to Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura&Co for ‚Ç¨1bn in 2017.

Putting the business through administration will give immediate respite from creditors and allow a leaner, viable business to emerge, albeit with substantial creditor casualties in the form of suppliers and landlords. As with Wilko, the business left standing is likely to be focussed on its online offering.‚Äù      1.52pm GMT   The news that The Body Shop was heading into administration has sparked a flurry of reminiscences on social media, and memories of much-loved products:  Quite sad about The Body Shop news - it was one of my childhood happy places, showed us you could have fun with beauty products as well as care about the planet and the satsuma lip balm could not be beaten https://t.co/5PjZ7YDHYH‚Äî Kirsty Weakley (@KirstyWeakley) February 13, 2024   Weirdly sad about The Body Shop. Of course, I've not shopped there for years and Lush stole a lot of the market. Dewberry and White Musk will last forever (just like the smell would on your clothes).‚Äî Cath Feely (@cathfeely) February 13, 2024   I'm quite sad about this. As a teenager, pre Internet, the Body Shop not only bought White Musk into my life, but also made me aware of social issues.

Having said that I hadn‚Äôt bought anything for years #ripbodyshop‚Äî Dr Lucy Woollett (Lady Lucy) (@ydalycul) February 13, 2024   Updated at 2.01pm GMT    1.47pm GMT  US inflation higher than expected, at 3.1%  Shortly after The Body Shop‚Äôs fall into administration was announced, new data showed inflation in the US has slowed ‚Äì but not by as much as expected. The headline rate of US inflation fell to 3.1% in January, down from 3.4% in December, but higher than the 2.9% reading which economists expected. This may make it harder for America‚Äôs central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates soon (it has a 2% inflation target).  JUST IN: U.S. inflation was 3.1% (y/y) in January, down significantly from 6.4% a year ago.Falling prices for energy and many goods are really helping inflation cool off.**Rent and car insurance/repair are the big drivers of inflation now.** pic.twitter.com/J29rzTM7D6‚Äî Heather Long (@byHeatherLong) February 13, 2024  Bryce Doty, Senior VP and Senior PM at Sit Investment Associates, says:  From the Fed‚Äôs perspective, economic growth is strong enough that there isn‚Äôt a sense of urgency on cutting rates. While I‚Äôm not forecasting a recession, there are a number of warning signs that the consumer is stretched thin financially. Not only are credit card balances at all-time highs, people are also increasingly choosing ‚Äúbuy now and pay later‚Äù options. Another canary in the coal mine is the degree of complaining about food inflation even though most food prices have stabilized. It tells me that household finances are tight. We expect consumer buying habits to shift towards necessities over luxury goods. Economic growth will slow, but continue to be strong enough to keep the Fed from cutting rates longer than they should. In the meantime, bond investors will get to enjoy higher yields a little while longer than many thought.‚Äù   Updated at 1.48pm GMT    1.40pm GMT   The administrators taking control of The Body Shop have a number of options. Jeremy Whiteson, restructuring and insolvency partner at legal firm Fladgate, explains:  Administrators have broad powers including to sell a business as a going concern, continue the trade, or break up the business and sell stock, brand and other assets.  Which of these routes they take will depend on the state of the company and the level of interest of potential buyers.  The administrators should try to act in the best interest of creditors. This makes for a worrying time for the staff of the groups‚Äô 200 stores.  High street retailers are having a tough time, Whiteson adds:  They have been besieged by multiple challenges- the pandemic, restricted supplies after Brexit, tighter labour markets (leading to upward pressure on wages) and high fuel costs. For Body Shop, with its private equity owners, there is likely to be substantial debt that poses an additional concern as high interest rates increase the burden on the company.  It is hoped that a solution can be found which safeguards the jobs of staff. However, it seems likely that many buyers will simply be interested in the brand and stock, shifting the business to an online operation or to be integrated into a multi-brand retailer (such as Next or Frasers).      1.37pm GMT  Heightened competition to blame for The Body Shop‚Äôs downfall, says GlobalData  Unable to keep up with its rivals, The Body Shop‚Äôs demise into administration comes as a result of increased competition in a thriving health & beauty market, say GlobalData analyst Tash Van Boxel. GlobalData forecasts that the UK health & beauty market rose 7.1% in 2023 ‚Äì but while rivals such as Boots and Superdrug outperformed the market, The Body Shop has lagged behind. Van Boxel adds:  ‚ÄúThe Body Shop‚Äôs success in the past was down to its distinct brand identity, with its focus on natural ingredients and fairtrade products being at the fore of its marketing, making the retailer ahead of its time.  While The Body Shop continues to stand by its ethical and cruelty-free brand values, these claims have become industry standards, weakening The Body Shop‚Äôs point of difference. Indeed, not only are brands now offering products with similar claims, but they also bring more to the table to attract shoppers. For example, The Ordinary‚Äôs products are cruelty-free and vegan, but it also highlights its science-backed formulas at low price points.‚Äù       1.32pm GMT  Full story: The Body Shop collapses into administration in UK  The Body Shop has more than 200 UK stores. Sources familiar with the situation said they expected the brand to survive in some form but with far fewer shops. It employs more than 2,000 people in the UK.

Tony Wright, Geoff Rowley, and Alastair Massey of business advisory firm FRP have been appointed as Joint Administrators of The Body Shop‚Äôs UK business. They will consider ‚Äúall options‚Äù to find a way forward for the business, and will ‚Äúupdate creditors and employees in due course‚Äù. A statement just released from the administrators says:  The Body Shop remains guided by its ambition to be a modern, dynamic beauty brand, relevant to customers and able to compete for the long term. Creating a more nimble and financially stable UK business, is an important step in achieving this.  The Body Shop will continue to trade, with shops and the online site remaining open and making sales while the administrators conduct its restructuring. The statement adds:  The Body Shop has faced an extended period of financial challenges under past owners, coinciding with a difficult trading environment for the wider retail sector. Having taken swift action in the last month, including closing down The Body Shop At Home and selling its business across most of Europe and in parts of Asia, focusing on the UK business is the next important step in The Body Shop‚Äôs restructuring.  The Body Shop said last night that they intended to appoint administrators. The move comes just three months after private equity firm Aurelius bought The Body Shop for ¬£207m. The process is likely to cause dozens of shop closures, putting jobs at risk and threatening a crucial source of sales for a global network of small farmers and producers.   Related: The Body Shop files intention to appoint administrators    Updated at 2.50pm GMT    1.09pm GMT   Oil cartel Opec is sticking with its forecast for higher demand over the next two years. In its latest monthly report, Opec forecasts global oil demand growth of 2.2m barrels per day in 2024, and 1.8m barrels per day in 2025. Opec has also nudged up its estimates for world economic growth this year to 2.7%, up from 2.6%, and to 2.9% in 2025, from 2.8%. The report says:  Global economic growth exceeded expectations in both 3Q23 and 4Q23, and the consistent momentum towards the end of the year is expected to carry over into 2024.      12.41pm GMT  UK housing market has \"turned the page\" in January  The UK property market strengthened in January, new data from estate agent Hamptons shows. Hamptons reports that there‚Äôs been a steep fall in the number of price reductions, while the pressure on sellers to accept offers below their asking price fell as houses sold faster than a year ago. Here‚Äôs the details:  In January, sellers were less likely to cut their asking price than at any time over the last eight months. 48% of homes sold in January across England & Wales had been subject to a price reduction, down from a peak of 55% in October 2023. The average seller in England & Wales sold their home last month for 98.9% of their asking price, up from 98.5% in both December 2023 and January 2023.  9% of homes that came onto the market in January sold within a week, up from 6% in January 2023‚Ä¶ but lower than in January 2021 when 19% of homes sold within a week.  Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said:  ‚ÄúThe early signs in 2024 suggest that the market has firmly turned the page. Falling mortgage rates have been the primary catalyst, tempting last year‚Äôs missing movers to restart their property search. Consequently, more households were looking to buy last month than in any January over the last decade, including the start of both 2021 and 2022.  ‚ÄúFirst-time buyers and second steppers, who tend to be most reliant on mortgage finance, are at the forefront of the recovery. This injection of demand is starting to stabilise house price falls, particularly for mid to lower-priced homes, which should also improve selling conditions further up the chain as the year progresses. That said, the affordability picture is still more challenging than it was a few years ago which will keep a tight lid on price growth.‚Äù      12.32pm GMT   Kevin Boscher, chief investment officer at investment group Ravenscroft, predicts the first UK interest rate cut will come in May ‚Äì with up to one percentage point of cuts coming this year:  Whilst inflation surprises positively and hits its 2% target earlier than expected, we think the MPC will remain cautious given ‚Äústicky‚Äù services inflation, rising disposable incomes and wage inflation which is still on the high side although falling rapidly. We expect the MPC to cut rates by 0.75%-1% this year starting in May.      11.57am GMT   Global investors are more optimistic that the world economy will avoid being driven into recession by high borrowing costs. The latest poll of investors, from Bank of America, has found that 62% of respondents think the US economy will stay robust, surging up from 28% last month. The proportion expecting an immediate US slowdown due to monetary tightening (high interest rates) has almost halved, falling from 61% to 32%. Growth pessimism in Europe remains pronounced, however, with 62% expecting a weaker European economy given the drag from monetary tightening, down from 83% last month.     11.22am GMT   Troubled social housing investor Home REIT has told the City that it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The FCA has begun an investigation, covering the period from 22 September 2020 to 3 January 2023, Home REIT says, adding:  Naturally, the Company will cooperate fully with the FCA in its work.  Home REIT invests in the provision of sheltered housing for homeless people throughout the UK. Last year it fell into crisis as tenants withheld rent due to problems with its properties, such as black mould and leaking ceilings. It has also been targetted by short sellers, with one claiming its properties were overvalued and questioned its tenants‚Äô ability to pay rent.

And policymakers will have noted that the oil price has hit its highest level in over two weeks this morning. Brent crude has climbed by over 1%, to as high as $82.95 per barrel, the highest since 30 January.

Overall, he forecasts five quarter-point cuts this year, as pay growth continues to slow.  So far, the BoE has managed to pull off a mostly soft landing for the economy, while enabling a Goldilocks scenario for the labour market. But it is too soon to declare a complete victory. Even though money market rates have fallen in anticipation of forthcoming rate cuts, past rate hikes are still feeding through the housing market and to businesses that are rolling over debt. To keep the labour market on track and to underpin a broader recovery in economic activity in 2024, the BoE will need to start to take its foot off the brake soon. A likely further easing of wage growth over coming months should give BoE policymakers the confidence to start cutting rates from Q2 onwards. We continue to look for the first 25bp cut in June and five cuts overall in 2024 ‚Äì lowering the bank rate from 5.25% to 4% by year-end.

Raja points to the drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8%, from 3.9%, and the stronger-than-expected wage growth:  The jobless rate ‚Äì for what it‚Äôs worth ‚Äì inched lower. Wage growth was a little stickier than we anticipated. And vacancies didn‚Äôt see the drop we expected. Overall, today‚Äôs data leans more hawkishly for an MPC looking for sufficient evidence that the labour market is cooling  He adds:  Despite the slowdown in pay growth, today‚Äôs wage data leans a little more hawkishly ‚Äì the MPC was projecting private sector pay growth to slip to 6% (3m/YoY) in Dec-23.

The executive and supervisory board of Tui, which is listed on the FTSE 250 and in Frankfurt, has recommended that shareholders vote in favour of a single listing in Germany at the company‚Äôs annual general meeting on Tuesday.   Related: Tui delivers record results in run-up to potential London exit   Shares in TUI have risen 3% in early trading. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says:  Despite pressures from the cost-of-living crisis, individuals and families continue to prioritise their trips abroad. Tui has managed to uphold demand even while simultaneously increasing prices, highlighting how the business holds significant pricing power to pass on additional cost pressures to consumers. Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange could be bracing for yet another blow, as Tui prepares to decide on whether to abandon its London listing. The travel operator is just the latest in a slew of businesses considering fleeing the LSE, to list in rival financial hubs instead like New York or Frankfurt. This comes after a period of weak price action in the UK post Brexit, resulting in discounted valuations for UK stocks. Just this week shares in Arm have taken to the skies in New York, a painful reminder of that nasty blow to London‚Äôs public markets.‚Äù      9.36am GMT  Analysis: Buoyant UK labour market data belies rise in long-term sickness  On the face of it, Britain‚Äôs labour market is in rude health, but the underlying picture is less cheery, our economics editor Larry Elliott explains:  Employment rose in the final three months of 2023 and unemployment fell to 3.8%. Earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose for a sixth successive month. All are traditionally signs of strength ‚Äì not an economy that may well have been in recession in the second half of last year. Scratch beneath the surface and things look less rosy. The latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that one reason the jobs market is running so hot is because of a lack of workers caused by long-term ill-health. The number of people inactive for health reasons was 2.8 million by the end of 2023 ‚Äì a rise of more than 200,000 on the year and a jump of 700,000 since before the Covid pandemic. In a literal sense, this is a sick economy. The absence from the labour market of so many potential workers has consequences. There are still a high number of job vacancies, even though the economy has been flatlining for the best part of two years. While vacancies have been on a downward trend throughout this period, at 932,000 they are still above pre-Covid levels.  More here.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said annual growth in regular earnings, excluding bonuses, was 6.2% in October to December 2023, while pay rises including bonuses was 5.8%. City economists expected average earnings in the UK to drop significantly in the three months to December to 6% excluding bonuses and 5.6% including bonuses. The modest fall will pose a dilemma for the Bank of England, which has signalled that pay rises need to moderate before it cuts interest rates. After wages were adjusted for inflation, the ONS said workers enjoyed a fourth month of real wage increases. Total pay rose on the year by 1.6% above the consumer prices index and regular pay rose on the year by 1.9% in October to December 2023.

The number of those classed as economically inactive in the jobs market rose to 9.3 million in the final quarter of last year, with another jump in those off work due to long-term sickness, to a record 2.8 million, up 8.4% year on year. The number of people economically inactive because they were looking after the family or home, or temporarily sick, fell ‚Äì leaving the overall inactivity rate unchanged at 21.5%. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak says:  ‚ÄúThese figures show how people‚Äôs lives are being held back by the government‚Äôs failure to invest in our NHS. 2.8 million people are out of work because of long-term sickness and the numbers are still rising. ‚ÄúAverage pay is still worth ¬£12 a week less than before the financial crisis 16 years ago and more than a million people are on zero hours contracts. The Conservative legacy is low pay, ill health and more job insecurity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for change.

They say this morning‚Äôs labour market data was stronger than expected, adding:  Although BoE governor Bailey said that March was live for cuts, we think stronger- than-expected wage growth and a still tightening labour market support the Bank cutting only in August.  December wage growth was stronger than expected, with upward revisions to the November print. The unemployment rate declined, compared with forecasts for a rise. We think the Bank of England will likely continue to wait for a bit longer before it begins its cutting cycle, owing to heightened uncertainty and volatility over labour market and inflation data, opting for a ‚Äúdelayed reaction function‚Äù as Ben Broadbent has previously indicated.      8.30am GMT  Pound hits six-month high against the euro  The pound has hit its highest level against the euro since last August.

The ONS says:  Annual average regular earnings growth for the public sector was 5.8% in October to December 2023, which is not as high as it has been in recent periods but remains relatively strong; for the private sector this was 6.2%, with growth last lower than this in May to July 2022 (6.0%).      8.08am GMT  Vacancy numbers fall  There are still over 900,000 vacancies across the UK economy, despite another drop in the number of job opportunities. The ONS says the stimated number of vacancies in November-January fell by 26,000 to 932,000. On an annual basis, there are 209,000 fewer vacancies than a year ago, although the total is still higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic: Alexandra Hall-Chen, Principal Policy Advisor for Employment at the Institute of Directors, says businesses are still struggling to access the labour and skills that they need to thrive:  ‚ÄúThe increase in the economic inactivity rate over the past year, driven by historically high numbers of people reporting being long-term sick, is a particularly worrying sign of structural issues in the UK labour market.  Taken together with the government‚Äôs upcoming changes to legal migration rules, it is clear that urgent action is needed from government to increase domestic labour supply at the upcoming Spring Budget. Such measures should include delivering on the promised expansion to childcare provision and implementing measures to widen access to occupational health services.‚Äù      7.52am GMT   The UK labour market ‚Äúcontinues to face challenges‚Äù as wage growth falls and long-term sickness remain historically high. So says Ben Harrison, Director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, adding:  ‚ÄúFor millions the cost of living crisis is not over, and yet the tide is continuing to turn on pay.  ‚ÄúData shows there are now 2.8 million people who are economic inactive due to long-term sickness, which is at one of the highest levels since records began in 1993. The recently revised ONS figures show that since before the pandemic, the UK now has just under 700,000 more working age adults out of the labour market due to work due ill health.      7.48am GMT   Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has welcomed the news that real wages (earnings adjusted for inflation) have risen again, saying:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good news that real wages are on the up for the sixth month in a row and unemployment remains low, but the job isn‚Äôt done. Our tax cuts are part of a plan to get people back to work so we can grow the economy - but we must stick with it.‚Äù      7.44am GMT  Pay growth slows: what the experts say  City experts believe the Bank of England will want to see a larger drop in pay growth before it feels confident it can cut interest rates. Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, explains:  The recent trend lower in inflation, while good news, has largely been driven by a collapse in goods prices. The key watch item for the Bank lies in whether consumption reaccelerates as consumers find their feet. This would be good for growth but would also present upside risks to inflation, particularly in services sectors where prices tend to be more closely linked to wages. As a result, with today‚Äôs print pointing to some signs of slowing in a still strong labour market, significantly more evidence of cooling is likely required before the Bank is ready to consider cutting rates.‚Äù  Jake Finney, economist at PwC UK, predicts that workers will see inflation-beating pay rises this year:  ‚ÄúThe latest data suggests the UK has achieved its sweet spot, with declining vacancies taking the heat out of the labour market whilst unemployment remains relatively flat. This view is supported by the nominal pay growth data, which continues to soften. ‚ÄúHowever, the lingering concern for the Bank of England will be that the labour market has not cooled sufficiently to achieve a sustainable return to the 2% inflation target. This remains one of the key barriers to the base rate cut in May that markets are currently expecting.  ‚ÄúMore positively, workers will welcome that pay is now growing in real terms. With inflation declining at a faster pace than pay growth, workers are likely to see real term pay rises throughout most of 2024.‚Äù  Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the slower-than-expected easing in wage growth may mean the Bank doesn‚Äôt need to rush to cut interest rates (but tomorrow‚Äôs inflation report will also be important):  While wage growth fell further in December, evidence that the labour market may not be loosening much suggests wage growth may not fall as fast as we expect.      7.34am GMT  Not too important if UK enters shallow recession, Bank of England's Bailey says  Today‚Äôs jobs data comes in a busy week for economic news ‚Äì with inflation statistics due tomorrow, followed by GDP on Thursday. The growth figues may show that Britain fell into a technical recession at the end of 2023. But last night, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last night that he wasn‚Äôt overly concerned about a small drop in GDP in October-December. Speaking after giving a lecture on banking at Loughborough University, he said he wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúput too much weight on that,‚Äù explaining:  ‚ÄúIf we do get two successive negative quarters ... it will be very shallow. What I would put more weight on is that the indicators we have seen since have shown some signs of upturn.‚Äù   Lecture by Andrew Bailey Governor of Bank of England at Loughborough University pic.twitter.com/1KEJbOdtOV‚Äî Cwm Tillery (@chakonthemove) February 12, 2024   Updated at 8.02am GMT    7.34am GMT  Introduction: UK wage growth slows, but beating inflation  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK wage growth has slowed, as the jobs market continues to cool, but continues to outpace inflation. Average earnings (excluding bonuses) grew by 6.2% per year in the October-December quarter, new data from the Office for National Statistics this morning shows, down from 6.7% the month earlier. Total pay growth (including bonuses), slowed to 5.8% from 6.7%. Both readings are higher than the City expected. Much, but not all, of this wage growth is being eaten up by inflation, which ended 2023 at 4%. If you strip out CPI inflation, then real total earnings rose by 1.6%, and regular pay grew by 1.9% ‚Äì growth was last higher in July to September 2021. That should help workers through the cost-of-living squeeze, but may disappoint the Bank of England which is looking for signs that inflationary pressures are easing.  Headline indicators for the UK labour market for October to December 2023 show:‚ñ™Ô∏è employment was 75.0%‚ñ™Ô∏è unemployment was 3.8%‚ñ™Ô∏è economic inactivity was 21.9%‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/uUfa4WRA2u pic.twitter.com/9tmBH70gLz‚Äî Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 13, 2024  Today‚Äôs jobs report also shows that the number of payrolled employees in the UK rose by 31,000 between November and December 2023, and rose by 401,000 over the year. The unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8%, a rate last seen a year earlier in October to December 2022. The employment rate rose to 75.0%, but the ONS warns that employment growth has slowed. And the economic inactivity rate remains worryingly high at 21.9%, having been driven up last year by a rise in long-term sickness. ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown says:  ‚ÄúIt is clear that growth in employment has slowed over the past year. Over the same period the proportion of people neither working nor looking for work has risen, with historically high numbers of people saying they are long-term sick. ‚ÄúJob vacancies fell again, for the nineteenth consecutive month. However, there are signs this trend may now be slowing. ‚ÄúThe number of days lost to strikes went up in December, with the majority coming from the health sector. ‚ÄúIn cash terms earnings are growing more slowly than in recent months, but in real terms they remain positive, thanks to falling inflation.‚Äù  The agenda  7am GMT: UK labour market report 10am GMT: ZEW index of eurozone economic sentiment index 1.30pm GMT: US inflation report for January   "

        "content": "Walking into The Body Shop was like ‚Äúentering a sweet shop‚Äù. It ‚Äúliterally made your mouth water‚Äù, says Stasia Smith-Turpin, who would head to the Lancaster store after school with friends when she was 16 in the 90s. She recalls how a wave of fragrance would hit her as she entered the shop, and she would test and smell the soaps, creams and potions while planning how to spend her pocket money.  Smith-Turpin, 48, would spray herself with dewberry perfume ‚Äì the scent of summer berries ‚Äì before riding the bus home. One day, to her mother‚Äôs horror, she applied too much (‚Äúmy arms were literally greasy!‚Äù) and ‚Äúapparently she could smell me from the bus stop at the bottom of the hill‚Äù, she says. Since The Body Shop was founded in 1976, it has served as a gateway to adolescence for generations of young people like Smith-Turpin. Now she and other consumers feel sadness and regret as the retailer collapses into administration in a move that is likely to lead to significant store closures and job losses. ‚ÄúIt was the beginnings of a scented awakening for most teenage girls, and my god did we smell ‚Äì beautiful, but really strong,‚Äù says Smith-Turpin, now a management consultant in Hampton. But it wasn‚Äôt just the products that attracted Smith-Turpin to The Body Shop. It stood for something: ethical consumption, environmentally sustainable ingredients, an abhorrence of animal testing. The store ‚Äúopened my eyes to many of the political issues I still feel strongly about today‚Äù, she says. Smith-Turpin bought a book on vegetarianism from The Body Shop around the time she stopped eating meat at 16. ‚ÄúIt was the spark that made me go and find out more,‚Äù she says. The Body Shop in the late 1970s represented the height of cool, recalls Helen Gunn, a 64-year-old retired occupational therapist in Herefordshire. ‚ÄúThere weren‚Äôt any shops like it at the time,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI remember the delicious smells of apple, dewberry and grapefruit.‚Äù She also liked how the business, which now has more than 200 UK stores, was a model for women, and how the founder, Anita Roddick, believed natural cosmetics could be feminist. Gunn ‚Äúreally admired the way she ran her business in a male-dominated world. She was a successful woman in an age where it was unusual for women to make headway in any business.‚Äù She adds: ‚ÄúI feel really sad that it has foundered.‚Äù  Roddick eventually sold up in 2006 to L‚ÄôOr√©al and the company was eventually bought by the private equity firm Aurelius Group last year in a cut-price deal. In 1985, Sally-Ann Fawcett remembers applying for a job at The Body Shop in Scarborough. ‚ÄúThe competition was ferocious,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEveryone wanted to work in such a cool, trendy shop, and the group interview at a five-star local hotel was akin to a beauty pageant.‚Äù Fawcett, 56, was gutted not to be hired. ‚ÄúWe were all so envious of those who were successful,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt really was the place to be.‚Äù Every applicant was given a product as a thank you, and she got a banana shampoo. ‚ÄúIt was the start of a love affair that has lasted 40 years since that day,‚Äù Fawcett says. Lara Callister, 42, from the Isle of Man, began visiting The Body Shop as a teen in the 90s. ‚ÄúI loved the whole ethos and style,‚Äù she says, adding that she was attracted to its strong values of responsible consumption and anti-animal testing stance. ‚ÄúThe actual products themselves were so fragrant and really useful, I adored their morello cherry lip balm, fuzzy peach and dewberry scented products and peppermint foot lotion,‚Äù she says. But Callister says she visited less after the chain‚Äôs 2006 sale to L‚ÄôOr√©al, after which it became ‚Äúbland and uninviting‚Äù. She is ‚Äúvery sad‚Äù but not surprised to hear that it has called in administrators. ‚ÄúAsset stripping has been mentioned and it just leaves you with that sinking feeling of another empty shop for the high street,‚Äù she says. Hilary Ellis, a 66-year-old semi-retired career coach, lives in Hove, not far from the first ever Body Shop, which opened in Brighton in 1976. At the time it felt like an ‚Äúeco-conscious emporium of beauty products ‚Äì nowhere else had toiletries, cosmetics and wellbeing products under one roof,‚Äù she says. The eye shadows were among Ellis‚Äôs favourite products ‚Äì they were affordable, subtle and cruelty-free ‚Äì as well as the essential oils in little glass tubes. Ellis travelled around for work, ‚Äúso I carried them everywhere,‚Äù she says, with the lavender helping her sleep on planes or in hotels. ‚ÄúIt all went downhill when Anita Roddick died‚Äù in 2007, Ellis says. ‚ÄúShe was an entrepreneur with a revolutionary ethical approach.‚Äù After being sold to L‚ÄôOr√©al in 2006, the company was bought by the beauty giant Natura in 2017 before its private equity acquisition in 2023. Ellis believes now is the time ‚Äúwe need someone to make a fresh start for affordable ethical beauty on our high streets‚Äù."

        "content": "The Body Shop has collapsed into administration in the UK less than three months after it was taken over by a private equity company, in a move that puts more than 2,200 jobs at risk at the cosmetics chain. Aurelius, the German company that bought The Body Shop for ¬£207m in November, said it had been unable to revive the fortunes of the business after dismal trading over Christmas and new year. Aurelius confirmed it had appointed the accounting firm FRP Advisory as the administrator, raising concerns over the future of the business founded by the late environmental and human rights campaigner Anita Roddick in 1976. The Body Shop has almost 200 shops in the UK as well as a distribution centre and head office.   Related: ‚ÄòScent of a generation‚Äô: the Body Shop products consumers loved   In a statement, the administrators said: ‚ÄúToday, the directors of The Body Shop International Limited have appointed Tony Wright, Geoff Rowley, and Alastair Massey of business advisory firm FRP as Joint Administrators of the company, which operates The Body Shop‚Äôs UK business.‚Äù The company, they said, had ‚Äúfaced an extended period of financial challenges under past owners, coinciding with a difficult trading environment for the wider retail sector‚Äù and they would ‚Äúconsider all options to find a way forward for the business and will update creditors and employees in due course‚Äù. Last month Aurelius closed down the direct sales business, The Body Shop at Home, and sold off its stores in Europe and parts of Asia ‚Äì which are understood to have been loss-making. Sources familiar with the situation said they expected the brand to survive in some form but with far fewer shops. Aurelius itself is thought to be a likely buyer for a honed down business ‚Äì with perhaps only 100 stores ‚Äì but it is clear that administrators have already been in touch with other potentially interested parties. Industry bidders such as Next are thought to be among those interested. Next has acquired a stable of brands, from Cath Kidston to Fatface, which it now stocks in its high street stores and online. It is a trend that has gathered pace as internet sales have dented bricks and mortar retail, with Argos and Habitat now part of Sainsbury‚Äôs and Frasers Group snapping up dozens of brands from Agent Provocateur to Jack Wills. One beauty industry expert said The Body Shop was not a brand that could work as a wholesale collection on other retailers‚Äô shelves and would need a chain to ensure the details of its ethical sourcing were properly communicated. ‚ÄúIf you stick a few products on a shelf in Boots you would lose the magic,‚Äù the source said. Mass store closures affecting the remainder of the business would mark the latest stage in the decline of a brand that Roddick and her husband, Gordon, built into a worldwide symbol of fair and sustainable trading. Roddick opened her first shop in Brighton in 1976, expanding rapidly through a franchise model and adhering to strict moral principles. The company remained under family ownership for three decades until they sold it to the French cosmetics corporation L‚ÄôOr√©al, the owner of Maybelline and Garnier, for ¬£652m in 2006. Roddick died the following year. By then, The Body Shop had become synonymous with its ethical positions, including a refusal to stock products tested on animals and the sourcing of natural ingredients that were traded ethically. The decision to sell to a global corporation disappointed many loyal customers and cleared the way for rivals such as Lush, Neal‚Äôs Yard and Aesop to step in. As The Body Shop‚Äôs sales and profits flagged, L‚ÄôOr√©al sold it on to Brazil‚Äôs Natura, a more natural fit as the owner of Australian natural beauty brand Aesop. However, it then went on to buy the home-selling cosmetics group Avon in 2019, a badly timed deal that left it with a hefty debt pile as the Covid pandemic hit and then interest rates began to rise around the world. Natura decided to focus on its core Latin American market and clear its debts by selling Aesop and The Body Shop, with Aurelius one of few bidders to come close to the asking price. The administrators said ‚Äúfocusing on the UK business is the next important step in The Body Shop‚Äôs restructuring‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúTaking this approach provides the stability, flexibility and security to find the best means of securing the future of The Body Shop and revitalising this iconic British brand.‚Äù"

        "content": "The head of Britain‚Äôs post-Brexit trade watchdog has said it is ready to follow Brussels in launching an investigation into Chinese companies flooding the market for electric cars, but the government has not asked it to do so. Oliver Griffiths, the chief executive of the UK‚Äôs Trade Remedies Authority (TRA), which advises the government on trade defence, said it was keeping lines of communication open with ministers and had been in close contact with the car industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be ready to go if anyone does come to us,‚Äù he told the Guardian in an interview. The European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) late last year after warning that global markets were being ‚Äúflooded‚Äù with cheap imports from the world‚Äôs second largest economy.   Related: Forget range anxiety: we should really worry about China‚Äôs global dominance in the electric car market | John Naughton   Britain would have been covered by the inquiry as a member state but has led an independent trade policy since leaving the EU four years ago. Under the UK‚Äôs post-Brexit system, the TRA can be called on by ministers or industry to investigate whether import controls are needed to protect Britain‚Äôs economic interests. However, Griffiths said no request by the government or carmakers had been made since Brussels launched its investigation in October. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had either of those two things happen on electric vehicles. But I know people are watching it really closely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been in close and regular contact with the industry on this one, and lots of people are looking at the import numbers. Similarly, I know government have a fairly close watching brief on this one. All eyes will be on Brussels later on this year when they could potentially bring out an interim measure on this.‚Äù Chinese carmakers including BYD and Nio are hoping to become big players in international markets after a sharp increase in production over recent years, with help from tax breaks, loans and other subsidies from Beijing. China overtook Japan as the world‚Äôs largest car exporter last year, while the Shenzhen-based manufacturer BYD last quarter surpassed Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla as the biggest-selling electric carmaker. The EU estimates China‚Äôs share of EVs sold in Europe has grown to 8% and could hit 15% by 2025, while AutoTrader expects one-sixth of the UK market to be controlled by Chinese firms by the end of the decade. Concern is growing among some senior backbench MPs over the future of the British car industry. Last year UK members of the inter-parliamentary alliance on China ‚Äì co-chaired by the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith and the Labour peer Helena Kennedy ‚Äì said the UK was ‚Äúsleep-walking‚Äù into a situation where carmakers could be ‚Äúundercut to the point of extinction‚Äù by Chinese companies. Sam Lowe, a trade policy expert at Flint Global and former member of the UK government‚Äôs strategic trade advisory group, said last week that he expected the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs this year. ‚ÄúWhile the UK government and industry are currently publicly reluctant to replicate the EU measures, this will probably change once China-originating cars originally destined for the EU turn up in observable quantities on British driveways,‚Äù he said. Griffiths warned there was a danger that an investigation into Chinese EVs could trigger retaliatory measures, highlighting that Beijing had launched an investigation into the alleged dumping of French brandy. ‚ÄúIf we were to do something in this space, the danger is that there is then a response from the country being investigated. And I think people are very aware of that,‚Äù he said. Labour and the Conservatives have expressed desire to grow domestic EV manufacturing capacity, with the government offering ¬£500m in subsidies to Tata, the Indian owner of Jaguar Land Rover, to build an electric car battery plant. However, the prospect of import protections are not universally popular in the EU, where German companies ‚Äì often with tie-ups with Chinese firms or significant sales in the country ‚Äì have expressed unease. Several carmakers in Britain have links with China, including JLR, which has a joint venture in the country. China has also acted as a big investor in the UK, including through the Chinese-owned battery company Envision AESC, which runs the UK‚Äôs only ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù in Sunderland, supplying Nissan, and Geely, which owns the black-cab maker London Electric Vehicle Company. Griffiths said the structure of the UK car industry could influence whether import restrictions would help or hinder British firms, while suggesting that cheap Chinese imports could benefit consumers and the push to net zero. ‚ÄúThis is essentially a consumer good that could be much cheaper, that could really accelerate the transition to net zero. So there are very important equities on both sides,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe obviously won‚Äôt take a view on this unless and until we‚Äôre asked to start a case. But I think it‚Äôs an interesting example where you see a number of different public policy goals coming into land within one investigation.‚Äù A government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúUK car manufacturers have not discussed their concerns with the TRA or requested an investigation into electric vehicle imports from China. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre firmly backing our auto industry with ¬£2bn of capital and R&D funding to 2030, Tata‚Äôs investment of over ¬£4bn to build a new gigafactory and Nissan‚Äôs ¬£2bn EV investment in Sunderland that will create jobs and opportunities across the country.‚Äù"

        "content": "The company behind Squishmallows, the squidgy pillows-with-a-face that count Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian among their fans, has filed a lawsuit against Build-A-Bear over claims it has produced a ‚Äúknock-off‚Äù to cash in on its success. Jazwares, which Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway acquired two years ago as Squishmallows became a global TikTok sensation, said that Build-A-Bear Workshop‚Äôs new Skoosherz toys look too similar to its own plush, huggable toy. Build-A-Bear, which launched the Skoosherz line last month in the run-up to Valentine‚Äôs Day, struck back immediately with its own legal action claiming that its ¬£18 cuddly pillow-like toys-with-faces are an extension of its existing animal range. The company argued that the Skoosherz line is only the most recent type of ‚Äúsoft, pillow-like squishie-type‚Äù toys that have been available for years. Build-A-Bear, which has filed its legal action in Missouri, wants a court declaration that it has not infringed Jazwares‚Äô ‚Äútrade dress‚Äù rights in Squishmallows, and that any such rights are unenforceable. Jazwares, of which Berkshire Hathaway took control in a $12bn deal for its parent company Alleghany in October 2022, has filed its intellectual property lawsuit in California. The company launched Squishmallows in 2017 and has vigorously defended its copyright since the toys became a global bestseller after going viral on TikTok. It called the Skoosherz toys ‚Äúknock-offs‚Äù. Jazwares said in its lawsuit that rival toys were similarly ‚Äúshaped fanciful renditions‚Äù of animals, with ‚Äúsimplified Asian-style kawaii faces‚Äù and ‚Äúvelvety velour-like‚Äù fabric. Kawaii means cute, tiny and lovable in Japanese. The new Skoosherz toy range includes a strawberry cow, rainbow sparkle teddy bear and red raptor. There was also a range of Squishmallows animals including a cat, frog and fox ‚Äì they also come as fruit, vegetable or a hybrid cross ‚Äì which became the must-have Christmas present in 2022. There are now more than 1,000 versions available. ‚ÄúBuild-A-Bear has gone to great lengths to copy the distinct look, feel and tactile design to capitalise on Squishmallows‚Äô global success blatantly and intentionally,‚Äù the company said. Jazwares has already launched a legal action against the Chinese online retailer Alibaba for allegedly selling counterfeits. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to intellectual property rights imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery,‚Äù said Moez Kaba, lawyer for Jazwares. Build-A-Bear Workshop was founded in 1997 by Maxine Clark, who was inspired to launch her own company after going on a shopping trip with a friend‚Äôs daughter. After being unable to find a Beanie Baby, the 10-year-old said they could make the toy at home.The first store was opened in St Louis, Missouri, and the business, which described itself as a ‚Äúteddy-bear themed retail-entertainment experience‚Äù, has expanded to more than 400 locations in 19 countries.The company, which has a market value of $322m, owns and operates about 350 stores with a further 68 franchised outlets operating internationally.Consumers have the option of customising their chosen furry animal as an activity in-store, or online, or can be bought without accessories. Build-A-Bear did not respond to a request for comment."

        "content": "Inflation was hotter than expected across the US last month as it continues to fall back from its highest levels in a generation. Price growth dropped to an annual rate of 3.1% in January, according to official data; above economists‚Äô expectations of 2.9%. In December, the consumer price index stood at 3.4%. The latest official data sparked a sell-off on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 falling 1.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1.1%. Stock markets have scaled record highs in recent weeks as investors grew more confident about the easing of inflation and some of the US‚Äôs largest companies released robust results.   Related: Joe Biden criticises snack makers for ‚Äòshrinkflation rip-off‚Äô   While inflation has fallen sharply since peaking above 9% in June 2022, many Americans are still feeling the pinch. Joe Biden, who is standing for re-election in November, must persuade them that the economy is working for them. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose by 0.3% in January, up from 0.2% the previous month and also higher than the 0.2% expected. The so-called ‚Äúcore‚Äù index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is closely watched as it tends to provide a better indication of inflation‚Äôs trajectory. It also increased on the month, from 0.3% to 0.4%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases the data each month, said the index was driven higher in January by the rising cost of shelter, including rent; motor vehicle insurance; and medical care. The US economy has remained robust in recent years, adding millions of jobs and defying predictions of recession even as the Federal Reserve has embarked upon an aggressive campaign to take on inflation. Employers added 353,000 jobs last month alone. Many Americans have not been feeling positive about the economy, as they grapple with their own financial realities. A closely watched survey by the University of Michigan indicated a rallying in consumer confidence last month, however, with sentiment jumping to its highest level since July 2021. Now that annual inflation is easing back towards 2%, Fed policymakers are preparing to cut interest rates for the first time in four years. Wall Street had been betting that the central bank would start doing so as soon as May, after the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, signaled that a cut was unlikely next month. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said January‚Äôs unexpectedly strong reading will reinforce the view in some quarters that the ‚Äúlast mile is the hardest‚Äù as inflation comes back down to earth. Prices in key categories like clothing and medical care commodities did fall last month, however. ‚ÄúThere is still plenty of disinflation in the economy,‚Äù Ashworth noted."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-13T13:24:01+00:00",
        "content": "Pay growth slowed less than expected in December, prompting predictions the Bank of England could start cutting interest rates later than previously expected. Earnings growth, excluding bonuses, fell only modestly to 6.2% in October to December 2023 from a revised 6.7% in the previous three months, as workers continued to bid up their wages amid skills shortages and a record number of people with long-term sickness. City traders, who had expected regular pay increases to drop more sharply to 6%, trimmed their forecasts of how much the Bank would cut rates this year. Policymakers at the Bank have signalled that pay rises will have to moderate before it cuts interest rates, otherwise rate cuts would risk allowing inflation to return later in the year. UK rate futures, which are used to gauge the likelihood of interest rate cuts, predict a reduction of just 0.69 percentage points this year, down from expectations last year that the central bank was poised to make cuts totalling 1.3 percentage points in 2024. George Buckley, the chief UK economist at Nomura, said a first cut in March or May, as financial markets previously expected, was now unlikely and that he was forecasting a delay until August.  Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures on Wednesday showed annual growth in regular pay rises including bonuses was 5.8% in October to December 2023. City traders had expected this figure would fall to 5.6%. After wages were adjusted for inflation, the ONS said workers enjoyed a sixth month of real wage increases. Total pay rose on the year by 1.6% above the consumer prices index and regular pay rose on the year by 1.9% in October to December 2023. The Bank‚Äôs decision on when to cut rates will be made more difficult by a fall in job vacancies for an 18th consecutive month and a slowdown in the growth of employment, which indicate the labour market weakened in the last months of 2023. A range of business surveys have shown annual pay rising in sectors with severe skills shortages. The jobs website Indeed said its employment tracker found that lower-paid categories such as childcare, cleaning and retail were among the most affected. It said many of these sectors were increasing pay before an increase of almost 10% in the national living wage due in April. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Indeed, said: ‚ÄúElevated pay pressures in this segment of the labour market don‚Äôt seem likely to abate soon.‚Äù City workers and staff in the business services sector, which includes accountants, marketing executives and lawyers, saw their average pay growth fall below 7% for the first time in almost two years. In a sign that pay growth will slow further this year, a pay survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that employers were pencilling in 4% in the private sector and 3% in the public sector for the year ahead. Meanwhile, job vacancies declined to 932,000 in the three months to January, the lowest since mid-2021. Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said there were further signs of labour market weakness in the trends of employment growth and sickness rates. ‚ÄúIt is clear that growth in employment has slowed over the last year. Over the same period the proportion of people neither working nor looking for work has risen, with historically high numbers of people saying they are long-term sick,‚Äù she said. The ONS said it estimated 2.8 million people between 16 and 64 were not in the workforce because of ill health, a higher number than previously thought. The Health Foundation thinktank said the situation appeared to be getting worse. ‚ÄúWith 688,000 more people out of the workforce since before the pandemic, 6.6% of 16- to 64-year-olds are now economically inactive for health reasons, a record high since 1993,‚Äù it said. Jake Finney, an economist at the business advisory firm PwC UK, said the consecutive falls in the vacancy rate showed the heat was being taken out of the labour market.   Related: UK workers must accept lower pay deals to help beat inflation, says Bank ratesetter   ‚ÄúHowever, the lingering concern for the Bank of England will be that the labour market has not cooled sufficiently to achieve a sustainable return to the 2% inflation target. This remains one of the key barriers to the base rate cut in May that markets are currently expecting,‚Äù he said. Jobs data has proved difficult to read since last autumn when the ONS suspended the labour force survey, which was used to measure key jobs market indicators such as employment and unemployment. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he welcomed the rise in real incomes and low unemployment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good news that real wages are on the up for the sixth month in a row and unemployment remains low, but the job isn‚Äôt done. Our tax cuts are part of a plan to get people back to work so we can grow the economy ‚Äì but we must stick with it.‚Äù The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the government‚Äôs efforts fell short of what was needed to reduce long-term sickness rates and raise wages in real terms to a level seen in 2008. ‚ÄúAverage pay is still worth ¬£12 a week less than before the financial crisis 16 years ago and more than a million people are on zero-hours contracts. The Conservative legacy is low pay, ill health and more job insecurity,‚Äù he added."

        "content": "Flight attendants are holding picket protests at over 30 major airports across the US on Tuesday as part of the Worldwide Flight Attendant Day of Action. Picket line events are planned in New York City, Orlando, Miami, San Francisco, Charlotte, Washington DC, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and several other major cities. Some 100,000 flight attendants across three different labor unions are expected to participate. The protests come as over two-thirds of flight attendants in the US, at United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Air Wisconsin, American Airlines, Omni and Frontier, are currently in new union contract negotiations. ‚ÄúLegacy sexism that traditionally devalued our jobs must be stamped out and replaced with the true value of our work,‚Äù the group said in a statement for the event. ‚ÄúOur time on the job must be compensated. We need retirement security. We need flexibility and control of our lives.‚Äù Over 26,000 flight attendants at American Airlines represented by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) voted to authorize a strike in August 2023 with 99.47% in favor. At Air Wisconsin, an American Eagle Carrier, flight attendants voted 99% in favor of a strike authorization and over 98% of flight attendants at Southwest Airlines voted in favor of a strike authorization last month. ‚ÄúWith the wages that we have, it‚Äôs just unsustainable. We can‚Äôt live off of these wages,‚Äù said Doris Millard, a flight attendant at Air Wisconsin for 44 years who said her pay had changed little since she started at the airline in 1980. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm being forced to give up my career and find something else or continue to basically live in poverty.‚Äù Flight attendants represented by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) at United Airlines filed for federal mediation in December 2023 and have held numerous picket protests amid long delays in their fight for a new union contract. ‚ÄúThe federal mediator requested by the AFA has scheduled our first negotiations session for March 19. We‚Äôre looking forward to working with AFA to narrow the issues so that we can continue to work toward an industry-leading agreement for our flight attendants,‚Äù said a United Airlines spokesperson in an email. Flight attendants at Alaska Airlines will be announcing their strike authorization vote results on Tuesday. Melissa Osborne has worked as a flight attendant for 23 years and has worked the past seven years at Alaska Airlines. She said union contracts had experienced cuts to wages and benefits since the 9/11 tragedy and the downturn experienced by the airlines industry. But she added working conditions have exponentially worsened since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, when workers had to deal with exposure to the virus, an uptick in unruly passengers and, more recently, issues with Boeing planes. ‚ÄúEven today putting on my uniform and going to work, there are several layers of anxiety all of us experience,‚Äù said Osborne. ‚ÄúI feel like that level of stress is not being recognized by the company, they‚Äôre not recognizing our value and what we do everyday.‚Äù She rejected claims from Alaska Airlines that the economic proposals from the union were not feasible. She said Alaska Airlines and others had come out of the Covid-19 pandemic with record profits and Alaska Airlines gave pilots pay raises outside of contract negotiations and recently reached a deal to acquire Hawaiian Airlines. Osborne said the picket protests were being conducted by flight attendants across different unions and airlines because they were all experiencing similar issues and fighting for similar industry improvements. The idea to organize picket protests across different airlines and unions, she said, came from Iceland where she attended a nationwide women‚Äôs strike in October 2023 across different jobs and industries. ‚ÄúLook at all of us, all fighting for contracts, all having the same sort of obstacles to overcome with our negotiations, dealing with the same company responses,‚Äù said Osborne. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be historic. It‚Äôs so impactful to tell companies we see what you‚Äôre doing and we‚Äôre going to stand together in solidarity. I‚Äôve been in the industry for 23 years and I‚Äôve never seen anything like this.‚Äù"

        "content": "Hydrogen is a beguiling substance: the lightest element. When it reacts with oxygen it produces only water and releases abundant energy. The invisible gas looks like a clean fuel of the future. Some of the world‚Äôs top automotive executives are hoping it will dethrone the battery as the technology of choice for zero-emissions driving.\nOur EV mythbusters series has looked at concerns ranging from car fires to battery mining, range anxiety to cost concerns and carbon footprints. Many critics of electric vehicles argue that we should not ditch petrol and diesel engines. This article asks: could hydrogen offer a third way and overtake the battery?\nThe claim\nMany of the strongest claims for hydrogen‚Äôs role in the automotive world come from chief executives at the heart of the industry. Japan‚Äôs Toyota is the most vocal proponent of hydrogen, and its chair, Akio Toyoda, last month said he believed the share of battery cars would peak at 30%, with hydrogen and internal combustion engines making up the rest. Toyota‚Äôs Mirai is one of the only hydrogen-powered cars that is widely available, alongside the Nexo SUV from South Korea‚Äôs Hyundai.\nOliver Zipse, the boss of the German manufacturer BMW, said last year: ‚ÄúHydrogen is the missing piece in the jigsaw when it comes to emission-free mobility.‚Äù BMW may be investing heavily in battery technology but the company has its BMW iX5 Hydrogen fuel cell car in testing ‚Äì albeit using Toyota fuel cells. Zipse said: ‚ÄúOne technology on its own will not be enough to enable climate-neutral mobility worldwide.‚Äù\nThe science\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but that does not mean it is easy to come by on Earth. Most pure hydrogen today is made by splitting carbon from methane, but that produces carbon emissions. Zero-emissions ‚Äúgreen hydrogen‚Äù comes from electrolysis: using clean electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.\n Interactive\n\nTo use hydrogen as a fuel it can be burned, or it can be used in a fuel cell: the hydrogen reacts with the oxygen from the air in the presence of a catalyst (often made from expensive platinum). That strips electrons that can run through an electric circuit, charging a battery that can power an electric motor.\nHydrogen offers refuelling in four minutes, higher payloads and longer range, according to Jean-Michel Billig, the chief technology officer for hydrogen fuel cell vehicle development at Stellantis. (The Mirai goes 400 miles on a fill-up.) Stellantis, which last month started production of hydrogen vans in France and Poland, is targeting businesses that want vehicles in constant use and do not want the downtime required for charging.\n‚ÄúThey need to be on the roads,‚Äù Billig said. ‚ÄúA taxi not running is losing money.‚Äù\n\n\nMany energy experts do not share the enthusiasm of the hydrogen carmakers\n\n\nStellantis thinks it can drive the sticker price down. Billig said that he expected by the ‚Äúend of this decade, hydrogen mobility or BEV will be equivalent from a cost perspective‚Äù ‚Äì although the company will make both.\nMany energy experts do not share the enthusiasm of the hydrogen carmakers. The Tesla boss Elon Musk describes the tech as ‚Äúfool sells‚Äù: why use green electricity to make hydrogen when you can use that same electricity to power the car?\nEvery transformation of energy involves wasted heat. That means that hydrogen fuels inevitably deliver less energy to the vehicle. (Those losses increase much further if the hydrogen is burned directly or used to make e-fuels that can replace petrol or diesel in a noisy, hot internal combustion engine.)\nDavid Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Cambridge, said: ‚ÄúIf you use green hydrogen it takes about three times more electricity to make the hydrogen to power a car than it does just to charge a battery.‚Äù\nThat could improve slightly but not enough to challenge batteries. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to do very much better,‚Äù Cebon said.\n Interactive\n\nMichael Liebreich, the chair of Liebreich Associates and the founder of the analyst firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance, created an influential ‚Äúhydrogen ladder‚Äù ‚Äì a league table ranking hydrogen uses on whether there are cheaper, easier or more likely options. He placed hydrogen for cars in ‚Äúthe row of doom‚Äù, with very little chance of even a niche market.\nCan hydrogen overtake batteries in cars? ‚ÄúThe answer is no,‚Äù said Liebreich, without a moment‚Äôs hesitation. Carmakers betting on a large share for hydrogen are ‚Äújust wrong‚Äù, and heading for an expensive disappointment, he added.\nThe key problem for hydrogen cars is not the fuel cell but actually getting the clean hydrogen where it is needed. The gas is highly flammable ‚Äì with all the safety concerns that entails ‚Äì must be stored under pressure and leaks easily. It also carries less energy per unit volume than fossil fuels, meaning it would require many times more tankers unless on-site electrolysers are used.\nInvestments are coming in hydrogen supplies, with heavy government subsidies in the US and Europe. But so far there has been a chicken-and-egg problem: buyers don‚Äôt want hydrogen cars because they can‚Äôt fill them, and there are no filling stations because there are no cars. Across Europe there are 178 hydrogen filling stations, half of which are in Germany, according to the European Hydrogen Observatory. Compare nine UK hydrogen stations with 8,300 petrol stations or 31,000 public charging locations (not counting plugs at homes).\nAny caveats?\nSo why does the International Energy Agency think that hydrogen will account for 16% of road transport in 2050 in its pathway to net zero? The answer lies mostly with bigger vehicles such as buses and lorries.\nLiebreich said he was convinced that batteries would still dominate energy supply for heavy goods vehicles ‚Äì to the point of co-founding a lorry charging company. ‚ÄúThere might be some hydrogen in HGVs but it will be the minority,‚Äù he said.\nEven Toyota acknowledges that hydrogen in cars has so far ‚Äúnot been successful‚Äù, mainly because of the lack of fuel supply, according to its technical chief, Hiroki Nakajima, speaking to Autocar in October. Lorries and long-distance buses offer a better hope for the technology, although it is also prototyping a hydrogen version of its Hilux pickup truck.\nThe verdict\nThe economics of hydrogen will change as governments‚Äô enthusiasms wax or wane. Other things could change: technology could improve (within limits) and make the gas more attractive, and prospectors may be able to find cheaper ‚Äúwhite hydrogen‚Äù drilled from the ground.\nYet for cars the die appears to be cast: batteries are already the post-petrol choice for almost every manufacturer. In the UK there have been fewer than 300 sales of hydrogen vehicles over 20 years, compared with 1m electric cars, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBatteries‚Äô domination is likely to be extended as the money pouring into research and infrastructure addresses questions of range and charging times. Compared with that flood of investment, hydrogen is a trickle.\nHydrogen‚Äôs advocates now face the question of whether they can build profitable businesses in longer-distance, heavy-duty road transport. They need an answer soon on where they will source enough green, cheap hydrogen ‚Äì and whether the gas would be better used elsewhere."

        "content": "When Anita Roddick sold The Body Shop in 2006, she left behind not just a thriving cosmetics and skincare empire but living proof that a business could follow strict ethical guidelines and still make healthy profits. But on Monday, the private equity-owned company filed the intention to appoint administrators. The process is likely to cause dozens of shop closures, putting jobs at risk and threatening a crucial source of sales for a global network of small farmers and producers. Such a fate seemed impossible when L‚ÄôOr√©al agreed to pay ¬£652m for the business, a deal in which Roddick ‚Äì along with husband and business partner, Gordon ‚Äì relinquished control only 18 months before her death. The decision to sell to a global corporation left many loyal customers stunned. Roddick had opened her first shop in Brighton in 1976, expanding rapidly through a franchise model and adhering to strict moral principles. In an industry dominated by lab-tested, synthetic products, shoppers flocked to a brand that did not just eschew corporate rapaciousness but actively campaigned against animal testing and for ethical relationships with suppliers. The defiant challenge to corporate and social norms made Roddick one of the most recognisable figures of the 1980s. Mark Constantine, a one-time supplier to The Body Shop who went on to found rival Lush, told the Guardian he had been ‚Äúinspired and terrified‚Äù by Roddick‚Äôs combination of iron principles with whip-smart business acumen. ‚ÄúShe did things that nobody else had the nerve and the balls to do. I don‚Äôt think B Corps [the ethical business standard] would exist without The Body Shop,‚Äù he said. To Constantine, not to mention customers and suppliers, the ethos of The Body Shop‚Äôs new owner, the French global corporation0 L‚ÄôOr√©al, was a world away from its roots. The Body Shop was one of the pioneers of cruelty-free cosmetics but L‚ÄôOr√©al had taken until 1989 to cease testing its products on animals. The then new owners also changed the business model, moving production to the Philippines and focusing on discounts to drive up sales. Nick Hoskyns has supplied The Body Shop with sesame oil from the Juan Francisco Paz Silva cooperative in Nicaragua for more than 25 years. He said L‚ÄôOr√©al did at least try to maintain the brand‚Äôs principles, having paid top dollar for them. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt say that it was ever the same,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was that radical activism that Anita and Gordon brought. Once it becomes more commercial, that changes.‚Äù For some years after the L‚ÄôOr√©al takeover, though, the brand and the business operation held firm. The scent and feel of famed products such as white musk and body butter ‚Äì continued to prove irresistible to ordinary customers and those in the beauty industry, such as the model Lily Cole. When the business was sold again, in 2017, it remained solidly profitable, with sales growing worldwide via a network of more than 3,000 stores. L‚ÄôOr√©al made a notional return on its investment, even factoring in inflation, extracting a fee of ¬£880m from the Brazilian buyer Natura. The S√£o Paulo-based firm specialised in ‚Äúdirect sales‚Äù, relying on distribution of its makeup and skincare products via independent sales representatives. It would go on to buy perhaps the best-known exponent of this model, Avon, in 2020. The Body Shop was a very different beast, with its costly high street stores and its high-quality ingredients sourced from a network of small producers. It began to buckle under the weight of changing economic conditions affecting the high street. Sales declined in the important US market, while inflation drove up costs and constrained customers‚Äô spending power. Natura‚Äôs efforts to pull the business out of its slump failed to bear fruit. Turnover in 2022 dropped from ¬£487m to ¬£408m, flipping a ¬£10m profit into a ¬£71m loss. By autumn last year, Natura was casting around for a buyer. The German private equity firm Aurelius stepped in, appearing to capitalise on Natura‚Äôs desperation by snapping up the business for ¬£207m, less than a quarter of what Natura paid six years earlier. If the deal looked too good to be true, one source familiar with the takeover said, that‚Äôs because it was. Natura‚Äôs eagerness for a quick sale might have meant a lower headline price tag but it also made for a much shorter than usual process of due diligence, the comprehensive process that companies considering a takeover use to kick the tyres before buying the car. Aurelius, which specialises in turning around failing businesses, ran the rule over The Body Shop for only five weeks. In that time, it failed to identify that it was dangerously low on working capital, the cash a business needs to fund day-to-day operations. Christmas and January sales failed to come to the rescue, proving lower than hoped. Whatever future The Body Shop has will be thrashed out under the oversight of an administrator, with the accounting firm FRP Advisory set to be appointed within days. The Body Shop employs more than 2,000 people in the UK, has more than 200 UK and Ireland shops, compared with about 100 at Lush and even fewer at L‚ÄôOccitane. Asked whether Lush would want to take on any of those sites, Constantine said that was unlikely. He expects The Body Shop‚Äôs store network to shrink by about half. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs horrific from the point of view of jobs,‚Äù he said. Hoskyns was en route from Nicaragua to Germany to a conference of other small fair trade suppliers, many of whom now face significant uncertainty as a big customer teeters on the brink. He thinks the company‚Äôs decline is a cautionary tale. ‚ÄúActivist fair trade companies aren‚Äôt safe in the hands of commercial people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope a solution can be found. Capitalism has to show it can come up with the goods.‚Äù"

When Anita Roddick sold The Body Shop in 2006, she left behind not just a thriving cosmetics and skincare empire but living proof that a business could follow strict ethical guidelines and still make healthy profits. But administration, when it comes, is likely to trigger dozens of shop closures, putting jobs at risk and threatening a crucial source of sales for a global network of small farmers and producers. Such a fate seemed impossible when L‚ÄôOr√©al agreed to pay ¬£652m for the business, a deal in which Roddick ‚Äì along with husband and business partner, Gordon ‚Äì relinquished control only 18 months before her death. The decision to sell to a global corporation left many loyal customers stunned. Roddick had opened her first shop in Brighton in 1976, expanding rapidly through a franchise model and adhering to strict moral principles. In an industry dominated by lab-tested, synthetic products, ethically minded shoppers flocked to a brand that did not just eschew corporate rapaciousness but actively campaigned against animal testing and for ethical relationships with suppliers. The defiant challenge to corporate and social norms made Roddick one of the most recognisable figures of the 1980s. Mark Constantine, a one-time supplier to The Body Shop who went on to found rival Lush, told the Guardian he had been ‚Äúinspired and terrified‚Äù by Roddick‚Äôs combination of iron principles with whip-smart business acumen.  ‚ÄúShe did things that nobody else had the nerve and the balls to do. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think B Corps [the ethical business standard] would exist without The Body Shop.‚Äù  More here.

The Dow Jones industrial average of major US stocks is down 17 points, or 0.05%, at 38,654. After hitting a succession of record highs in recent sessions, the S&P 500 index is up 15 points at 5,028. Traders may be lacking energy after the drama of the Super Bowl last night. But there‚Äôs also some anxiety ahead of the latest US inflation data, due tomorrow, which is expected to show a slowdown in price rises.     2.30pm GMT   The UK‚Äôs services trade has performed better than the goods trade, Goldman adds, which is ‚Äúconfounding expectations for a significant decline after Brexit‚Äù. They add:  Indeed, services exporters are far less likely to report additional costs resulting from Brexit. Services account for over 40% of the UK‚Äôs total trade volumes, more than in the other G7 economies, and so this provides an offset to lower goods trade volumes.      2.24pm GMT   This chart from Goldman‚Äôs anaysis shows how UK goods trade has been weaker than the G7 average since Brexit, as well as lagging the ‚ÄúDoppelg√§nger‚Äù they created to simulate a UK which stayed within the EU. But it‚Äôs hard to really see what‚Äôs going on, given the impact that Covid-19 and the Ukraine war have both had on global trade. Goldman agrees there are still ‚Äúseveral open questions‚Äù regarding the trade effects, adding:  While the UK‚Äôs goods exports to the EU have been weak, goods exports to the rest of the world have fared similarly poorly. However, this is not necessarily evidence against weakness in goods trade being driven by Brexit. As other studies have noted, the UK‚Äôs goods trade with the rest of the world may also have suffered from spillover effects related to changing supply chains.      1.33pm GMT   Goldman Sachs conclude their analysis by looking at how Brexit and its economic repercussions might evolve.  They say:  The UK is in the process of negotiating a number of non-EU trade deals. While new trade agreements could, in principle, help mitigate some of the long-term costs of Brexit, many of the post-Brexit agreements simply rolled over existing agreements and estimates suggest that the benefit from new trade deals is likely to be small. For example, the government estimates that a free trade arrangement with Australia would boost UK GDP by 0.08%. Moreover, the timeline for major new trade deals‚Äîincluding with the US and India‚Äîremains unclear. The direction of UK/EU trading relations is therefore likely to be quantitatively more important. While we see a number of areas for potential closer cooperation, the direction will depend importantly on the next government‚Äôs plans and priorities. Comments by Prime Minister Sunak suggest that major changes under a new Conservative government would be unlikely. Labour leader Starmer has pledged to use the 2025 review of the TCA to push for closer relations. Starmer has flagged the potential for incremental steps in a number of areas‚Äîincluding a veterinary agreement, plus closer ties in professional and financial services‚Äîbut ruled out rejoining the customs union, or the single market.      1.04pm GMT  UK economy suffering a \"significant long-run output cost of Brexit\", says Goldman Sachs  The UK economy has suffered a ‚Äúsignificant long-run output cost‚Äù from Brexit, new analysis from Goldman Sachs shows. Goldman have looked into the economic costs of Brexit, both structural and cyclical, and found that UK real GDP has fallen short of similar countries by about 5% since the 2016 referendum. To find this, they conducted a ‚ÄúDoppelg√§nger‚Äù analysis ‚Äì using statistical techniques to find the best combination of other countries that match the path of UK real GDP before the referendum and using this same combination to project what might have happened thereafter, had the UK remained in the EU. The problem with this Doppelg√§nger approach is that the UK economy may have been worse hit by the pandemic and the energy crisis than other countries. But still, Goldman say the UK has suffered from higher trade costs, lower business investment, and a fall in immigration from the EU. They say:  First, we show that UK goods trade has underperformed other advanced economies by around 15% since the referendum. Second, business investment has been weak since 2016, falling notably short of the pre-referendum trend. Third, immigration from the EU has dropped sharply but non-EU immigration has risen significantly, although the recent increase has been skewed towards students with lower participation rates.  Goldman adds that while overall immigration has been higher than expected ‚Äì it hit a record in 2022 ‚Äì there has been an increase in overseas students coming to study, rather than EU immigrants coming to work. They add:  Taken together, the evidence points to a significant long-run output cost of Brexit, broadly consistent with the range predicted by prior studies.

Diamondback Energy, the Texas-based independent oil and natural gas company, is buying rival Endeavor Energy Resources for $26bn of cash and share. Endeavor produces oil and gas from the Permian Basin, the largest US oil field, located in southeastern New Mexico and much of West Texas. Diamondback, which is worth $27bn, has fought off competition from other interest parties including ConocoPhillips. Endeavor was created by Texas oil engineer Autry Stephens, and is one of the largest private oil producers in the U.S., generating some 311,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. To lower his production costs, Stephens created and used his own fracking, construction, trucking and other services companies, Reuters explains (more here).     11.25am GMT  Biggest drop in average two-year fixed mortgage rate since 2022  The average two-year fixed mortgage rate available to UK borrowers has fallen at the fastest monthly rate since the end of 2022, new data shows. Moneyfacts reports that the average two-year fixed mortgage rate fell ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù in January, by 0.37%, its biggest monthly fall since December 2022. This lowered the average two-year fixed mortgate rate down to 5.56%, down from 5.93% at the start of January. Moneyfacts says:  Average mortgage rates on the overall two- and five-year fixed rate deals fell for a sixth consecutive month. The overall average two- and five-year fixed rates fell between the start of January and the start of February, to 5.56% and 5.18% respectively. The average two-year fixed rate stands 0.38% higher than the average five-year equivalent. The average ‚Äòrevert to‚Äô rate or Standard Variable Rate (SVR) fell slightly by 0.01%, to 8.17%. The average two-year tracker variable mortgage remained at 6.15%. Product choice overall fell month-on-month, for the first time since July 2023, to 5,787 options. The availability of deals at the 95% loan-to-value tier (274) has increased to the highest level since September 2022 (274). The average shelf-life of a mortgage product rose to 28 days, the highest figure since February 2023 (28 days).   Those still tracking or on SVRates see little change but overall Avg mortgage rates on 2 & 5y fixed rate deals fall for the 6th consecutive month to 5.56% & 5.18% respectively between Jan-Feb.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, said:  ‚ÄúBorrowers searching for a new mortgage deal may be delighted to know fixed mortgage rates continued their downward trend, with the average two-year fixed rate dropping by its biggest margin (0.37%) since December 2022. Those borrowers who have waited patiently in recent months to re-finance, or indeed are preparing for when their mortgage deal expires, would be wise to review rates, as lenders are closely monitoring the volatile swap rate market, which tends to influence fixed rate pricing. There have been big expectations for fixed rates to fall further, and whether now is the right time to refinance will come down to an individual‚Äôs circumstances. Lenders are in constant review of their ranges, and it is likely rates will fluctuate in the coming weeks due to the noises surrounding future rate expectations.

Given its positive reputation, and the strong demand for ethically sourced consumer products, The Body Shop will hopefully, after entering administration, be able to find a buyer for at least some elements of the business, like its most profitable stores or its online retail business.  Administration is an insolvency process which protects a company from legal action by its creditors while efforts are made to save either the company or, through a sale, the company‚Äôs business. However, it‚Äôs an unfortunate reality that a business in this situation can seldom avoid significant job losses and store closures.‚Äù      9.59am GMT  Analyst: Administration would be \"disappointing development\" for one-time trailblazer  If The Body Shop appoints administrators it will prompt fresh concerns about the health of the British high street, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. Administration will give its owner, Aurelius, the breathing space to restructure and close highly underperforming stores and refocus attention on e-commerce sales ‚Äì making it likely that some shops will shut for good. Streeter says:  While the plug will not be pulled on a brand that has lasted almost 50 years, it does still mark a disappointing development for what was a trailblazing venture. In the 1980s, the Body Shop was the place to go for young shoppers to splash out on fresh scented bubbles and beauty ranges, with a deep environmental conscience and a focus on social justice and conserving nature. But now stores like Lush hold the bigger pocket money draw for tweens and teens, lured in by fragrant bath bombs and innovative product ingredients. Rivals have stolen a march on what used to be the Body Shop‚Äôs unique eco-credentials.  The Body Shop‚Äôs sale to L‚ÄôOreal in 2006 was the start of a slow decline for the once unique bath and beauty store, Streeter adds:  Anita Roddick was a visionary, offering refills to cut down on plastic decades ago, but that policy was quietly shelved in the 90s to refocus on packaged gift baskets with refill stations only brought back a few years ago. It seems it was too little too late and the Body Shop brand has been struggling to stand out amid a crowded beauty market.      9.44am GMT  The Body Shop customers reminisce  The news that The Body Shop could soon appoint administrators has prompted a torrent of nostalgia from the company‚Äôs customers.

They add:  But there will be a focus on reducing its costs, including on property and rents, as well as building up its online presence. There are hopes it will be restructured to better compete with brands such as Lush, perhaps best-known for its bath bombs, which is popular with younger shoppers.  The Telegraph says The Body Shop‚Äôs trading in the UK was not as good as its new owners, Aurelius, had expected when they bought the retailer last November, adding:  The company‚Äôs most recent accounts show that The Body Shop posted a loss of ¬£60m in its last financial year, which came while the business was still owned by the Brazilian cosmetics group Natura & Co. The retailer said that it had been hit by a ‚Äúchallenging retail environment‚Äù, along with rising inflation and interest rates.  The Times says Aurelius hoped it could reverse the beauty retailer‚Äôs fortunes, however‚Ä¶  Retail sources said that after the deal had been completed at the start of this year, the new owner concluded that the company had insufficient working capital and was trading more weakly than it had anticipated. This week it emerged that Aurelius had sold parts of the beauty retailer‚Äôs Europe and Asia business.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is conducting a review of the axeing of tax-free shopping for tourists, which could potentially lead to the decision being reversed.   Related: Tax-free shopping for tourists in UK may return as government eyes rethink   Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says:  Heathrow has been enjoying strong passenger travel demand with January‚Äôs figures just shy of pre-covid levels, pointing to a significant recovery from the pandemic era doldrums. It also enjoyed a strong month in terms of cargo passing through the airport. While cost-of-living pressures continue to hurt consumers amid the backdrop of elevated prices and higher interest rates, it looks like individuals and families continue to prioritize travel over other luxuries where possible, even in the face of higher air fares. February will be the next major test for Heathrow as a gauge of demand over the typically busy half term period following the seasonal post-Christmas lull. Meanwhile Heathrow may enjoy a boost to airport spending if the Treasury U-turns on the axing of tax-free shopping for tourists. This has resulted in billions of pounds of lost sales and tax revenues for the UK economy and the public purse respectively so a reversal would no doubt be a welcome reprieve for the travel, luxury, and hospitality industries.‚Äù      8.17am GMT  Families need help saving more for rainy days  The cost of living squeeze has made it harder for retailers such as The Body Shop to grow sales. And new research today shows that one-in-three working age families have not managed to build up a basic ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù savings of at least ¬£1,000. This highlights how the poorest households are struggling to build up financial resilience amid the cost of living crisis.

Against a backdrop of the strong performance of the health and beauty sector over Q4 2023, it undoubtedly reflects a lack of innovation and far stronger competition than ever before with many health and beauty brands moving into the natural and socially conscious space which was once owned by Body Shop. It‚Äôs likely that the focus moving forward will be geared much more to online which will be better suited to what is now clearly a disparate customer base.‚Äù      7.50am GMT   Administration might allow The Body Shop to extract itself from markets where it is struggling. David Boynton, the former chief executive of The Body Shop, told Radio 5‚Äôs Wake Up To Money this morning that The Body Shop is a ‚Äúbig and complex international business‚Äù, operating in over 80 markets. Some are very successful and profitable, but others are less so, and in recent years the company didn‚Äôt have the money to either improve its loss-making markets or quit them. Boynton explains:  The fact is it‚Äôs very expensive to close markets, because of lease obligations and redundency costs, especially in countries like Germany and France. There are people speculating that the potential administation might be a means of removing some of the obligations in closing less profitable markets.

Thousands of jobs are at risk at The Body Shop, as the cosmetics retailer‚Äôs new owners line up administrators for its British arm. The Body Shop could go into administration as early as this week, leading to store closures, having suffered disappointing trading over Christmas and in early January. The retail chain, which has more than 200 shops, was bought by the pan-European private equity investor Aurelius last November. Administrators at FRP Advisory are likely to be appointed as soon as this week to handle an insolvency process, Sky News reported on Saturday, citing sources who said they expected the closure of a significant number of the stores. The Body Shop‚Äôs international businesses have already been sold to an unknown family office, according to Retail Week. The Body Shop, known for its ethical trading ethos, dates back almost 50 years, as my colleaue Rob Davies explains:  Roddick, an environmental campaigner, activist and entrepreneur, founded the Body Shop in Brighton in 1976. The company remained under her ownership for three decades, until she sold it in 2006. Roddick died the following year. By then, The Body Shop had become synonymous with its ethical positions, including a refusal to stock products tested on animals and a sourcing of ingredients from natural products that are traded ethically.

        "content": "The Body Shop was decades ahead of its time when environmental and human rights campaigner Anita Roddick founded it in a backstreet shop in Brighton in 1976. She demanded that all products be ethically sourced and cruelty-free, and customers were encouraged to bring their bottles back to the store to be refilled to reduce plastic waste. Roddick‚Äôs vision ‚Äì and products ‚Äì were a hit worldwide. She argued that ‚Äúbusinesses have the power to do good‚Äù and should ‚Äúexist to fight for a fairer, more beautiful world‚Äù ‚Äì as well as make money. Customers were mobilised in a series of campaigns to pressure governments, which led to changes to animal testing laws in 22 countries.  Within a few years the Body Shop brand was a household name and its products were proudly displayed in bathrooms in the UK and around the world. And, perhaps uniquely at that time, many were used by men as well as women.  As the Body Shop prepares to call in administrators, here are some of the products for which it became best known. White musk In the 1970s, musk scents were popular among hippy communities. Roddick brought the trend to the mainstream with the launch of the Body Shop‚Äôs white musk range in 1981. It quickly became ‚Äì the company claims and perhaps few disagree ‚Äì ‚Äúthe signature scent of a generation‚Äù. In case you were wondering what is actually in it, the blend includes ‚Äúclean aldehydes, jasmine absolute, lily of the valley and sensual musk‚Äù and it is designed to produce a ‚Äúclean and floral fragrance [that] awakens sensuality and confidence‚Äù. Body butter The Body Shop launched body butter in 1992 after Roddick learned that women in Ghana had been using shea butter to nourish dry skin for generations. Back home in West Sussex, Roddick experimented in her kitchen and the first of many types ‚Äì mango ‚Äì was born. The product was named by Roddick‚Äôs daughter Sam, who while preparing a slice of toast is reported to have said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like butter ‚Ä¶ for your body.‚Äù Dewberry oil The scent, described as being like warm summer berries, garden picnics and country cottages, was so popular that it sparked petitions when the Body Shop discontinued it. Online perfume outlets jumped to fill the gap, with one stating: ‚ÄúBody Shop discontinued Dewberry, they must be crazy! Our customers love it! Dewberry is our bestselling fragrance oil, because it‚Äôs so beautiful, and so hard to find these days!‚Äù Bath pearls A collection of 10 Body Shop bath pearls from the 1980s sold on eBay for ¬£25 before Christmas. The skin dissolved in water, releasing fragrant oils and transforming the bathing experience for millions. They were also discontinued but now ‚Äúthey‚Äôre back and cooler than ever‚Äù, according to TikTok, where videos of people using them are surprisingly popular. Loofah sponges The Body Shop is credited with popularising the use of loofahs and other plant sponges for exfoliating and cleansing skin. They come from the fruits of vine-growing luffa plants, which are part of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae) making them relatives of watermelons, cucumbers and pumpkins. When a luffa fruit dries out and is peeled, you are left with a fibrous interior that can be used as a sponge. You can follow this guide from the Natural History Museum to grow your own at home."

Retail giant Sainsbury‚Äôs told consumers there were problems that could affect the availability of black tea, although it is expected to be for a short period. A sign in one Sainsbury‚Äôs store stated: ‚ÄúWe are experiencing supply issues affecting the nationwide supply of black tea. We apologise for any inconvenience and hope to be back in full supply soon.‚Äù But retail bosses have said the problems are temporary and stressed that the impact on consumers is expected to be minimal.Sainsbury‚Äôs did not provide a comment. It is understood that the disruption is linked to Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, as well as supply and demand delays with one supermarket tea supplier. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: ‚ÄúThere is temporary disruption to some black tea lines, but the impact on consumers will be minimal as retailers are not expecting significant challenges.‚Äù   Related: No salt please, we‚Äôre British: how to make the perfect cup of tea   Other supermarkets contacted by the Guardian did not report issues. Waitrose said it was not experiencing any shortages. China, India, Sri Lanka and Kenya produce about three-quarters of tea globally. Freight shipments from Asia and east Africa have faced significant disruption over the past two months due to attacks in the Red Sea. Violence by Houthi rebels in the region caused most shipping firms using the vital trade route, which heads towards the Suez canal, to redirect shipments around the Cape of Good Hope at the foot of Africa. This adds roughly 10 to 14 days on to shipment times, as well as increased costs for shipping firms.Sparsh Agarwal, owner of several tea gardens in Darjeeling in India and founder of Dorje Teas, told the i newspaper in December that tea shipments were being stalled due to the disruption.‚ÄúWe sent shipments to the US and Europe two weeks ago, but they are still in Mumbai port and have not been picked up yet,‚Äù he said at the time.Joint strikes from the US and UK have been launched on the Yemen-based Houthis in recent weeks in a bid to stop the recent wave of attacks."

        "content": "Thames Water expects to leak more water than previously thought, after its ageing pipes were overwhelmed by a deluge of rainfall, it has emerged. Britain‚Äôs largest water company has told regulators it now expects to leak 585m litres a day this financial year, up from a previous forecast of 550m litres a day. In an update to its service commitment plan, a document required by the regulator Ofwat which provides information for customers, Thames pushed up its forecasts for the next financial year, too. It expects to leak between 512m litres a day and 530m litres, up from the 507m previously forecast. The revision will pile further pressure on debt-laden Thames Water to invest in its infrastructure, amid public and political anger over its sewage-dumping record. It comes as the government and regulators are attempting to clamp down harder on the water industry. At the weekend, it emerged that ministers plan to ban bonuses for water company bosses who fail to prevent illegal sewage spills. Meanwhile, Ofwat unveiled sanctions for water companies who provide poor service. The updated leakage figures from Thames Water, which serves 15 million customers across London and Thames Valley, show an improvement on the 2022-23 financial year, when it leaked 620m litres a day. The Guardian revealed last year that Sarah Bentley, Thames‚Äôs former chief executive who abruptly left, had told the government that hitting its leakage targets would be ‚Äúvery challenging to achieve‚Äù. At the time, Bentley blamed the hot, dry weather in 2022, followed by a wet winter, for exacerbating leaks from the network and from customers‚Äô homes. Thames Water said that since then, progress had been undermined by wet weather, including heavy flooding in January which overwhelmed its network. The heavy rains caused flooding in its sewers, even delaying the start of school term at Eton college because the toilets in its boarding houses backed up. Thames said the heavy rainfall, combined with a high water table, had put ‚Äúhuge pressure on our sewers and pumping stations‚Äù. The company has argued London‚Äôs corrosive soil and the age of its infrastructure ‚Äì with nearly half of the capital‚Äôs mains more than 100 years old ‚Äì is to blame for its leakage record. However, Thames has been criticised for under-investing in its infrastructure, including during the tenure of its former owners, a consortium led by Macquarie, which completed its exit from the business in 2017. The company is now labouring under a ¬£14bn debt mountain and last year its auditor warned it could run out of cash by April. Robbie Moore, the floods minister, said last week that the government and Ofwat were scrutinising Thames‚Äôs commitments on leaks, customer service and polluting Britain‚Äôs waterways. A Thames Water spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe have a refocused turnaround plan that aims to deliver for our customers and the environment and are prioritising in a number of areas including improving performance in leakage. ‚ÄúWhile we were making good progress during the first six months of 2023/24, we have been unable to mitigate the environmental impacts, essentially ‚Äòweather‚Äô, experienced during the autumn and winter which has meant that we will out-turn year four higher than our planned forecast. ‚ÄúAlongside this, the health of our assets has been declining over recent decades and is another cause of our current performance challenges.‚Äù The Environment Agency told Thames last year that it needed to do more to fix its leaking pipes before projects to take water from the River Thames or from Wales to tackle drought were considered. Its plans to tackle periods when water resources are tight include abstracting millions of litres a day from the Thames and replacing it with treated effluent, as well as taking 155m litres a day from Wales. The company is hiking average annual bills by ¬£15 to ¬£471 from April, and then a further ¬£175 to ¬£611 over the five years from 2025. Over the same period, it hopes to spend ¬£18.7bn, including ¬£4.7bn to improve service quality, and it plans to replace 54,000 lead pipes."

The 152-year-old company, which is based in Southwold in Suffolk, has instructed Alvarez & Marsal to ‚Äúexplore a range of options to fund the company‚Äôs future growth plans‚Äù. It said in a statement on Monday: ‚ÄúAs a business of more than 150 years, and ever mindful of the challenges faced by the hospitality and brewing industries in recent times, the company is continually proactive in seeking ways to ensure that the business is even more resilient for the years to come.‚Äù Shares in Adnams, which has seen its market value drop by almost two-thirds over the past year, fell nearly 5% after the news. Options are likely to include private capital from a high net worth investor or family office, as well as potentially the sale of some of Adnams‚Äô freehold assets from its estate of 45 managed inns and properties. In September, the company reported that operating losses in the first half of the year to June widened to ¬£2.4m, compared with an ¬£811,000 loss in the same period in 2022, as revenues remained flat at ¬£30m. The founding family remains the largest shareholder in the brewer, which has expanded into gin, beer and offering tours including of Southwold lighthouse. The hospitality industry continues to struggle to recover from the pandemic. Last year, the Yorkshire-based Black Sheep was bought out of administration by the investment firm Breal for around ¬£5m. Breal has since acquired a number of struggling firms, including the Warwickshire-based Purity Brewing Company, the owner of Session IPA, as well as south London‚Äôs Brick Brewery, and Brew by Numbers. The Leeds-based North Brewing Co also fell into administration last month but was saved by Steve Holt, the director of fellow Leeds brewery Kirkstall Brewery. The board of Adnams includes Steven Sharp, a former executive director at Marks & Spencer, and Simon Townsend, the former boss of the pub operator Ei Group. Others include Andy Wood, Jenny Hanlon, and Karen Hester. Adnams was formally established in 1890 but the company charts its roots to 1872, when George and Ernest Adnams bought the Sole Bay Brewery in Southwold."

        "content": "The UK government has said it is working on making sites available for new nuclear power stations, amid reported talks with the owner of the Wylfa facility in north Wales. Hitachi owns the site on the island of Anglesey or Ynys M√¥n, but its future has been uncertain since 2020, when the Japanese company formally abandoned its own effort to build a new reactor there after failing to agree financial support with the government. The government is in early-stage discussions with Hitachi to acquire the land, with the intention of finding a partner to develop a nuclear power station there. The government has in recent years committed to expanding nuclear power generation and launched Great British Nuclear, despite significant delays and enormous cost overruns on existing projects at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk. The government laid out plans in January for what it described as Britain‚Äôs biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years, building reactors capable of producing 24 gigawatts of power by 2050. That would meet a quarter of the UK‚Äôs energy demand while producing zero carbon emissions. Those plans will depend on moving forward nuclear projects on the relatively few sites deemed suitable for new reactors. The Wylfa site has been valued at ¬£200m, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the talks between Hitachi and GB Nuclear. Wylfa is home to the last of the UK‚Äôs Magnox nuclear reactors, which closed in 2015, meaning it is deemed a suitable site for a large reactor or a small modular reactor (SMR). The government hopes SMRs will make nuclear power stations easier and cheaper to build. Companies and institutions in the British nuclear industry said on Monday that they were launching a recruitment drive to ensure there were enough workers to sustain the government‚Äôs push. The campaign, Destination Nuclear, said the number of employees needed to double in size over the next 20 years to support the possible quadrupling of output. There are about 64,500 workers across the UK civil nuclear supply chain, plus thousands more in defence, according to the Nuclear Industry Association, a lobby group. It has support from the French state-owned energy company EDF, engineers such as Atkins, Jacobs and Laing O‚ÄôRourke, as well as companies involved in the UK‚Äôs nuclear weapons and submarines programmes including Babcock, Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ‚ÄúWe have ended the stop-start approach to nuclear and recently launched a roadmap setting out the biggest expansion of the sector in 70 years, simplifying regulation and shortening the process for building new power stations ‚Äì meaning cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy in the long-term. ‚ÄúWylfa is one of a number of potential sites that could host civil nuclear projects. While no decisions on sites have yet been taken, we are working with Great British Nuclear to support access to potential sites for new nuclear projects.‚Äù A Hitachi spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe own two of the premier locations for nuclear new-build in the UK and we will continue to speak with interested parties about the future for the sites.‚Äù"

        "content": "Two American oil and gas companies have said they will merge in a $26bn (¬£21bn) deal, the latest in a wave of acquisitions designed to buy up the best land for drilling. Diamondback Energy has agreed to buy Endeavor Energy Resources in a takeover that will create a company with a value of about $50bn (¬£40bn). The merger frenzy has been prompted in part by higher oil prices since Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago in early 2022. Companies are rushing to use their huge profits to increase output, despite analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that said new fossil fuel developments would push the world beyond the safe limits of global heating. The quickest way to increase output is to buy rivals with rights to proven reserves. The spate of acquisitions has included deals by US super majors. In October, Chevron agreed a $53bn (¬£42bn) deal to buy Hess, while ExxonMobil agreed to buy the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5bn (¬£47bn). Diamondback beat its bigger rival ConocoPhillips, which had also expressed interest in buying Endeavor, the Wall Street Journal reported. Smaller deals included Occidental Petroleum‚Äôs $12bn (¬£9.5bn) acquisition of CrownRock in December. That deal, and the takeover of Endeavor, are focused on extracting more oil and gas from the US‚Äôs vast Permian oilfield, which stretches across large parts of Texas and New Mexico. Endeavor was founded in 1979 as a single well in the Permian by Autry Stephens, who still chairs the company‚Äôs board. Endeavor now produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day. The deal values Endeavor at around $26bn. Endeavor shareholders will receive about 117m Diamondback shares plus $8bn (¬£6.3bn) cash, the companies announced on Monday. Endeavor shareholders will hold just under 40% of the new company. Travis Stice, chairman and chief executive of Diamondback, said: ‚ÄúThis is a combination of two strong, established companies merging to create a ‚Äòmust own‚Äô North American independent oil company.‚Äù He said Diamondback would ‚Äúhave industry-leading depth and quality that will be converted into cashflow with the industry‚Äôs lowest cost structure‚Äù."

The distinguished English scholar and encyclopedist Robert Burton claimed tobacco went ‚Äúfar beyond all other panaceas, potable gold, and philosopher‚Äôs stones, a sovereign remedy to all diseases‚Äù. Mark Twain, the eminent American wit, once proclaimed: ‚ÄúIf smoking is not allowed in heaven, I shall not go.‚Äù While tobacco smoking has itself fallen out of the cultural fashion ‚Äì a 2021 report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 11.5% of Americans over the age of 18 smoked cigarettes, compared with 20.9% in 2005 ‚Äì the plant‚Äôs active stimulant, nicotine, is enjoying a fresh vogue in a new form. And its enthusiasts are no less delicious in their raves, phrased in the hyper-enthusiastic parlance of our times: ‚ÄúI do have a Benja-Zyn ‚Ä¶ I gotta couple fuckin‚Äô Tempur-Pedic lip cushies, buddy ‚Ä¶ couple couch cushions for your upper deck, buddy.‚Äù * * * To anyone unschooled in the fratty, bro-y, vocal jazz of modern nicotine fandom, Zyn is basically a modern-day snuff, albeit sucked rather than snorted. It‚Äôs a brand of smokeless nicotine pouches produced by a Stockholm-based tobacco manufacturer, which was sold to the American multinational Philip Morris International (PMI) for $16bn in 2022. Zyn is sold in circular tins, containing 15-20 pouches, each of which contains anywhere from 1.5mg to 9mg of nicotine. (By comparison, the average cigarette contains anywhere between 8mg and 20mg of nicotine, of which only 1-2mg is actually absorbed through smoking.) ‚ÄúLip cushies‚Äù and ‚Äúcouch cushions‚Äù, meanwhile, are slang for the pouches themselves, which, with their rectangular profile, vaguely resemble cushions, or pillows. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs all kinds of slang for it,‚Äù says David Dobbs, a 21-year-old student living in California. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs videos on social media where people have fridges full of Zyn. And there‚Äôs different terminology, like you can use an upper-decker or a lower-decker,‚Äù depending where the pouch is placed in the mouth. For David, using Zyn (or ‚ÄúZynning‚Äù) is not an especially social ritual. He regards it as a smoking cessation aid. Barely in his 20s, he already considers himself an addict. He started smoking, and using nicotine vape products, when he was 16, and has since moved on to nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum and, currently, Zyn. ‚ÄúNicotine is definitely my drug of choice,‚Äù he admits. ‚ÄúI will find any reason ‚Äì any reason [to use it]. My brain is hyper-fixated. It is the thing.‚Äù *** This new class of tobacco-less nicotine pouches has some advantages over its predecessors. For one, Zyn and similar products do not require users to spit. This distinguishes them from other forms of smokeless tobacco, which, in polite company, necessitate the use of some sort of spittoon ‚Äì often an empty soda bottle or beer can. (Smokeless tobacco products are sometimes called ‚Äúspit tobacco‚Äù for this reason.) Not needing to spit makes this product much more discreet ‚Äì and, it follows, less revolting to those who may find spitting, or seeing people spit, just plain gross. For his part, David cites a range of reasons for preferring Zyn, from the relatively low price to the range of flavors. ‚ÄúIf I start talking about Zyns,‚Äù he laughs, ‚ÄúI sound like I‚Äôm a rep for them.‚Äù David‚Äôs hope that nicotine pouches can keep him off cigarettes is a view shared by PMI, which regards these products as part of its stated corporate vision to ‚Äúdeliver a smoke-free future‚Äù. (PMI was spun off from Philip Morris USA and its parent company, Altria Group, in 2008, in an apparent effort to focus on emerging international markets.) ‚ÄúThe objective is for us to replace cigarettes with products like Zyn,‚Äù says Corey Henry, a PMI spokesperson. ‚ÄúThe whole point of the product is for adults who want to switch away, particularly from traditional tobacco products.‚Äù Henry categorically denies that the company is actively engaged in funding any social media activity, or underwriting social media users (who self-identify, naturally, as Zynfluencers) who enthusiastically promote the product. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any kind of promotional relations or contracts with anyone doing this online,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe do get requests for partnership. We deny every single one of them.‚Äù Indeed ‚Äì beyond the potentially curious optics of underwriting the nicotine use, and abuse, of influencers whose relationship to the product straddles lines between the dis-regulated, ironized, and straight-up baffling, it doesn‚Äôt really seem like Zyn needs to buy publicity. While there are other brands of nicotine pouches ‚Äì including On! (owned byAltria), Rogue (whose parent company is the Florida-headquartered Swisher) and Lucy (produced by the LA-based Lucy Goods) ‚Äì Zyn is far and away the industry leader in category, commanding 67.3% of the market, according to a 2023 report. As proof its its ubiquity, ‚ÄúZyn‚Äù, ‚ÄúZyns‚Äù and ‚ÄúZynnies‚Äù have become synonymous with the category, much as ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù has become shorthand for ‚Äúsoda‚Äù or ‚ÄúKleenex‚Äù for ‚Äúfacial tissue‚Äù. Perhaps the fact that the monosyllabic word easily lends itself to puns like ‚ÄúZyn-babwe,‚Äù ‚ÄúZyn-aloa Cartel‚Äù and ‚ÄúZyn-dney Crosby‚Äù has lent further succor to the brand‚Äôs saturation. On TikTok, videos promoting ‚Äì or merely depicting ‚Äì Zyn use rack up massive engagement. A recent video of a woman preparing her boyfriend a ‚ÄúZyn birthday cake‚Äù, which is really just a tray of stacked Zyn tins, earned responses like: ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs slightly enabling but it‚Äôs hilarious ‚Ä¶‚Äù A December 2023 clip of the hirsute comedian Bert Kreischer trying Zyn has been viewed by nearly a million users. ‚ÄúEveryone who does Zyns seems like there [sic] either a salesman or shareholder in Zyn with the enthusiam [sic] they bring to try to get me to take one,‚Äù one commenter replied.   Related: ‚ÄòAll good to take to school?‚Äô: Australian influencers promote flavoured nicotine pouches to vape-addicted youths   Yet this popularity ‚Äì and the culture that has, spontaneously, emerged around it ‚Äì has raised some eyebrows. Recently, Chuck Schumer, the US Senate majority leader, called for a federal crackdown on Zyn, specifically, referring to the product as ‚Äúa pouch packed with problems‚Äù. He also claimed the company ‚Äúseem to lock their sights on young kids ‚Äì teenagers, and even lower‚Äù. Predictably, this led to a flamed-up culture war incident, which saw the controversial Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene calling for a ‚ÄúZynsurrection‚Äù. Conservative media quickly followed the trail. The commentator Michael Knowles, who once called the climate activist Greta Thunberg ‚Äúmentally ill‚Äù on Fox News and who has said that ‚Äútransgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely‚Äù, released a video stumping for Zyn. (Knowles is also the founder of a cigar company, Mayflower Cigars, and boasts on the company‚Äôs official website about smoking cigars as an underage boy, claiming that ‚Äúcigars are among the few things I‚Äôve loved longer than my wife, whom I first kissed at 16‚Äù.) The rightwing pundit Tucker Carlson is also a noted Zyn-thusiast who claimed nicotine can ‚Äúfree your mind‚Äù. Bob, an underage Zyn user who did not want to use his real name, said that he would not personally be opposed to government restrictions. ‚ÄúEven though I am a user,‚Äù he explains via email, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to a short ban until studies about safety can be conducted more thoroughly, but I doubt that will happen. I do think the government should prioritize safer forms of intake and market them as such, though.‚Äù * * * PMI‚Äôs spokespeople explicitly deny that Zyn, or any of their other nicotine products, are targeted to underage users. They maintain that the drugs are legally restricted to users aged 21-plus. But anyone who has attempted to procure nicotine or tobacco products while underage knows that, say, gas station or convenience store attendants working minimum wage are not necessarily superinvested in enforcing that law to the letter. Ben (not his real name), a 19-year-old Zyn user who lives in Missouri, admits that he only heard about the pouches a few months ago, thanks in part to media attention, social and otherwise. ‚ÄúThe smoke shop by me does not card for people who look college-age,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWith the Chuck Schumer thing ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think these companies have to market to teens and underage people. Word of mouth is usually enough, especially for something that is addictive, and also has a lot of brand loyalty, which also comes with any other tobacco product.‚Äù If there‚Äôs one thing Ben doesn‚Äôt seem to buy into, it‚Äôs the supposed physiological and neurological virtues of the drug, which have preoccupied users for as long as nicotine has circulated, from the commercial crops of 17th-century Virginia to the Parisian salons of the belle √©poque, to current-day online conservative media commentary. ‚ÄúPeople do like to talk about the cognitive benefits of nicotine,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think the fact that it‚Äôs so addictive kind of outweighs that. I‚Äôm not using it because I‚Äôm super-smart, or need to focus on classes. I‚Äôm using it because I‚Äôm addicted to nicotine.‚Äù"

        "content": "Joe Biden has criticised food companies for alleged ‚Äúshrinkflation‚Äù, making products smaller while keeping prices the same, in a video to mark the Super Bowl. The US president criticised big consumer brands for a shrinkflation ‚Äúrip-off‚Äù on Sunday night and said the ‚ÄúAmerican public is tired of being played for suckers‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúSome companies are trying to pull a fast one by shrinking the products little by little and hoping you won‚Äôt notice.‚Äù American football‚Äôs blue riband event attracts a huge audience in the world‚Äôs wealthiest country, and advertisers flock to market their products. Sunday‚Äôs game was won by the Kansas City Chiefs, who beat the San Francisco 49ers in a dramatic last-play comeback. Biden had declined to take part in a television interview, typically conducted with the president before the Super Bowl. However, the video would have made uncomfortable viewing for some of the world‚Äôs biggest food companies, including PepsiCo, Mondelƒìz and Unilever. The president did not name any products or companies directly, but the video, published on the official presidential X account, showed products including Gatorade drink, Breyers ice-cream, Tostitos and Doritos crisps, and Oreo cookies. Biden said: ‚ÄúSports drinks bottles are smaller, a bag of chips has fewer chips, but they‚Äôre still charging just as much. As an ice-cream lover, what makes me the most angry is that ice-cream cartons have actually shrunk in size.‚Äù PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Doritos and Tostitos, was approached for comment, as were the Oreo owner Mondelƒìz and the owner of Breyers, Unilever. US consumer price index inflation soared above 8% in 2022. That was in part, some economists believe, driven by several factors including monetary policy stimulus in response to the Covid pandemic, the huge rise in global energy prices as a result of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and heavy government spending pushed by Biden and other countries. Inflation dropped to 3.1% in December but some companies are thought to have responded to rising costs by marginally shrinking the size of products ‚Äì shrinkflation ‚Äì as well as changing recipes to reduce the amount of more expensive ingredients ‚Äì sometimes known as ‚Äúskimpflation‚Äù."

        "content": "Delivery drivers for food-ordering platforms including Deliveroo and Uber Eats are staging a Valentine‚Äôs Day strike to demand better pay and conditions. The stoppage on Wednesday is being organised by a grassroots group, Delivery Job UK, many of whose members are Brazilian. It claims to have more than 3,000 supporters in London and several other cities. The group hopes to draw attention to the low pay and insecure conditions faced by drivers, many of whom work on several delivery apps in parallel. App-based delivery drivers are generally classified as self-employed contractors, meaning their employers are not legally obliged to pay them the statutory ‚Äúnational living wage‚Äù of ¬£10.42 an hour, due to increase to ¬£11.44 in April. That status was confirmed by a supreme court ruling in November that found Deliveroo riders were not ‚Äúworkers‚Äù, after a long-running battle by the Independent Workers‚Äô Union of Great Britain for the right to unionise and bargain on their behalf. One of Delivery Job UK‚Äôs organisers, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said it was difficult to earn the national living wage ‚Äì even before costs are taken into account. The platforms tend to pay a flat-rate minimum a job, plus an additional fee based on distance; but these vary over time and drivers complain it is unclear how they are worked out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very random: we don‚Äôt know the algorithm, we don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs calculated,‚Äù said the organiser, who added that he hoped to encourage consumers ordering a takeaway to think about the conditions faced by drivers. Data from thousands of couriers collected by the app Rodeo, which allows them to compare their earnings across delivery companies, suggested fees were cut in 2022 and 2023, despite high inflation. Deliveroo is not included, as it has declined to allow drivers to make their details available. Dr Callum Cant, from Essex Business School at the University of Essex, who studies the sector, said: ‚ÄúThe single problem we have had with these apps over the last few years has been the continual reduction in real wages. So over time, things have got worse.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThese workers are so often treated as invisible. And they‚Äôre taken for granted.‚Äù Deliveroo has a voluntary agreement with the GMB trade union, which is meant to ensure they are paid at least the national living wage, plus costs, for the time they are on an order. A spokesperson for the company said: ‚ÄúDeliveroo aims to provide riders with the flexible work riders tell us they value, attractive earning opportunities and protections. ‚ÄúThousands of people apply to work with Deliveroo each month, rider retention rates are high and the overwhelming majority of riders tell us that they are satisfied working with us.‚Äù An Uber Eats spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe offer a flexible way for couriers to earn by using the app when and where they choose. We know that the vast majority of couriers are satisfied with their experience on the app.‚Äù Separately, more than 1,000 Amazon staff are expected to strike at the company‚Äôs Coventry warehouse from Tuesday to Thursday, amid a pay dispute."

        "content": "More than 11 million working-age people in Britain don‚Äôt have basic ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù savings of at least ¬£1,000, according to a report that warns that the poorest households are struggling to build up financial resilience amid the cost of living crisis. The Resolution Foundation said people across Britain faced a ‚Äútriple savings challenge‚Äù of insufficient savings, an inability to cope financially with major life events such as family breakdown, and inadequate retirement incomes. It said 11.2 million people lived in households that had savings of less than ¬£1,000, accounting for about one in three working-age households. As many as half lived in the poorest third of households in Britain. In a report with the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, the foundation estimated that the UK had a ¬£74bn shortfall of funds saved for emergencies and for retirement compared with a country in which every family had at least three months of income kept in precautionary savings. It said fewer than half of working-age households in the UK had savings worth at least three months of income, leaving them ill-equipped to face events such as unemployment or family breakdown. Highlighting the risk to households struggling with the cost of living crisis, it said those with lower levels of savings were more than twice as likely to use credit cards, overdrafts or borrowed money than those with more than ¬£1,000 held back. The thinktank urged the government to take action to encourage saving, calling for an expansion in auto-enrolment contributions by employers and workers to boost levels of financial resilience, suggesting a rise to 12%. Currently employers must enrol eligible workers into a pensions scheme with contributions of 8%. Employers must pay at least 3% and the employee the remaining 5%. The Resolution Foundation said employer and employee contributions should be matched at 6% each, with 2% of this amount contributed to an easy-access ‚Äúsidecar savings‚Äù scheme of up to ¬£1,000 to provide more readily available savings before retirement. Molly Broome, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ‚ÄúWe can address all three challenges by building on the success of pensions auto-enrolment to opt more people into both easy access and long-term saving. ‚ÄúWe should also offer people more flexibility over their pension pots, as other countries do, in order to help them with difficult circumstances. These reforms will improve families‚Äô financial resilience during their working lives and into retirement too.‚Äù A government spokesperson said auto-enrolment had helped almost 11 million people save for the future. ‚ÄúAnd to help those on the lowest incomes save, we offer targeted support including through our Help to Save Scheme, which offers a 50% bonus on monthly deposits of up to ¬£50 and saw use increase by over a quarter in the last year alone. ‚ÄúWe also encourage people to take advantage of the government‚Äôs midlife MOT offer, which helps them take stock of their finances and plan for retirement.‚Äù"

        "content": "A new scheme to fine water companies for providing poor service to customers has been dismissed as ‚Äúnothing less than a gimmick‚Äù ‚Äì as the money raised in fines will not go to consumers affected. On Monday, Ofwat unveiled sanctions for water companies that do not provide good communication and help to those who face problems such as having no running water. Throughout recent months, households across London, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent went without water following storms and cold weather. Critics have blamed ageing infrastructure for the burst pipes, which cause outages. Households complained that bottled water was not made available in good time, and that they were not provided with updates and information about the situation. The new rules on customer service could allow the regulator to impose fines of up to 10% of the company‚Äôs turnover. These fines go back to the Treasury rather than to reduce bills for consumers.   Related: Revealed: watchdogs and water bosses had dinner at private London club to discuss future   Ofwat pointed to recent figures, published in the annual water company performance report, which show that in 2022-23 there was a fall in customer satisfaction across most companies. This follows a decline in scores in 2021-22, and customer satisfaction is lower for all companies than it was in 2020-21. Announcing the charges, Ofwat acknowledged that customers face ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù and ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù when companies do not provide adequate communication and support when ‚Äúthings go wrong‚Äù. The Guardian recently revealed that Ofwat‚Äôs chief executive, Iain Coucher, has been having dinners in a expensive private members‚Äô club with water company bosses to discuss how to manage consumer anger about sewage spills and increased bills. The Liberal Democrats‚Äô environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt up to scratch and is nothing less than a gimmick.  ‚ÄúMoney should instead go right back in the pockets of the people affected, through compensation from the water firms. Why are people paying for a service they simply aren‚Äôt receiving? Conservative ministers need to get a grip on this and give people their money back when the taps don‚Äôt run and water firms mess up. ‚ÄúAll those who suffered endless water outages without compensation, especially Thames Water customers, will have their heads in their hands at this latest announcement. This is yet more macho talk from a regulator which is about as tough as a wet paper bag.‚Äù Ofwat and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs claimed that the fines would improve customer satisfaction. David Black, CEO of Ofwat, said: ‚ÄúFrom today we are putting water companies on notice to improve customer service and where we see failure, Ofwat can and will take action, which could result in significant fines. ‚ÄúOur new powers to issue fines for poor levels of service are part of a range of measures Ofwat has recently introduced including on environmental protection, company dividends and executive pay, to drive better performance and to hold water companies to account. ‚ÄúWe expect this new licence condition to deliver real improvements in customer service across the sector. It is in the companies‚Äô interests to put customers at the heart of their business and provide levels of service that increase customer satisfaction.‚Äù Steve Barclay, the environment secretary, said: ‚ÄúWe expect water companies to ensure customers are properly supported when services are disrupted. ‚ÄúEnforcement action for poor customer service is an important and necessary step to restoring trust in the water sector and has been made possible thanks to government giving Ofwat increased powers to modify the licences of companies in England under the Environment Act.‚Äù"

Administrators at FRP Advisory are likely to be appointed as soon as this week to handle an insolvency process, Sky News reported, citing sources who said they expected the closure of a significant number of the stores. The Body Shop‚Äôs international businesses have already been sold to an unknown family office, according to Retail Week. Roddick, an environmental campaigner, activist and entrepreneur, founded the Body Shop in Brighton in 1976. The company remained under her ownership for three decades, until she sold it in 2006. Roddick died the following year. By then, The Body Shop had become synonymous with its ethical positions, including a refusal to stock products tested on animals and a sourcing of ingredients from natural products that are traded ethically. Roddick‚Äôs decision to sell the business to the French corporation L‚ÄôOr√©al for ¬£652m attracted criticism from those who saw it as a departure from the company‚Äôs values.

        "content": "Bosses at Fujitsu have collected about ¬£37m in pay, bonuses and compensation for loss of office since the technology company won the contract to supply the software at the heart of the Post Office Horizon scandal, it has emerged. Accounts going back 25 years reveal the seven-figure sums paid out to executives of the UK division of the Japanese-owned technology company, even as more than 900 people were prosecuted as a result of flaws in the system their company supplied. Fujitsu, which is forecast to have earned ¬£1.5bn from the Horizon contract by the time of its expiry in 2025, has formally apologised for its role in the wrongful prosecution of Post Office owner-operators, known as sub-postmasters and postmistresses. The Tokyo-based company has also promised to contribute to compensation, although it has yet to say how much it expects to pay. However a report by the Treasury select committee, published this weekend, found that it won at least ¬£1.4bn of public sector contracts after a court had ruled that Horizon was riddled with ‚Äúbugs‚Äù. Analysis by the BBC, published on Sunday, has turned the spotlight on seven senior executives who presided over the contract. It found that they received ¬£26m in pay and bonuses during the life of the Horizon contract, as well as ¬£11m in compensation for loss of office. Alan Bates, the former post office operator who has become the face of the victims‚Äô campaign after an ITV drama centred on him, told the BBC that while bosses earned huge salaries, he and others like him were struggling to get by. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still the skint little people at the moment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just Fujitsu, it‚Äôs also the Post Office and senior executives who were on bonuses twice the size of their salaries and that‚Äôs for a state-owned corporation.‚Äù The executives named by the BBC are Keith Todd, who was in charge at Fujitsu at the genesis of the Horizon system in the late 1990s, and his successors Richard Christou, David Courtley and Roger Gilbert. They also include the current Fujitsu UK & Ireland boss, Paul Patterson, and his predecessor, Duncan Tait. The Guardian revealed last month that Tait, who told the ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells that the Horizon system was as safe as Fort Knox, was handed ¬£2.6m for loss of office after standing down in 2019. In December that year, a high court ruling determined that ‚Äúbugs, errors and defects‚Äù in Horizon could cause shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts, giving the appearance of theft or fraud by innocent post office operators. It emerged this weekend that Fujitsu won ¬£1.4bn in government contracts after that ruling from Treasury-linked bodies alone. The Treasury select committee found that the company held ¬£3.4bn of contracts with the Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, both before and after the 2019 ruling. Fujitsu has said it will no longer bid for public sector contracts unless asked to while a statutory inquiry in the scandal, led by Sir Wyn Williams, continues.  Christou, Courtley, Anwen Owen, Patterson and Todd declined to comment on their pay to the BBC. Gilbert said last week he was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù by the Post Office‚Äôs pursuit of post office operators. Tait said: ‚ÄúI am appalled by the harsh treatment of the sub-postmasters and postmistresses and want to do all I can to support the inquiry. ‚ÄúThis has been a terrible miscarriage of justice and, like others at Fujitsu, I am sorry for the damage that has been done to the sub-postmasters and postmistresses‚Äô lives and any role that Fujitsu played in that.‚Äù Fujitsu has repeatedly declined to comment on pay but said it ‚Äúregards this matter with the utmost seriousness and offers its deepest apologies to the sub-postmasters and their families. ‚ÄúBased on the findings of the inquiry, we will also be working with the UK government on the appropriate actions, including contribution to compensation. The Fujitsu group hopes for a swift resolution that ensures a just outcome for the victims.‚Äù"

        "content": "Retired firefighters who were responsible for tackling blazes on military bases have been unable to access their full pension due to ‚Äúnumerous‚Äù blunders by the outsourcing group Capita, it has emerged. Capita won a ¬£525m contract to run the Ministry of Defence‚Äôs fire and rescue service in 2019, renaming it the Defence Fire and Rescue Project (DFRP) after the privatisation. Since then, some retired workers from the service and spouses of deceased pensioners have complained that their benefits have been miscalculated, reducing their payments, while others have been left waiting up to eight months for money they were owed. The trade union Unite said problems with the scheme raised concerns about Capita‚Äôs upcoming contract to take on the administration of the entire civil service pension scheme, starting from 2025. The mistakes affect some retired members of a service that fights fires on military bases in the UK and overseas, using specialised equipment in particularly hazardous conditions, such as in proximity to ammunition or other military hardware. The DFRP scheme is not administered by Capita but by MyCSP, part of another outsourcing company called Equiniti. Capita admitted that it had supplied Equiniti with incorrect employment data about some of the scheme‚Äôs 700 members, an error that is understood to be at the root of delays and miscalculations affecting payouts. In a letter to the trade union Unite, seen by the Guardian, the Cabinet Office acknowledged that Capita ‚Äúmay not have provided the accurate data‚Äù, adding that it expects any issues to be fixed by July 2024. Members of the pension scheme told the Guardian that they were still owed hundreds of pounds or had waited months for any payment at all. Frank Gallacher paid into his pension pot for more than 40 years, and submitted his pension forms in November 2022, in time for his preferred retirement date of February 2023. The former worker at the Royal Navy‚Äôs Clyde Nuclear Submarine Base chased payment for four months and was eventually told that he would receive benefits from June 2023 but this did not happen until August, after multiple complaints by Unite. ‚ÄúThis was the most stressful episode of my life,‚Äù said Gallacher, who worked for the MoD fire and rescue service for five decades. ‚ÄúI can only assume the transfer from the MoD to Capita Fire Rescue for some reason made my pension disappear.‚Äù Sally Stringer said she had missed out on a higher rate associated with a promotion that her late husband had won. ‚ÄúThis only added to the trauma and loss I already felt,‚Äù she said. Unite said it believed ‚Äúnumerous‚Äù scheme members have been affected and that some may not have come forward. The union said the mistakes raised concerns about the Cabinet Office‚Äôs recent award of a 10-year contract to run the civil service pension scheme, which has 1.6 million members, to Capita. Unite‚Äôs general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: ‚ÄúIt beggars belief to think that Capita, a company that has been bungling the management of pensions for 700 hard working firefighters, has now been rewarded with a green light to take over running all the pensions in the civil service next year. ‚ÄúOnce again, this demonstrates what happens when outsourcing and cost-cutting are valued above people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù The Guardian understands that Capita has performed multiple internal audits to find out why it submitted incomplete employee data to MyCSP. However, the company insisted it was not to blame for all of the pension problems. ‚ÄúWe do not administer DFRP pensions, but we provide payroll data to the administrator, [MyCSP]‚Äù a Capita spokesperson said. ‚ÄúWe have worked with Unite to review and resubmit payroll data to the administrator to ensure they are able to make accurate payments. This review has not prevented pension payments being made.‚Äù MyCSP declined to comment. Capita is due to take over administration of the scheme from MyCSP in 2025 as part of its wider civil service pensions contract."

        "content": "All eyes at the Treasury this week will be on estimates of economic growth in the final three months of 2023. A contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter would spell embarrassment for the government and disaster for Rishi Sunak. The second of the prime minister‚Äôs five pledges was to have the economy growing by the end of the year. Instead, it is widely expected that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) assessment of fourth-quarter activity will show that the economy contracted by 0.1%, after also shrinking by 0.1% in the third quarter (revised from an estimate of no growth). That would mean the UK was in a recession during the second half of 2023, albeit a shallow one. An economy is considered to be in recession after two consecutive quarters of contraction. The shallowness of the downturn is unlikely to stop Labour from ramping up its criticism of the government‚Äôs economic prowess. While much of the damage dates from the Liz Truss premiership and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng‚Äôs kamikaze budget, Jeremy Hunt promised that his steady hand on the tiller would provide the stability needed for companies to begin investing again. Yet Thursday‚Äôs GDP figures are expected to show that UK manufacturing was in recession all year and business investment negative, undermining Hunt‚Äôs claims. Corporate insolvencies are rising, with construction, retail and hospitality the worst-affected sectors.   It remains touch and go whether the MPC will be able to reduce interest rates as soon as May, as we and most investors expect  Samuel Tombs, Pantheon    Nevertheless, Gabriella Willis, a UK economist at Santander, says Hunt can look forward to better times. Not only is it possible the recession may later be re-evaluated by the ONS, with contraction turning into growth, but 2024 generally is forecast to be a better year. ‚ÄúThe UK recession, if confirmed, looks set to be as short and shallow as they come. We see reasons to be a little more upbeat on 2024, with surveys for January suggesting 2024 started on a better footing, shrugging off the year-end lethargy,‚Äù she said. The Bank of England will be focusing on how fast pay is rising. Officials are concerned that labour market data due on Tuesday will show that despite the economic gloom, wages continued to rise in the dying months of 2023, which could mean inflation rising again later this year, limiting the scope for interest rate cuts. In a busy week for UK economic data, the ONS will also publish its inflation figures for January on Wednesday. Analysts say the signals are likely to be mixed, giving the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) a headache when it meets next month. Wages are expected to have increased between November and December by about 0.4%, which for a single month represents a strong boost to disposable incomes. The annual figure for the average wage rise could remain at 6.5% ‚Äì the same as it was in November, and well ahead of inflation. Catherine Mann, a former investment bank economist who started her career at the US Federal Reserve and is a member of the MPC, said in a recent speech that she feared companies were planning to put up prices this year even though their costs had fallen sharply. A few days after Mann‚Äôs speech, Sarah Breeden, a Bank insider who was promoted to the MPC last year, said she wanted to see wages growth falling before she would consider slicing back the cost of borrowing from its current level of 5.25%. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the labour market was weakening, but not at the pace needed for the central bank to cut interest rates imminently. ‚ÄúIt remains touch and go whether the MPC will be able to reduce [interest rates] as soon as May, as we and most investors expect,‚Äù he said. Inflation is proving a head-scratcher for all central banks after steep falls last autumn were reversed in the run-up to Christmas. Financial markets expect the UK consumer prices index (CPI) to rise again in January to 4.2%, from 4% in December and 3.9% in November. However, the recent increases are expected to be reversed during the spring, with CPI possibly falling below the Bank‚Äôs 2% target by June.  This prediction has encouraged financial markets to bet that a cut in the interest rate is coming sooner rather than later. Bank governor Andrew Bailey is worried that speculation about early interest rate cuts has already brought down mortgage rates and that an economic rebound, while modest, is in train. It means the path to much lower interest rates, whenever it begins, could be long and winding."

        "content": "Labour has a demographic ¬≠mountain to climb when it puts ¬≠forward plans to spend¬†only a few ¬≠billions of pounds, let¬†alone ¬£28bn. The parliamentary ¬≠constituencies the party must win from the Conservatives to secure an overall majority are overweight with older people who are resistant to change and want their government to watch the pennies. Touting a pledge worth ¬£18bn for green investments on top of ¬£10bn already earmarked was always going to be vulnerable, especially when there was scant debate about how people might be affected, ¬≠allowing speculation to escalate about its potentially deleterious effects. Does Keir Starmer favour ¬≠unfettered development when he says he will tear up the ¬≠planning rules? Would a pylon or wind ¬≠turbine appear near voters‚Äô homes to satisfy the need for extra electricity? The wealthy old want to hang on to a lifetime of gains, whether that is by maintaining the value of their home or by preventing their pension income from being taxed. In the 2019 election, age was a strong predictor of how ¬≠people voted. YouGov estimated the chance of someone voting Conservative increased by about nine points with every 10 years of¬†age. Ipsos Mori found that the Conservatives had a 47-point lead among voters aged 65 and above. Meanwhile, Labour had a 43-point lead among voters aged 18-24 and a 24-point lead among voters aged¬†25-34. Robert Ford, a professor of ¬≠political science at the University of Manchester, says Labour‚Äôs baby boomer problem can be ¬≠overplayed after a shift in attitudes to ¬≠infrastructure spending since 2019. Polling shows large majorities across all age groups when they are asked if they support government spending to repair and revive the UK‚Äôs infrastructure. ‚ÄúYou can see a crossover point in voting at age 60. So there is still a¬†difference of opinion between the workforce and retirees,‚Äù Ford says. ‚ÄúHowever, the public responds to conditions, and they can see that conditions ‚Äì the fabric of the nation ‚Äì have deteriorated. Surveys show the proportion of people in favour of extra spending is at a 20-year high.‚Äù   Reeves has scaled back her spending plans to a level that means they won‚Äôt need to be funded by higher personal taxes   Ford believes a bigger problem is how Labour continues to suffer from a general perception that it is not good with money. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the baggage Labour always struggles with,‚Äù he says. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has tried to convince every ¬≠audience she addresses of her ability to understand the economy with a run-through of her CV, beginning with the years spent as an economist at the Bank of England. Yet such is the pushback, ¬≠especially from newspapers ¬≠representing an older demographic, that Reeves has taken fright, scaling back her ¬≠spending plans to a level that means they won‚Äôt need to be funded by higher personal taxes. Instead, a tax on oil and gas ¬≠companies will pay for a programme of home insulation, while ‚Äútens of ¬≠billions of pounds of ¬≠private sector investment in green hydrogen, carbon capture, clean steel, renewable-ready ports and gigafactories will be unlocked through a new¬†national wealth fund that will¬†create half a¬†million good, well-paid jobs‚Äù.  Interactive  The wealth fund will also come without any call on taxpayers. Instead, the state will retain a share in the renewable assets in which it invests. In this way, the party hopes that the initial capital ¬≠provided by the government for these ¬≠projects will attract further private¬†investment. This switch to the state being a¬†facilitator rather than the driving force is common across much of the west, where age-related inequalities in wealth have been growing. Germany‚Äôs coalition ¬≠government, led by Olaf Scholz‚Äôs Social Democrats, were defeated last year in an attempt to switch unspent Covid emergency funds into green infrastructure projects. The ruling of the ¬≠constitutional court denied the government a¬†¬≠borrowing facility that would have ended a period of ¬≠austerity under Angela Merkel‚Äôs leadership that matched the UK‚Äôs ‚Äì and with similar damage inflicted on public¬†infrastructure. Scholz can only spend within strict debt rules, even though Germany has the lowest debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios of any¬†major economy in Europe, at 60%. The UK‚Äôs was 97.7% in December 2023.   Related: Public spending is not the only lever Labour can pull, says Starmer   Labour members and green groups ask why a carbon copy of Joe¬†Biden‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act cannot be inserted into Labour‚Äôs manifesto. The act ¬≠subsidises industries switching to low-carbon energy and works alongside, and overlaps with, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips and Science Act, which boosts the US semiconductor ¬≠industry, at a¬†total cost over 10 years of about $2tn (¬£1.57tn). The answer lies in the resources of the US government, which are far larger and more robust than the UK‚Äôs, and how Biden‚Äôs subsidies are directed at US firms. By contrast, the corporations ready to build giga-battery ¬≠factories for the car industry and electric-powered steelworks in the UK are all foreign-owned. Ford says translating a more enlightened public attitude into higher government spending needs younger people to vote. ‚ÄúThe brutal truth remains that as long as younger voters turn out at far lower rates than older voters, subsidising the old with the taxes of the young will be an electorally attractive proposition,‚Äù he says."

        "content": "The Japanese technology company Fujitsu, whose flawed technology for the Post Office led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of subpostmasters, is confirmed to have held contracts worth more than ¬£3.4bn linked to the Treasury since 2019. Figures published by the Commons‚Äô treasury committee show ¬£1.4bn of contracts were awarded to Treasury-affiliated organisations after a high court ruling in December 2019 over the company‚Äôs software. The judgment found that ‚Äúbugs, errors and defects‚Äù in Fujitsu‚Äôs Horizon system could cause shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts. More than ¬£2bn of contracts were awarded before the judgment. These contracts continued after the ruling, but some have since concluded. Fujitsu informed the Cabinet Office in January that it would not bid for UK public contracts pending the conclusion of the public inquiry into the Post Office scandal. The treasury committee last month wrote to organisations including HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England (BoE) to demand details of their agreements with Fujitsu. The committee found all three had held contracts with Fujitsu Services or its global-owned entities. HMRC awarded Fujitsu contracts worth more than ¬£2.8bn which were active during or after the high court ruling in 2019. It now holds about ¬£1.4bn of active contracts. The FCA agreed contracts of ¬£630m over the relevant period, but now only maintains agreements with the company or global-owned entities worth just over ¬£9m. The BoE only had one contract in the relevant period, worth more than ¬£417,000. It expired in August 2020. More than 700 subpostmasters were prosecuted after Fujitsu‚Äôs accounting software made it look as though money had gone missing from their shops. The technology failures led to one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in modern legal history. Harriett Baldwin, chair of the treasury committee, said: ‚ÄúWe have unearthed some information which, I believe, goes beyond what is known by the Cabinet Office. I hope this will aid transparency and scrutiny around the role of Fujitsu as a public sector supplier. ‚ÄúThe inquiry will run its course, and it is welcome news that Fujitsu have agreed to pay towards the compensation that wrongly convicted postmasters are receiving.‚Äù Scrutiny of the Post Office and Fujitsu has intensified since the broadcast of the ITV series last month of Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which prompted national outrage. The government has announced that innocent post office operators who were wrongfully convicted due to the Horizon scandal will have their names cleared under new laws which it says will overturn hundreds of convictions."

        "content": "Entrepreneurs are a false god. We offer them billions of pounds‚Äô worth of tax breaks and subsidies, and a lot of goodwill, when research suggests that most, after pocketing the cash, will do little to help UK plc prosper. Academic studies have found that small business owners, while being a significant slice of the economy and a source of employment, are very rarely the spur for innovation or increases in productivity, let alone the wellbeing of the workers under their employ (health and safety is worse in small businesses). If you want innovation and creativity, big companies with expertise to spare are a better bet ‚Äì or the kind of startups that thrive, like arm‚Äôs-length subsidiaries, shielded by the umbrella of a university or private equity firm. These are companies worthy of targeted state support. On the other hand, the idea of the entrepreneur as wealth generator par excellence is at best unproven and at worst entirely misplaced. It is important to pay attention to the academic literature, because entrepreneurship underpins the neoliberal narrative that has dominated politics for the past 40 years and still forms the bedrock of mainstream economic thought. Without any supporting empirical evidence, this belief has meant almost every entrepreneur getting a handout in the desperate hope that they might build a Microsoft or Amazon. At the start of 2023 there were 1.4m small businesses (those with 1 to 49 employees) and 36,900 medium-sized businesses in the UK (those with 50 to 249 employees). Last month, the National Audit Office (NAO) identified 39 reliefs aimed at increasing business investment. The bill for 29 ‚Äì most of them aimed at small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) ‚Äì was estimated at ¬£16.6bn. What bang did the government get for its buck? The NAO said: ‚ÄúThe Treasury and HMRC do not ¬≠monitor or evaluate reliefs closely enough to understand if they cost too much or achieve their intended economic impacts.‚Äù Entrepreneurs‚Äô relief costs about ¬£3bn a year, and aims to encourage people to start or join growing companies, by lowering the rate of capital gains tax they pay when selling the company. A review in 2019 by Adam Corlett at the Resolution Foundation came to a similar conclusion as the NAO: it is possible to see that 52,000 people claimed the relief in 2015-16, with an average gain of ¬£75,000 per person, but not whether their businesses were hi-tech startups or restaurant chains. Other tax reliefs for business are available, enterprise zones among them, where there is almost no understanding of the benefit of such colossally expensive state gifts. Paul Nightingale, a professor of strategy at Sussex University, says the UK is not alone. Most ¬≠governments have failed to provide a rigorous analysis of the impact that SMEs have on economic productivity and growth.   Politicians are hard-wired to believe that profound creativity only happens in the garden shed of a genius   Nightingale wrote a paper with Alex Coad, a professor at the Waseda Business School in Tokyo, that divided SMEs into ‚Äúgazelles‚Äù and ‚Äúmuppets‚Äù (marginal undersized poor performance enterprises). ‚ÄúMuppets‚Äù might seem harsh, but the former Bank of England economist, Andy Haldane, a member of the Treasury‚Äôs economic advisory council, was even less flattering when he called them ‚Äúzombies‚Äù. ‚ÄúDespite an almost universally accepted belief outside academia that entrepreneurial activity is a positive driving force in the economy, the accumulated evidence remains largely inconclusive,‚Äù the academics say. ‚ÄúA small proportion of high-performing firms drive the majority of innovation, wealth creation and new job generation, while most firms, including the median small business and the median startup, have only a marginal impact.‚Äù The economist most closely tied with the narrative that small firms can be creative, innovative and disruptive is Joseph Schumpeter, while the free-market evangelist Friedrich Hayek was credited by Ronald Reagan‚Äôs advisers and Margaret Thatcher as a touchstone. Coad says their positions are almost religious, in that they are faith-based rather than relying on evidence. Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, attacks the issue from a different angle. Her book on industrial policy, Public Purpose, shows most ‚Äúgazelles‚Äù are fostered by the state ‚Äì and not through indiscriminate subsidies, but consistent and persistent support from state agencies. Rather than weighing down a dynamic private sector, public investments have been behind many of the greatest innovations of our time, she argues. Yet politicians are hard-wired to believe profound creativity only happens in the garden shed of a genius entrepreneur. Now we must put up with Alan Sugar, star of the The Apprentice ‚Äì the 18th series of which is now showing on BBC One ‚Äì showcasing people we are told will enhance the UK‚Äôs economic potential. As a young entrepreneur, Lord Sugar created the Amstrad line of computers, built from pre-assembled components into machines that ultimately became a footnote in the history of IT. However, he made most of his fortune ‚Äì like so many British businesspeople ‚Äì from property. No doubt most of his proteges will go down the same route. In the budget next month, Jeremy Hunt will laud entrepreneurs, and Labour will do the same. Before they do, a bit of evidence for their cheerleading would be nice."

        "content": "With its colourful fruit and veg display and shelves filled with groceries it could be your local supermarket, but this is a play shop for adults and there is only one thing missing: plastic. Well, problem plastic. The mock store is the secret innovation lab of DS Smith, the FTSE 100 paper and packaging firm where major retailers and brands trek to see its big ideas to replace the plastic ready meal containers, fruit punnets and shrink-wrap consumers use every day. The centre, on a sprawling campus near Newmarket, in Suffolk, is a world away from the City. But making cardboard boxes is suddenly a sexy business after Mondi, DS Smith‚Äôs UK rival, this week revealed it is looking at buying it to create a ¬£10bn packaging supergroup. The potential consolidation comes at a critical time for the packaging industry. After enjoying a boom during the pandemic, when lockdowns led to a surge of parcel deliveries, it has faced falling demand as well as rising costs. At the same time, ahead of new recycling rules in England, companies need help to overhaul their packaging. While investment bankers work on a potential deal ‚Äì takeover talk has pushed DS Smith‚Äôs shares up 12% to value the company at ¬£4.3bn ‚Äì Wim Wouters, its innovation director, has loftier ambitions. He is focused on the long-term challenge of replacing plastic packaging with fibre. It might sound wacky but it is testing whether seaweed, daisies, hemp or even cocoa shells could be used instead of wood as the raw material. Wouters thinks one day the company will be able to create a transparent fibre-based film to rival the see-through plastic found everywhere today. ‚ÄúNot yet, but one day we will,‚Äù he says. The company set a five-year target to eliminate 1bn pieces of problem plastic from supermarket shelves by 2025 (it is at 762m and counting) and trumpets inventions such as the ‚Äúlift up‚Äù, a cardboard handle used instead of plastic to bundle multipacks of beer of soft drinks. Wouters describes the Lift Up as a ‚Äúgamechanger‚Äù, capable of withstanding high speed factory production lines. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking to major brands around the planet and as you can imagine, there‚Äôs a lot of interest.‚Äù The company, whose biggest customers include Tesco and Amazon, started with ‚Äúeasy‚Äù plastics to replace or simply remove before tackling the more difficult ones: fashioning containers capable of holding foods and liquids such as paint without going soggy. Its swaps include card punnets for fruit and veg and ‚Äúeasy bowl‚Äù (a cardboard tray coated with a thin layer of plastic) for ready meals or takeaways which cut plastic use by up to 85%. Another innovation is a box suitable for DIY materials such as paint and adhesives usually sold in sturdy plastic tubs. While cardboard paint pots might sound as useful as chocolate teapots, its paint-in-a-box is already on sale abroad. ‚ÄúOften plastic is very, very strong and that‚Äôs when it becomes an issue, because it lasts for ever,‚Äù says Wouters. ‚ÄúWhen we convert the plastic into a fibre it has to have the same properties.‚Äù The quandary he says is: ‚ÄúWe want them to be liquid-proof when we use them but when we recycle them, we want to be able to repulp them.‚Äù Lydia Butler, regional customer engagement manager at DS Smith, says using a mix of cardboard and plastic is still better than all plastic. ‚ÄúFor the moment the liner is plastic but in the future that could be a seaweed coating.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople think if it is made of cardboard it is going to get wet and soggy and actually that isn‚Äôt the case any more,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe can put plastic inside. We ship frozen fish all the way from Norway to the UK in boxes like this. They are wet on the outside and on the inside but they are fine.‚Äù The innovation lab also houses a mocked-up packing station, such as the ones Amazon workers use. That is because another focus is making the 167m online shopping parcels delivered to British homes each month greener, eliminating unnecessary plastic bags and bubble wrap, as well as half-empty boxes, a pet peeve for many Britons. Its solutions include Toblerone-shaped boxes, which are ideal for cylindrical items big and small, from deodorants to yoga mats and mops, and envelopes that pop open at the bottom to hold small items. Another is paper ‚Äúbubble wrap‚Äù cut with hexagonal cells that opens out to create a honeycomb-like protective layer. To pass muster, new packaging is put through tough tests including one that mimics being dropped down a flight of stairs. There are 50 different points when an online order can be damaged compared with seven when the same product is bought in a store, explains Butler. ‚ÄúIf you add too much paper you risk adding lots of packaging weight and when you add weight you add carbon in the supply chain,‚Äù says Butler of one of the factors it has to balance when substituting plastic. ‚ÄúYou need to make sure you are using as little material as possible, as well as making it recyclable, and those things go together.‚Äù At the moment, supermarkets and manufacturers, with the help of companies like DS Smith, are overhauling their packaging in preparation for the arrival of a much delayed new recycling regime in England designed to cut waste and move towards a circular economy. This is set against a recycling rate for England that has stalled over the last decade, with the most recent data showing it actually declined by 0.8 percentage points to 43.3% in the 12 months to the end of March 2023 (v the previous 12-months). This is below the 2020 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) target to recycle 50% of waste from households. The agency‚Äôs 2025 and 2030 targets of 55% and 65% also look in doubt. Indeed, at the end of last year MPs on the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) warned that despite all this brainstorming on packaging more plastic, not less, was at risk of being sent to landfill because of delays and uncertainty around the new rules. ‚ÄúThis means there is a real risk of insufficient facilities to deal with the increased volumes of recycling arising from the reforms, meaning packaging will be incinerated, sent to landfill, or exported for other countries to deal with,‚Äù the MPs said. By the time the government plan, billed as ‚Äúsimpler recycling‚Äù, was unveiled in October it had been somewhat overshadowed by events. The previous month Rishi Sunak bragged of having scrapped a proposal to ‚Äúforce you to have seven different bins in your home‚Äù even though such a move was not really on the cards. The key measures include a standardised list of items that councils must recycle and most households getting a weekly food waste collection by early 2026. A standardised recycling service (with other home nations expected to align with the legislation) is part of a three-pronged action plan. The other legs are the UK-wide extended producer responsibility (EPR) and deposit return schemes. When it finally starts (it has been postponed by a year to 2025) the EPR will transfer the costs involved in collecting and managing packaging waste from households from councils back to the producers. Firms will pay about ¬£1.2bn in annual fees to an administrator, who will ensure local authorities get payments to fund their services. Scotland devised its own deposit return scheme, but after a row over the inclusion of glass it has been delayed until the same year when a new service, covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is supposed to start. Lee Marshall, head of policy & external affairs at the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management said the recycling reforms were ‚Äúmoving in the right direction ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just unfortunate they‚Äôve come in two if not three years later than originally intended.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere does need to be capex investment and a lot of companies and councils have been waiting on the government to set out the rules,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to need to be an expansion of anaerobic digestion capacity to deal with all the extra food waste that‚Äôs going to be collected. We‚Äôre going to need more recycling sorting plants, but also refurbishments and upgrades of existing ones.‚Äù The investment required could be as much as ¬£10bn. This is the figure that needs to be ploughed into recycling infrastructure over the next decade to meet the 65% target, according to a 2023 report by the Environmental Services Association, the trade body for the resource and waste management industry. One company keen to be involved is the waste management firm Suez, which already has planning consent for two of the four anaerobic digestion plants it wants to build. John Scanlon, its chief executive, said it now knew what materials were to be collected from homes and businesses, but there were ‚Äúsome pretty big gaps‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very keen to invest,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe million dollar question is how much money local authorities will get to support the new services they need to put into place. We see 2024 as a really critical year.‚Äù Defra said that ‚Äúsignificant progress had been made on the delivery of its reforms to reduce waste and improve our use of resources‚Äù. ‚ÄúLast October we set out a new, simpler, common-sense approach to recycling, meaning that people across England will be able to recycle the same materials, alongside plans for consistent weekly food waste collections. We are working with the supply chain to strengthen relationships and ensure they are kept informed and involved.‚Äù"

        "content": "US stock markets hit another historic high on Friday, with the S&P 500 closing above 5,000 for the first time. The broad-based index of the largest and best-known listed companies has been driven higher by a series of reports underlining the US‚Äôs resilient economy and retreating inflation. On Friday the share index finished at 5,026.61: up 0.6% on the day, and 22% since a rally took hold in late October.   Related: S&P 500 hits new record high amid signs of easing US economic gloom   Consumer price growth was even lower than previously estimated in December, according to revised inflation data released on Friday. The US consumer price index rose 0.2% in December, rather than the previously reported 0.3%, the labor department‚Äôs Bureau of Labor Statistics said. With the rate of price rises now easing towards pre-pandemic levels, investors are preparing for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates for the first time in four years. Stocks have also been lifted by a robust earnings season, particularly among the US‚Äôs largest listed companies, and by a blockbuster jobs report last week. Breaching 5,000 is unlikely to slow the S&P 500‚Äôs rise, according to market analysts, who note that it only cleared 4,000 for the first time less than three years ago. ‚ÄúThere are times at which those round numbers matter a whole lot, but in this case, I don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Katie Stockton, managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a research firm, told CNBC. ‚ÄúWe still have such strong momentum behind the market.‚Äù The S&P 500 has had an extraordinary run since Joe Biden first won office in November 2020, when it stood at 3,369.16. It has since surged about 49% as pandemic restrictions were loosened, much of the world grappled with inflation, and two major conflicts broke out. While Donald Trump was in the White House he frequently touted the stock market as a measure of his administration‚Äôs economic success. As the pair prepare to face off in November, the former president has claimed ‚Äì without evidence ‚Äì that his electoral prospects are responsible for the recent rally. The market has risen because investors ‚Äúthink I‚Äôm going to be elected‚Äù, the former president told Fox News this month.

        "content": "The government‚Äôs anti-dumping body has recommended that measures limiting the import of certain steel products be lifted after the decision to close the blast furnaces at Port Talbot. The Trade Remedies Authority, which is charged with protecting UK industry from dumped or subsidised imports, said its preliminary view was to advise the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, to suspend safeguarding measures on imports of hot-rolled flat and coil steel for a temporary period of nine months. The decision came a month after Tata Steel revealed it was looking to shut the last two blast furnaces at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, which would result in more than 2,800 jobs being lost. After the decision, Tata and the UK steel importer Kromat applied to the TRA to consider suspending the safeguards. These put limits on the amount that can be imported to the UK tariff-free, with imports outside that quota incurring tariffs of 25%. The closure of the blast furnaces will severely deplete the volume of hot-rolled flat and coil steel that can be produced in the UK, meaning demand for imports could breach the quota.  The TRA chief executive, Oliver Griffiths, said: ‚ÄúThese reviews are designed to prepare the current steel trade regime for future changes in production at Port Talbot. ‚ÄúWe want to avoid a situation where new imports needed to backfill reduced domestic production pay tariffs of 25%, loading additional costs on to the UK economy.‚Äù The TRA suggested that, given Tata was the sole UK producer of these goods, it was unlikely that allowing more imports would create serious injury to UK producers. Tata has said it intends to build one greener electric arc furnace at the Port Talbot site but these will only be able to process recycled steel, and will take up to four years to build. The TRA said it was carrying out the reviews in parallel with the consultation between Tata and trade unions, and if a different production plan was agreed, it would take that into account in its recommendation to government. William Bain, the head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said: ‚ÄúThese reviews are sensible measures from the Trade Remedies Authority, which needs to take account of future altered domestic production patterns together with the needs of the wider economy on access to steel.‚Äù James Selka, the chief executive of the Manufacturing Technologies Association, said the move was positive if the UK didn‚Äôt intend to produce it in the future but that UK production was essential for future supply chain security. He said: ‚ÄúWe believe steel production in the UK is essential in supporting the government‚Äôs advanced manufacturing plan, which sets out to rebuild UK manufacturing after a decade of decline. ‚ÄúSteel manufacture is vital for supply chain resilience.‚Äù The TRA has also launched a review of the tariff-free quota for hot-rolled flat and coil steel in the future, which should conclude by the time the nine-month anti-dumping suspension ends and replace that measure.   Related: ‚ÄòDevastating‚Äô: Port Talbot steelworks to shut blast furnaces and shed up to 2,800 jobs   Hot-rolled flat and coiled steel is one of 15 categories of steel that have safeguarding measures in place but are due to end on 30 June. Chrysa Glystra, the trade and economics policy manager at UK Steel, said: ‚ÄúAny changes to the domestic supply of safeguard category one, hot-rolled coil, in the UK, are specific to this category and do not impact the overall need for safeguards in the UK. ‚ÄúAll the reasons why they were first introduced are still very much valid, namely the risk of trade diversion resulting from US section 232 tariffs and rising global steelmaking overcapacity.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 12 and 16 February 2024. Tata Steel has said that it intends to build one new electric arc furnace at its Port Talbot site, not four. And an earlier version said the TRA had recommended that the government extend safeguarding measures for 15 categories of steel for at least another two years; this was incorrect, and has been removed."

        "content": "The Port of Dover could become a target for criminals smuggling illegal and diseased meat into the country under new post-Brexit plans that will involve lorries from the continent being checked 22 miles inland, the port‚Äôs health authority has warned. The Dover Port Health Authority (DPHA) is now considering legal action against the government over its decision to end physical checks of imported meat at a post within the port. Instead, lorries will be directed to a new checking facility half an hour‚Äôs drive up the M20 at Sevington, Ashford. Lucy Manzano, the head of the authority, said that as a port with the only inland border control post in the country, Dover could become a hotspot for criminal gangs trying to bypass checks. She said: ‚ÄúThese goods will now come through Dover without interception at the port, with the anticipation and hope that drivers will self-present at a facility 22 miles away.  Interactive  ‚ÄúIt would be reasonable to assume that people involved in criminal activity ‚Äì and there‚Äôs lots of money to be made within food crime ‚Äì would start redirecting their stuff through Dover, because the controls won‚Äôt be in place.‚Äù The warning from the body, which is run by Dover district council, comes before the new post-Brexit border rules being brought in at the end of April, which will require most meat and dairy products to be physically checked at government border control posts (BCPs). At present, only spot checks are carried out by the DPHA on loads that come through the port. Currently, the DPHA is able to carry out spot checks on certain food products at the port to stop biosecurity threats such as meat carrying African swine fever from entering the country. In 2022, the authority seized 66 tonnes of illegal meat products as a result of these checks. Despite all other BCPs being positioned within ports, the government decided in November that physical checks of imports coming through Dover, the UK‚Äôs busiest port, will instead happen at its ¬£147m Sevington post in Ashford, Kent. This came despite initially indicating that the DPHA would carry out some checks within the Port of Dover itself, at its Bastion Point facility, which was only opened in spring 2022. Since then, the DPHA has been lobbying the government to reverse its decision but says that after ‚Äúvery poor communication in recent months‚Äù, it is now considering legal action. Manzano said it had engaged lawyers and was looking at the legality of having checks so far away from the border, and how this could weaken the country‚Äôs biosecurity. She said: ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre getting [from the government] is high level statements saying that biosecurity will be maintained, and enhanced, but without detail. ‚ÄúI understand through experience of seeing it on a daily basis [over 25 years], that this proposal cannot be delivered in a way that maintains biosecurity, and without undermining all of our import controls.‚Äù Last week, the environment, food and rural affairs committee wrote to the environment, minister Steve Barclay, warning the Sevington plan presented a ‚Äúpotentially serious biosecurity risk‚Äù and compromised compliance regarding lorries carrying goods. It wrote: ‚ÄúWe understand that drivers will be under no obligation to go to Sevington, if asked to do so. As such, we have real and reasonable concerns about the geographic dislocation of the inland border facility from the point of entry.‚Äù Manzano said most of the illegal meat it intercepted in 2022 came from the EU, and had travelled for days, often without being packaged or refrigerated properly, and in some cases came from regions with high risk of African swine fever, such as Romania. She warned that without checks at the port to pick these up some illegal loads could bypass Sevington and enter the supply and this would increase the risk of disease spreading by ‚Äúan order of magnitude‚Äù. A UK government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe have strict border controls in place to protect our high biosecurity standards ‚Äì and are confident that existing and new infrastructure will have the capacity and capability to maintain these standards. ‚ÄúWe recognise the strategic importance of the port of Dover and are continuing to work with the port authority on future support options.‚Äù The spokesperson declined to comment further due to potential legal proceedings."

The Bank of England should be able to cut interest rates ‚Äúfairly soon‚Äù, argues Franklin Templeton‚Äôs head of sustainability and European fixed income, David Zahn. Zahn told Reuters:  The UK economy has continued to disappoint, inflation is coming down quickly and the economy is more responsive to rate hikes, and rate cuts, than Europe or the U.S.‚Äù ‚ÄúTherefore the central bank should be able to cut rates fairly soon, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if they cut in the next 2-3 months.‚Äù  One of the Bank‚Äôs hawkish policymakers, Jonathan Haskel, has revealed that his vote to raise interest rates was ‚Äúfinely balanced‚Äù (he was outvoted). Haskel wants more proof that inflation pressures are easing, saying:  ‚ÄúThe signs that we‚Äôve seen thus far are encouraging. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen quite enough signs yet.  City traders now expect just three rate cuts in 2024, half as many as back in December.

China‚Äôs Shanghai Composite Index finished the Year of the Rabbit with a 12% loss, as shares were hit by worries over China‚Äôs economic slowdown, and the crisis in its property sector. Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng index had a worse year, losing almost 29% during the Year of the Rabbit. Chinese equities underperformed global stock markets in 2023, so shareholders will be hoping for a better 2024 ‚Äì especially if Beijing rolls out new stimulus measures to help the economy. Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at interactive investor, says:  While there are short-term challenges such as property and geopolitical risk ‚Äì the threat of conflict with Taiwan is a concern right now - improving fundamentals, strong consumer and technological advancements will be key drivers of the market. ‚ÄúAnd as China is increasingly recognised as being a major driver of global growth, investors should consider having exposure to China when building a balanced portfolio. China currently represents nearly 18% of world GDP but less than 3% of world market capitalization, having previously comprised over 5% in late 2020. ‚ÄúThe broad derating of Chinese companies over the past two years means that valuations look attractive, both when compared to historic averages and versus other world indices. Valuations are supported by strong MSIC China consensus earnings estimates of more than 14%. ‚ÄúFor these reasons, the recovery in Chinese equities should continue considering depressed/compelling valuations versus history and other developed markets combined with institutional holdings the lowest in five years, the risk/reward ratio for Chinese equities is favourable.   Updated at 4.05pm GMT    3.34pm GMT   The US stock market has hit a new record high today, as investors continue to hope for cuts in interest rates. A day after hitting the 5,000 point mark for the first time, the S&P 500 index has climbed by 0.25% to 5,010. The news that US consumer prices rose less than initially estimated in December (see earlier post) supported hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this year.     3.30pm GMT   Shares in pharmaceuticals group Moderna have dropped by over 5% today, which is being attribued to a study showing the efficacy of its experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine falls off over time.

US consumer prices rose by 0.2% in December instead of 0.3% as reported last month, the latest annual revisions of the CPI data show.

A judge has approved a scheme that will return ¬£230m to investors in the fund, after they ‚Äúvoted overwhelmingly‚Äù in support of the plan. The Financial Conduct Authority says:  We are pleased that the Court has decided to approve the scheme. We understand that LFS [Link Fund Solutions] expect to start making payments to scheme creditors as soon as possible, if there is no appeal of the Judge‚Äôs decision. Investors voted overwhelmingly in support of the scheme. The small minority have now had their representations fully considered by a judge, who did not agree with their arguments.  Some investors and law firms had argued that ¬£1bn should have been paid to Woodford investors. The FCA had previously ruled that the Fund‚Äôs administrator, Link Fund Solutions, had made ‚Äúcritical mistakes and errors‚Äù managing Woodford equity investment fund, particularly in ensuring it was able to easily repay customers who might want to withdraw their investments. Link was responsible for monitoring and supervising the investments executed by Woodford before the fund failed in October 2019, leaving hundreds of thousands of pensioners and small investors nursing big losses.

The GMB union said workers had voted to strike after rejecting a company offer relating to wage errors and health and safety concerns . Asda has said the majority of staff at the site will continue as normal.     10.44am GMT  Franklin Templeton's Zahn: BoE could cut rates fairly soon  Franklin Templeton‚Äôs head of sustainability and European fixed income, David Zahn, argues that the Bank of England should be able to cut interest rates in the next few months. Zahn told Reuters:  ‚ÄúThe UK economy has continued to disappoint, inflation is coming down quickly and the economy is more responsive to rate hikes, and rate cuts, than Europe or the U.S.‚Äù ‚ÄúTherefore the central bank should be able to cut rates fairly soon, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if they cut in the next 2-3 months.‚Äù  The money markets currently predict the first rate cut will come by June this year. The Bank has left interest rates on hold at 5.25% since last summer. As flagged at 10.36am, the markets now only expect three cuts this year ‚Äì not the six that were priced in at the end of 2023. That change has come amid a wider market repricing, after stronger-than-expected economic data out of America has undermined hopes that the US Federal Reserve would cut rates soon. As flagged in the intro, two Bank of England policymakers wanted to raise UK interest rates last week.  One, Jonathan Haskel, has said that he wants to see more signs that UK inflation is persistently falling to the Bank‚Äôs 2% target before changing his vote.  Updated at 11.39am GMT    10.36am GMT  Just three rate cuts expected in 2024  It‚Äôs notable that the City has dialled back its expectations for the number of UK interest rate cuts this year, even as the Bank of England has indicated that rates have peaked. The money markets now indicate UK rates will be cut three times this year, from 5.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024. At the end of last year, some analysts thought we‚Äôd see six quarter-point rate cuts, bringing Bank Rate down to 3.75%. Last week, the BoE said there had been ‚Äúgood news‚Äù on inflation, but it wants more confidence that price rises will slow.   Related: UK interest rates have peaked, the next move is down ‚Ä¶ but not yet   Last Friday, the City expected four cuts this year, bringing Bank Rate down to 4.25%. But the money markets have adjusted this week.   Updated at 11.58am GMT    10.06am GMT   Professor Costas Milas, of University of Liverpool‚Äôs management school, has analysed how geopolitical risks and oil prices have influenced UK monetary policy over the decades, through higher inflation and lower output. He tells us:  MPC member Haskel is (arguably) ‚Äòpartly‚Äô correct to wait until further evidence shows that inflation risks are waning.  My colleague, Mike Ellington and I assess just that. We look at the impact of geopolitical risks on the UK economy. We find that geopolitical risks and higher oil prices depress UK output and that oil prices lift UK inflation. So, there is a ‚Äòsubtle‚Äô tradeoff between higher inflation and lower output in making interest rate decisions. Crucially [see chart below], higher inflation raises public dissatisfaction with the BoE. However, the Bank‚Äôs policymakers ‚Äòhave not lost their nerve‚Äô. That is, public dissatisfaction does not sway the MPC‚Äôs decision on the level of interest rates which is really a positive:  Here‚Äôs the full blog: Do geopolitical risks influence UK monetary policy?     9.45am GMT   UK mortgage rates have inched a little higher today, data provider Moneyfacts reports. They say:  The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.59%. This is up from an average rate of 5.58% on the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.23%.

The Nikkei rose over the 37,000-point line for the first time in 34 years today, putting the all-time peak of 38,916 points set in December 1989 in sight.

In addition, the region has seen an influx of overseas investors who have chosen to flee Chinese markets in light of the country‚Äôs ongoing economic woes.  Unlike Western central banks, who have raised borrowing costs over the last two years, the BoJ still operates negative interest rates to spur demand. Yesterday, BOJ deputy governor Shinichi Uchida said it was hard to see Japan raising its policy rate continuously and rapidly even after negative interest rates end, which provided reassurance to markets. That pushed down the yen, which helps Japanese exporters. Earlier today, IMF deputy managing director Gita Gopinath said the BoJ should move slowly when it decides to start raising rates. That high in 1989 was followed by an almighty crash, as Japan‚Äôs absurdly high share and property price unwound.

It told the City this morning that reservations in January were higher than a year ago:  The reduction in mortgage interest rates throughout the first half has led to encouraging levels of customer enquiries in the traditionally quieter winter trading period, and an improvement in the private reservation rate during January to 0.59 per outlet per week (January 2023 - 0.45).  Bellway also reported a 28% drop in housing completions in the six months to the end of January, to 4,092 homes. This knocked its revenues down to ¬£1.25bn, from ¬£1.8bn a year earlier. The company says it is on track to build 7,500 homes this financial year (to the end of July), down from almost 11,000 in the 12 months to 31 July 2023, adding:  The economic outlook has improved through the period, although the Board is mindful of future risks to customer demand and cost inflation, particularly from ongoing geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, we will retain a clear focus on maintaining balance sheet resilience.      7.50am GMT   Rising energy prices risk complicating the Bank of England‚Äôs journey towards cutting interest rates. The price of Brent crude has climbed from $77.33 a barrel last Friday night to $81.50 this morning, in a week in which Israel rejected the terms of a ceasefire in Gaza proposed by Hamas, insisting victory was ‚Äúwithin reach‚Äù   Related: Netanyahu rejects Gaza ceasefire deal and says victory is ‚Äòwithin reach‚Äô       7.35am GMT   January‚Äôs UK inflation report, due next Wednesday, will influence how soon the Bank of England might start to cut interest rates. The annual consumer prices index is expected to have risen slightly last month, reports Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank‚Äôs chief UK economist:  After headline inflation surprised to the upside in December, we expect a further ‚Äì albeit marginal ‚Äì jump in inflationary pressure. Headline CPI in January will likely start the year at 4.1% y-o-y, lifted in large part by positive base effects. Core CPI, we think, will settle at 5.0% y-o-y ‚Äì dragged lower by core goods inflation. And we see services CPI inching higher to 6.6% y-o-y. For RPI, we see headline inflation staying put at 5.1% y-o-y. Risks to our forecast? Tilted to the upside. Indeed, weight changes for CPI will add another layer of complexity to our inflation projections. And given volatile moves in catering, travel, and package holidays in general, we could see services prices come in a little stronger than our baseline projections.      7.35am GMT   Jonathan Haskel also pointed out that the UK has suffered a series of shocks since he joined the BoE in 2018:  ‚ÄúI guess the second thing is ... it‚Äôs been a turbulent six years and a lot of ups and downs and Brexit, (the pandemic), Liz Truss and all that kind of thing. I‚Äôve got to say the economy, in some ways, has been amazingly resilient. ‚ÄúRelative to that magnitude of shocks, we‚Äôve navigated our way through all of this.‚Äù      7.32am GMT  Introduction: Bank of England's Haskel wants more evidence that inflation risks are waning  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A week on from leaving UK interest rates on hold, Bank of England policymakers have been scrambling to explain their votes, and hint what might make them change their mind. And this morning Jonathan Haskel, one of two Monetary Policy Committee members who voted to raise rates last week, has said he wants to seee more evidence that inflationary pressures are cooling. In an interview with Reuters, Haskel says:  ‚ÄúThe signs that we‚Äôve seen thus far are encouraging. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen quite enough signs yet. But if we accumulate more evidence on persistence, then by the very logic I‚Äôve just set out, I‚Äôd be happy to change my vote.‚Äù   \"The signs that we've seen thus far are encouraging. I don't think we've seen quite enough signs yet.‚Äù Exclusive: BoE's Haskel wants more evidence that inflation risks are waning before changing rates stance. @david_milliken @haskelecon https://t.co/0mQNQEkIEl‚Äî william schomberg (@BillReuters) February 9, 2024  Haskel revealed that his vote last week, to raise interest rates to 5.25%, was ‚Äúfinely balanced‚Äù ‚Äì perhaps a sign that he could soften his position, if inflation pressures softened first. But he insisted it was right to worry about inflation becoming embedded, telling Reuters:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to apologise for banging on about persistence because I think we‚Äôre right to.‚Äù  The BoE left rates on hold at 5.25% in a rare three-way split, with six policymakers voting for no change, and one ‚Äì Swati Dhingra ‚Äì pushing for a cut.   Related: Bank of England sticks with 5.25% interest rate but hints at coming cut   Haskel‚Äôs fellow hawk, Catherine Mann, revealed yesterday that her vote was ‚Äúfinely balanced‚Äù , but also cited risks of ‚Äúcontinued inflation momentum and embedded persistence‚Äù. Mann also warned that attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea could create an ‚Äúupward inflation shock‚Äù, driving up goods prices ‚Äì and meaning services inflation ‚Äì notoriously sticky ‚Äì would need to fall further before rates should fall. But high interest rates suppresses activity and slows the economy. Earlier this week, Dhingra argued that weak consumer spending and declining inflation means the Bank should have cut rates last week. The Bank forecast that inflation will drop to its 2% target this spring, down from 4% in December, but will rise again later this year. The City expects at least three interest rate cuts this year, bringing Bank rate down to 4.5% by the end of 2024.

Ken Murphy, Tesco‚Äôs chief executive, said: ‚ÄúTesco Bank is a strong business that has helped millions of loyal customers to manage their money for more than 25 years. As we look to the future, our aim is to be the best provider of financial services in the UK, with this strategic transaction and partnership with Barclays unlocking greater value for customers and for our business. ‚ÄúThe transaction will also significantly reduce our financial liabilities, in turn strengthening our balance sheet and allowing us to focus on continuing to grow our core retail business.‚Äù Tesco said the deal to sell the banking assets would remove ¬£7.7bn of ‚Äúcapital-intensive assets‚Äù and ¬£6.7bn of financial liabilities from its balance sheet. The retailer said the operating profit from its retained banking services, and the wider partnership with Barclays, was anticipated to be about ¬£80m to ¬£100m annually. About 2,800 Tesco Bank staff, including the senior management team, will transfer to Barclays as part of the deal. ‚ÄúThis partnership with Tesco is a further demonstration of the investment we continue to make in our UK consumer business,‚Äù said CS Venkatakrishnan, the chief executive of Barclays. ‚ÄúWe are looking forward to working closely with the team at Tesco over the coming months to enable a smooth transition and, subject to completion of the transaction, we look forward to welcoming Tesco Bank colleagues and customers to Barclays.‚Äù Last month Sainsbury‚Äôs Bank opened the door to fresh takeover offers after the supermarket said it would exit the banking business almost 27 years after its launch. The retailer is exploring a number of options for its bank ‚Äì which offers savings accounts, credit cards, travel money and insurance ‚Äì after a strategic review suggested it could be a distraction from a years-long overhaul, meant to bring the supermarket‚Äôs focus back to its core food and retail operations. The Co-op sold off its final 1% stake in its bank in 2017. Troubles at the mutual‚Äôs financial arm almost led to the collapse of the Co-op before the bank was bought out in 2013 by a hedge fund. Sainsbury‚Äôs and Tesco began offering insurance and other banking services as a way to gain further income from their regular clientele in the 1990s. Tesco bought out its banking partner in 2008 followed by Sainsbury‚Äôs in 2013 in order to gain more control over the operations with the idea that they could take on the major banks with superior customer service and a simple suite of products. Many other retailers now offer financial services via partnerships. M&S launched its bank in 2013 in partnership with HSBC, founded on an existing financial services business set up more than 20 years earlier, while Asda‚Äôs financial services arm runs via a series of partnerships offering loans, a credit card and insurance. John Lewis is attempting to build up its financial services arm, switching from a partnership on its credit card with HSBC to New Day in 2022, while it offers investment products with specialist Nutmeg, part of US lender JP Morgan. However, retailers have struggled to compete in a market dominated by large operators such as Barclays and NatWest from which account holders are reluctant to switch. New regulation and the need for expensive IT upgrades and specialist staff has also put a squeeze on profits."

        "content": "Former staff of a fast-fashion brand that boasts of empowering young women have told the Guardian they were subjected to a toxic culture of bullying, abusive and degrading comments. The claims about Missy Empire, a Manchester-based retailer now owned by Frasers Group, were made by female employees. The company was co-founded by the brothers Ash and Ish Siddique in 2015, and its website says it is ‚Äúfor the go-getters, the goal-setters, the kick-ass females who F with convention and create their own kind of pretty‚Äù. The brand logo is XX, which stands for ‚Äúthe female chromosome‚Äù, which the website says is ‚Äúa subliminal reminder that we are for the female and we will continue to empower you by the power of clothes‚Äù. However, 18 former staff who spoke to the Guardian described what they claimed was a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù working culture, where young women in particular were targeted for mistreatment by the managing director, Ash Siddique. They claim:  Staff were bullied, shouted and sworn at. He made degrading comments about models‚Äô body shape and physical appearance. Staff were asked to model clothes for the managing director. Seven members of staff said they were fired without reason, and two staff claimed they were unable to keep copies of their employment contracts. Missy Empire‚Äôs owners ignored formal complaints.  Their claims are supported by emails, screenshots and testimonies seen by the Guardian. The Guardian put all the claims to Ash Siddique but he failed to respond. Testimonies provided to the Guardian suggest Missy Empire‚Äôs junior ranks are staffed by predominantly young female workers, many in their first job, and that there is a very high rate of departures and dismissals. Attracted by a career in fashion, staff reported being excited to join only to have their enthusiasm and self-confidence destroyed. None of the workers who spoke to the Guardian stayed with the company for more than a year and a half; many stayed just a few months. ‚ÄúI was crying all day in the loos because I was bullied,‚Äù said one member of staff who started in late 2022 and left for a new job a year later. ‚ÄúDuring my first week there I was called into the office so many times and shouted at about mistakes and the business failing. He [Ash Siddique] made out like it was my fault.‚Äù She added that her experience there left her with ‚Äúanxiety and feeling depressed‚Äù. Bury-based JD Sports, valued at ¬£8bn, acquired a majority stake in Missy Empire in June 2021 and sold it to Frasers Group in December 2022. Both are FTSE 100 companies that own several smaller brands. Staff told the Guardian that JD Sports and Frasers Group were made aware of problems at Missy Empire, with at least seven emails detailing seven separate complaints sent to their human resources departments since April 2022. Some of the allegations made to the Guardian involved staff who left in recent months raising questions about what action had been taken. Frasers Group did not respond to a request for comment. A JD Group spokesperson said it was the majority shareholder for 18 months, but Missy Empire was ‚Äúresponsible for the day-to-day running of the business, including its own HR procedures‚Äù. ‚ÄòI was called a fucking idiot‚Äô Missy Empire staff raised complaints with Frasers Group in writing as recently as the end of last year. The entrepreneur Mike Ashley controls Frasers Group with a near-72% stake, having made his name with Sports Direct before taking over House of Fraser department stores and acquiring an array of retail brands including Missguided and Jack Wills. An email to the Frasers Group HR employee relations manager by one female worker, who left in the summer of 2023, raised issues of being sworn at in a conversation about holiday. She told the HR manager: ‚ÄúIn the conversation I was called a fucking idiot many times, mocked and told I‚Äôm not fucking needed, so I should feel free to walk out the door. Ash also said I am not allowed my holiday as he can decide when I do, and he doesn‚Äôt feel like giving me it, and if I would like to take holiday I can if I take it unpaid.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúMyself and the other employees are often spoken to in this manner. Ash‚Äôs behaviour while I have worked at Missy Empire has resulted in me having anxiety and feeling depressed.‚Äù In an earlier email, sent in March 2023, the same employee claimed what looked like a voice recorder had been spotted in the ceiling of the staff kitchen. She shared a photograph of it with Frasers Group and asked for it to be investigated. The staff member says no action was taken after either email, although the employee relations manager did respond on 20 March to say: ‚ÄúMissy Empire does not have a HR function at present.‚Äù They asked for further details after the complaint about fears of being recorded. ‚ÄòA toxic workplace where people feared for their jobs‚Äô At the start of 2023, another staff member, who worked at Missy Empire from summer 2022 but claims she was fired after Ash Siddique found a list she had been compiling of her grievances, also emailed the Frasers Group HR employee relations manager. She raised a series of issues, including allegations of swearing, and humiliating comments about staff members‚Äô performance and models‚Äô body shape. The worker claimed she had been subjected to this treatment and saw others being treated in the same way. The email claimed Ash Siddique ‚Äútreats staff like they are worth nothing; patronising, degrading. Swears consistently [sic] at you like you are dirt and belittles you until you submit‚Äù. It also stated: ‚Äú[Ash Siddique] comments on people‚Äôs bodies and looks and described a previous model as ‚Äòfat with the pig nose‚Äô.‚Äù It went on to say that the director created ‚Äúa toxic work environment where people feared for their jobs‚Äù. The woman, who was employed as a staff member in a creative role, said Ash Siddique asked a colleague ‚Äúwould she rather he said please or would she rather he paid her‚Äù. The employee alleges her complaint was not taken seriously.  Interactive  Staff allege the HR department email address at Missy Empire was controlled and monitored not by an HR manager but by Ash‚Äôs brother Ish Siddique, who is the co-founder and director, so they had nowhere to take their complaints to JD Sports or, since the takeover, to Frasers Group. A contract seen by the Guardian shows women were not paid for overtime. Lunch breaks were unpaid and they claim they had wages deducted if they were late back. Two female employees who felt they were dismissed without cause, and left in 2023, claimed they were in a meeting at the end of 2022 where women, when discussing pay rises, were told to join OnlyFans, a service used by sex workers to obtain payment for pornographic videos. ‚ÄúWe were just having a conversation about pay rises and he [Ash Siddique] said we should all be doing OnlyFans as a side hustle and he will be our agent,‚Äù a staff member claimed. Missy Empire‚Äôs creations include bodycon outfits, bikinis, crop tops and trousers at a lower price range. Its website says the designs ‚Äútake influence from celebs with sex appeal, current pop culture and the latest global trends‚Äù. One woman, in her 20s, who also felt she was dismissed without cause, said she was told in the job interview she would be one of many in her department but when she started this was not the case. ‚ÄúIn the first week, two people got fired and that was so normal to everyone working there. In the months I was there I saw lots of people leave,‚Äù she claimed. She claimed staff were asked to try on clothes to see how they fitted, despite this not being in their job description, and made to write down their measurements. ‚ÄúOne time a revealing garment came in too small and he [Ash Siddique] wanted me to try it on and I said no,‚Äù she said. A staff member who worked at Missy Empire for more than five months in 2022 described it as a ‚Äúbizarre place‚Äù to work. ‚ÄúThere was no privacy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAsh was very inappropriate with some members of staff.‚Äù She alleged that the director had ‚Äúraging arguments‚Äù in his office with suppliers and staff members. ‚ÄòHe only wanted women with big bums and big boobs‚Äô An employee who was there until spring 2023, and who claims she was fired without a good reason, said: ‚ÄúHe told us that models were too fat and we could not use them. He only wanted women with big bums and big boobs and a tiny waist.‚Äù Another former employee said the director would approve pictures of what influencers could be used to promote the brand. ‚ÄúHe was adamant that all the women had to have sex appeal ‚Ä¶ He would openly call women fat or skinny. He was very vocal.‚Äù Three workers have raised concerns about privacy because they allege they are not given a company phone and are expected to use WhatsApp on their phones and laptops to talk to colleagues. They claim the company‚Äôs managers had access to all laptops and so could read all their personal WhatsApp messages if they wanted. JD Group said as a ‚Äúsignificant shareholder‚Äù, Missy Empire colleagues could ‚Äúescalate any concerns through JD‚Äôs department or whistleblowing policy‚Äù. It said a ‚Äúsmall number of issues‚Äù were ‚Äúformally reported to the company‚Äù that were ‚Äúinvestigated and addressed‚Äù in line with its procedures. The spokesperson said: ‚ÄúEveryone has the fundamental right to feel safe and respected at work.‚Äù"

        "content": "PwC has faced furious rebuke from politicians, the country‚Äôs tax office and a regulator for repeatedly refusing to share a report it used to argue that a damaging tax leaks scandal was isolated to Australia. The report, by law firm Linklaters, was cited by PwC‚Äôs global executive to assure regulators there was no evidence that confidential details about multinational tax laws received by the firm‚Äôs international partners were used for commercial gain. The report was commissioned after a former PwC partner, who was advising the Australian government on the draft laws, shared confidential information with his colleagues over several years. That information was then sold to tech companies in the US, giving them time to prepare them for new, tougher laws. After being criticised by ‚Äúfurious‚Äù ministers and referred to the Australian federal police, PwC cited the report to assure regulators its global partners did not commercialise the government secrets. PwC‚Äôs global executive also said the report found six partners outside Australia should have raised questions about whether a colleague was providing them with government secrets.   Related: Crisis-hit consultancies among firms throwing money at Australian political parties   Australian senators and regulators want to know who those six partners are. The chair of a parliamentary inquiry into the scandal that saw PwC Australia divest its entire government consulting division for just $1, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, said the firm‚Äôs refusal to share the report was unacceptable.  Sign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Colbeck, who has previously sought the assistance of parliamentary oversight bodies in the US and the UK to obtain the report, said Australians deserved to know who ‚Äúthe dirty six‚Äù were and that the firm‚Äôs non-disclosure would be formally condemned by the Australian Senate. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt see the report, it ain‚Äôt going to be pretty,‚Äù Colbeck told the inquiry. ‚ÄúWe are deadly serious about this. Deadly serious.‚Äù PwC Australia‚Äôs chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, said he had repeatedly sought a copy of the report from the firm‚Äôs international executive but was denied on each occasion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve formally requested the Linklaters report again from PwC International Limited and that request was refused on the basis that the information contained in that report is privileged and confidential to PwC International Limited,‚Äù Burrowes told the inquiry, before apologising. Burrowes has been unable to tell the inquiry the names or locations of the international partners investigated by Linklaters. The Australian Tax Office (ATO), which has repeatedly expressed frustration about PwC Australia‚Äôs use of legal professional privilege claims to stymie its investigations, has not seen a copy of the report. An ATO deputy commissioner, Rebecca Saint, indicated the matter was being discussed with international partners. ‚ÄúThere is a great deal of interest in what has happened in Australia, internationally,‚Äù Saint told the inquiry. ‚ÄúThere is absolutely a lot of interest. We have certainly been working closely with others.‚Äù   Related: Big four consultancy firm partners could be banned from being on board of regulator after PwC scandal   The ATO‚Äôs second commissioner, Jeremy Hirschorn, said the firm was being obstructive. ‚ÄúWe share the frustrations of this committee that an organisation, which claims to be cooperative, is deliberately hiding behind the difference between their local firm and the international firm,‚Äù Hirschorn told the inquiry. The regulator that exposed the scandal, the Tax Practitioners Board, has repeatedly requested the document to inform its investigation of PwC Australia. The TPB has nine ongoing inquiries into the firm. ‚ÄúWe have asked for the report and the response we got was, ‚ÄòPwC Australia don‚Äôt have a copy of it and are not able to give it to us‚Äô. I would have appreciated a copy of it, quite clearly,‚Äù said the TPB‚Äôs chair, Peter de Clure. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock told the inquiry that PwC‚Äôs refusal to provide the report was ‚Äúa running sore of dishonesty‚Äù.  ‚ÄúPwC is disdaining the parliament, that is what you are doing,‚Äù Pocock said."

        "content": "Hein Schumacher, Unilever‚Äôs newish chief executive, was hired from a Dutch dairy co-operative, which isn‚Äôt always the first port of call when you‚Äôre looking for a get-tough boss to shock an international consumer goods titan out of its complacency, which was the rough brief to the headhunters once Nelson Peltz, feared US activist, had entered the Dove-to-Knorr boardroom. But the milkman is clearly out to make an impact. In act one last autumn, he opined that ‚Äúforce-fitting‚Äù worthy values on to brands can be an ‚Äúunwelcome distraction‚Äù, a view that hasn‚Äôt been heard from Unilever in a few decades. In Thursday‚Äôs act two, Schumacher said full-year numbers for 2023 that mildly cheered the stock market ‚Äì the shares rose 3% ‚Äì weren‚Äôt actually much good. ‚ÄúOur competitiveness remains disappointing and overall performance needs to improve,‚Äù he said. His specific beef was about the score for the percentage of the business that won market share ‚Äì a mere 37% when 50%-plus used to be common. That‚Äôs what happens, one might respond, when virtually your entire 7% increase in underlying revenues was achieved by increasing prices: some consumers will buy supermarkets‚Äô own-label goods instead. Unilever, like most of its peers, has received a lesson in the limits of its pricing power during a bout of commodity inflation. But it‚Äôs also hard to deny that Schumacher is correct in his diagnosis that Unilever can be run leaner and harder, just as many shareholders said two years ago when they rebelled against the abortive ¬£50bn bid for GlaxoSmithKline‚Äôs consumer products division. The group has a superb collection of well-invested brands with good market positions around the globe, but the sluggish share price since 2017 screams unfilled commercial potential. The open question is the speed at which it‚Äôs possible to turn the supertanker. Schumacher‚Äôs 10-point ‚Äúgrowth action plan‚Äù was long on yawn-inducing ‚Äústrategic cells‚Äù, ‚Äúcritical platforms‚Äù and ‚Äúend-to-end responsibilities‚Äù, but maybe one shouldn‚Äôt damn it for its jargon. Half the executive leadership has quietly changed in six months, which may give a clearer signal about the intention to deliver a kick to productivity. Other Unilever bosses have declared similar ambitions over the years, but Schumacher‚Äôs version looks genuinely different. It will either work or fail spectacularly, one suspects. In the meantime, if Schumacher really wants to demonstrate new corporate thinking, he and the new chair, Ian Meakins, should revisit the unfathomable decision to keep operating in Russia and keep paying corporate taxes to a Russian state waging war in Ukraine. Yes, we know you‚Äôve stopped advertising Magnum ice-creams and so on locally and fear the Kremlin would gain more by grabbing the factories. But the bottom line is that Russia, according to the accounts, still contributes 1% of group net profits of ‚Ç¨7.1bn ‚Äì so roughly ‚Ç¨70m, or ¬£60m, which isn‚Äôt small change. From a group that still says it wants to have ‚Äúa lasting positive impact on the world‚Äù, that remains impossible to justify. A new-broom chief executive with a mandate to make major changes would follow the lead of many other major firms and find a way out."

        "content": "A leading business lobby group has urged Jeremy Hunt to resist calls for large-scale tax cuts in his budget next month, saying the government needs to avoid ‚Äúshort-termism‚Äù and devote spending to projects that boost the economy. Adding its voice to a growing clamour for green investment, the Confederation of British Industry said pre-election giveaways at the budget should be kept to a minimum to allow for a surge in spending to achieve net zero. Speaking on Thursday at a conference in Westminster, the CBI boss, Rain Newton-Smith, said the government should increase spending on green targets from ¬£10bn a year to ¬£50bn a year by 2030. ‚ÄúThere is a need for growth that is sustainable, not fuelled by pre-election giveaways,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is predicated on a bedrock of stability. That focuses on the UK‚Äôs amazing capabilities and sets out a clear, long-term plan to make the most of them. Which we stick to. We can even call it an industrial strategy.‚Äù The Treasury is expected to have about ¬£20bn extra to spend over the next five years when Hunt delivers his second budget on 6 March. Economic growth is expected to improve in 2024 as inflation and interest rates fall and consumer and business confidence improve, lifting tax receipts and boosting the government‚Äôs finances. Hunt could use this ‚Äúheadroom‚Äù to reduce government debts, offer tax cuts or ease a planned austerity drive that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said would be ‚Äúmore painful‚Äù than during the decade of belt-tightening under George Osborne. Conservative backbenchers have lobbied strongly for Hunt to devote any spare funds to support tax cuts in order to close a 20-point polling gap with Labour, which on current trends is on course to win majority at the next general election. Cuts to inheritance tax, national insurance, income tax and stamp duty are among the pre-election giveaways Hunt has been urged by Conservative MPs and backers to consider. However, polling suggests there is little support for tax cuts paid for by inflicting further damage to public services. Last month, the International Monetary Fund said Hunt should focus on repairing the public finances in the wake of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine to free-up funds to meet growing spending pressures, including on health and the climate crisis. Hunt has refused to back higher investment spending, though he said the IMF was right to say ‚Äúuntargeted tax cuts that are just crowd pleasers‚Äù were not a good idea, in a thinly veiled reference to Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng‚Äôs disastrous mini-budget in September 2022, when unfunded tax cuts panicked financial markets and sent UK borrowing costs surging. In recent interviews with business leaders, the CBI found that one-third of firms believed their investment plans had foundered ‚Äúbecause of UK-specific factors‚Äù. It also found that 90% of UK-owned firms ‚Äúexpressed a negative view about the UK as a place to invest‚Äù. Newton-Smith said: ‚ÄúThere was a sense that without bold action, the UK‚Äôs competitiveness is slowing drifting away.‚Äù Keir Starmer has pledged to increase spending on green infrastructure, including investments in car battery plants, renewable energy and home insulation. However, he is expected to ditch a commitment to spend ¬£28bn by the end of the next parliament. Newton-Smith‚Äôs intervention comes as the CBI attempts to reassert itself as the voice of British business after a year of turmoil. The lobby group suffered an exodus of members after revelations about sexual misconduct were published in the Guardian last spring. Newton-Smith said: ‚ÄúAs one business leader told me, they don‚Äôt want to see tax cuts driven by short-termism, which leads to higher interest rates. They want stability so they can invest for the future. ‚ÄúTo fund our public services with an ageing population, we must keep large-scale tax cuts off the table. ‚ÄúWe must build resilience in our economy and society, while enabling us to play our part in mitigating climate change. And that takes investment ‚Äì both public and private. ‚ÄúAbove all, it must come from real investment in people‚Äôs skills and capabilities, in infrastructure and innovation. ‚ÄúIn other words, it can‚Äôt come from short-termism or tinkering around the edges.‚Äù"

        "content": "Weight-loss treatments need to become cheaper and easier to take and lead to less reduction in muscle mass, according to the chief executive of AstraZeneca, which is working with a Chinese company to develop a pill to tackle obesity and type 2 diabetes. In November, Britain‚Äôs biggest drugmaker struck an exclusive licence agreement with Shanghai-based Eccogene, for an experimental drug called ECC5004 that would also treat cardiometabolic conditions such as heart disease and stroke. Obesity and diabetes affect more than 1 billion people globally. Eccogene has conducted a four-week initial study involving healthy people and those with type 2 diabetes, and with AstraZeneca it is analysing the data. The two companies are planning intermediate trials this year in people who have the condition or are overweight. AstraZeneca is seeking to catch up with Denmark‚Äôs Novo Nordisk and the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, both of whom have experienced soaring demand for their weight loss and diabetes drugs. Novo Nordisk‚Äôs Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly‚Äôs Mounjaro and Zepbound are injected by users once a week and have helped some people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause unpleasant side-effects such as nausea. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca‚Äôs chief executive, said: ‚ÄúNovo and Eli Lilly are doing a great job. The next step is to improve the quality of weight loss to more fat loss and less muscle loss, and how do you make it cheaper.‚Äù He said the current drugs led to the loss of muscle mass as well as fat, and when people stopped taking them, they often regained weight quickly, gaining fat rather than rebuilding muscle. The challenge was to make weight loss ‚Äúmore durable and such that you lose more fat and less muscle‚Äù, Soriot said. By developing a pill that is taken once a day, AstraZeneca hopes to make it easier to use and accessible to ‚Äúmany people outside the western world‚Äù, as well as lower the cost. A pill would be far cheaper to produce than the injections, which come in pre-filled plastic pens. Wegovy‚Äôs NHS list price in the UK is ¬£73.25 for a month‚Äôs supply, while in the US, the list price for the same amount is $1,349.02 (¬£1070.50). Like the injectable treatments, the pill is a GLP-1 agonist, which mimics the action of a hormone that is naturally released by the stomach when people eat food. The drugs suppress appetite and slow the movement of food through the digestive system, so people feel full faster and for longer. AstraZeneca will also test the drug in combination with other medicines for a range of cardiometabolic diseases. Sharon Barr, who runs the drugmaker‚Äôs biopharmaceuticals research and development arm, said: ‚ÄúWe view this as a mechanism to promote general health and organ protection in interrelated cardio-vascular, renal and metabolic disease.‚Äù The company has two other injectable anti-obesity drugs in early-stage development."

        "content": "Dominic West‚Äôs portrayal of an arrogant, smoothie-drinking, branch-closing banker has landed Nationwide in potentially hot water, with the building society now facing a formal complaint over its TV advert from a rival lender. Santander UK is understood to have lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) over the television commercial, on the basis that it ‚Äúdiscredits and denigrates‚Äù Nationwide‚Äôs rivals and paints a misleading picture about bank branch closures. The ad in question shows West ‚Äì the actor known for playing parts including Jimmy McNulty in The Wire and Prince Charles in The Crown ‚Äì mock customers while laying plans for branch closures at his fictional bank. When a colleague challenges him, saying Nationwide are not closing branches, West replies: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not Nationwide, are we! We‚Äôre nothing like them. I went into one of our branches once,‚Äù he adds, before mocking a customer. ‚Äú‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to speak to the manager. I think I‚Äôve lost my life savings‚Äô ‚Äì total yawn fest!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if you have lost your life savings?‚Äù the colleague asks, before West says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what chatbots are for‚Äù, and snaps his fingers for a green smoothie. The swipe at high street banks that have been closing branches prompted rival Santander UK to file the complaint shortly after the TV advert aired in the autumn, according to Sky News, which first reported the story. An ASA spokesperson said the complaint was being reviewed, though it had not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received a complaint about this Nationwide ad. The complainant argues that the ad is misleading around other banks closing branches, and discredits and denigrates its competitors.‚Äù The television commercial was released in October last year, as part of a major advertising push by Nationwide, which had undergone a rebrand under the chief executive, Debbie Crosbie. The building society has been trying to set itself apart from rival banks and portray itself as a more ethical option, given it is owned by its members rather than shareholders. Nationwide has also been trumpeting its ‚Äúbranch promise‚Äù, having pledged to keep all of its existing branches open until at least 2026, unless there are circumstances ‚Äúoutside of our control.‚Äù Meanwhile, UK banks closed 645 branches in 2023, according to Which? magazine. They include Barclays, which shut 180 sites, as well as NatWest and HSBC, which closed 138 and 114 branches, respectively. Most lenders have been shutting branches to cut costs, saying it reflects the fact that more of their customers are banking online, particularly in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. Santander UK declined to comment.  A Nationwide spokesperson said:  ‚ÄúWe are aware of the complaint made to the ASA and await the outcome. Unlike the big banks, Nationwide has not pursued a significant branch closure programme. We now have more branches than any other brand and will soon be the last one standing in almost 100 communities. Our Branch Promise means that everywhere we have a branch, we‚Äôll still be there until at least 2026.‚Äù"

        "content": "Shares in Arm have soared by more than 50% after raising profit and revenue forecasts amid red-hot demand for artificial intelligence technology, valuing the UK-based tech company at double the market capitalisation when it floated in September. Shares in the world‚Äôs biggest supplier of design elements for processing chips used in products from smartphones to games consoles opened up 58% on the Nasdaq in the US on Thursday. Within hours an investor frenzy pushed Arm‚Äôs share price over $122, valuing the business at about $120bn. That is more than double the $51 a share offered when the Cambridge-headquartered business‚Äôs parent company, Japan‚Äôs SoftBank, floated the business in New York last September, snubbing the UK.  Rene Haas, Arm‚Äôs chief executive, said on Wednesday that the company was benefiting from the ‚Äúprofound opportunity‚Äù brought by the demand from tech firms to release products and apps underpinned by AI. Arm ‚Äì still controlled by SoftBank, which owns 90% of its shares ‚Äì beat analyst expectations to report revenues up 14% year on year to $824m in the final calendar quarter. Increasing demand from companies wanting to license its designs to run AI, and a recovery in sales of smartphones, prompted Arm to raise its full-year revenue and profit guidance. Arm‚Äôs first quarterly report, published in November, was much less well received by investors after the company revealed a $500m payout in remuneration costs after the New York listing, which required it to settle outstanding shares previously granted to employees. SoftBank‚Äôs decision to list in the US, despite intense lobbying by the UK government, dealt a blow to Rishi Sunak‚Äôs ambitions to make London the first choice for tech company flotations. Arm previously had a dual listing on both sides of the Atlantic before it was acquired by SoftBank for ¬£24.6bn in 2016 and had been a member of the FTSE for 18 years. The chip designer, which promised to keep its headquarters, operations and ‚Äúmaterial intellectual property‚Äù in the UK, indicated it would consider a secondary London listing ‚Äúin due course‚Äù."

In a speech to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum this afternoon, Mann warns that there are risks of ‚Äúcontinued inflation momentum and embedded persistence‚Äù, due to sluggish supply growth and the risk of ‚Äúupside shocks‚Äù. Mann explains that the UK jobs market is ‚Äústill relatively tight‚Äù and is loosening only slowly.  She also points out that financial conditions have eased substantially since September, as the markets have anticipated cuts to Bank Rate in the coming months. Mann says:  Inflation is the most pernicious of taxes, affecting all households, and those at lower incomes most severely. Considering both backward-looking outcomes and my forward-looking assessments and risks, I determined it was prudent to vote for another increase in Bank Rate. It was a finely balanced decision.  Mann was joined in her vote to raise interest rates to 5.5% by fellow policymaker Jonathan Haskel. Six of the nine committee members voted to hold rates, while one, Swati Dhingra, voted for a cut. Mann warns today that there is evidence of ‚Äúupward bias‚Äù by firms when they set their prices, which would add to inflationary pressures. The Bank of England forecasts that inflation will fall to its 2% target this spring, down from 4% in December, before rising by the end of the year She also fears that Middle East turmoil could quickly push up prices in the UK:  More immediately, upside risk to shipping and insurance costs associated with the Red Sea turmoil may affect near-term inflation outcomes and be magnified through firm-level price setting behaviors, which would augment persistence. I worry that such an upward inflation shock coming on the heels of the recent high inflation environment will be more swiftly incorporated into firms‚Äô costs and prices, exacerbating upside momentum, which is slow to dissipate when the inflation shock subsides.

Speaking at a conference in Westminster, CBI director general Rain Newton-Smith said that companies do not want to see tax reductions ‚Äúdriven by short-termism‚Äù. Newton-Smith argued that for growth to be truly sustainable, it must prevent persistent high inflation.  She says:  Business investment is set to fall five per cent this year, in part because of higher interest rates needed to bring inflation down. As one business leader told me, they don‚Äôt want to see tax cuts driven by short-termism which leads to higher interest rates. They want stability so they can invest for the future. To fund our public services with an ageing population, we must keep large-scale tax cuts off the table.  Last week, the International Monetary Fund issued a strong warning to Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes in his budget in March, stressing the need to boost key areas of public spending instead. Hunt had been hinting that the budget would include tax cuts. But following the IMF‚Äôs intervention, he played down the prospect, saying there was less room for tax reductions than hoped.   Related: Jeremy Hunt plays down talk of spring budget tax cut after IMF warning   Newton-Smith also called for green investment to be increased from ¬£10bn to ¬£50bn per year by 2030, so the UK can hit its net zero target by 2050. She says:  The majority will need to come from the private sector. But public sector investment in green technologies is essential as a catalyst to crowd that in. Whether that is de-risking Sustainable Aviation Fuels through contracts for difference, or helping our public buildings to move to low carbon heat and our social housing sector to insulate homes, lowering bills. Just look at the Port of Tyne, a fantastic CBI member I visited two weeks ago. Last year they secured ¬£100m for their Tyne 2050 project ‚Äì half catalytic public investment; half all-important private sector investment. But in the UK, overall public sector investment is too low and too volatile. The average OECD country invests nearly fifty per cent more.

However, it also expects revenues to fall by 3% to 4% this financial year, ‚Äútightening the previous expectation‚Äù of a 2-4% drop. Revenues fell 6% in the last quarter, Under Armour reports today. But gross margin increased 100 basis points to 45.2 percent, driven primarily by ‚Äúsupply chain benefits related to lower freight expense‚Äù.

Updated at 12.19pm GMT    12.01pm GMT   Santander UK have reportedly taken offence at an advert by rival Nationwide, in which Dominic West played an obnoxious bank chief. Sky News report that Santandar UK have filed a formal complaint with advertising watchdogs over a Nationwide campaign which ‚Äúdiscredits and denigrates‚Äù Britain‚Äôs high street banking industry. Sky‚Äôs Mark Kleinman explains:  Sky News has learnt that the Spanish-owned lender has told the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the Nationwide television commercial - featuring the actor Dominic West as an arrogant bank boss - is misleading about its rivals‚Äô approach to closing branches. The complaint was filed during the autumn, soon after the building society campaign launched, according to insiders, but has not been publicly disclosed.  The ASA has yet to adjudicate on the advert, in which West ‚Äì the boss of A.N.Y Bank - produces a massive lunch bill before proposing branch closures, declaring:  We‚Äôre not Nationwide, are we?

UK Finance reports that the number of homeowner mortgages in arrears increased by 7% in the last quarter of 2023, to 93,680. There was an 18% increase in buy-to-let mortgages in arrears, up to 13,570, as more landlords struggled to cope with higher borrowing costs. But although arrears are rising, the number of homeowner mortgaged homes being taken into possession dropped by 14% in the last quarter, to 540. Also, 500 BTL mortgaged properties were taken into possession in Q4, 11% greater than the previous quarter. That combined total of 1,040 repossessions in Q4 2023 is almost half the nearly 2,000 repossessed in the last three months of 2019, before the pandemic.

Deflation.  Prices have fallen at their steepest rate since 2009, with the consumer price index falling 0.8% compared to a year earlier. Although falling food prices, particularly pork, is partly behind the trend. This was exacerbated by sharply lower demand during the month compared to last year due to the lunar new year celebrations landing in February, but underlying weakness remains with non-food inflation falling back. China is still mired in a property slump, affecting wealth perceptions and making consumers more cautious about spending big. Small stimulus measures aimed at increasing trading activity and lending into the economy have helped revive the Chinese stock market this week, but these are likely to be sticking plasters rather than a longer-term treatment for sluggish economy.   Updated at 11.34am GMT    9.18am GMT   Shipping giant Maersk has warned that oversupply in the sector will hit its earning this year, prompting it to suspend its share buy-back programme. In new financial guidance for 2024, Maersk says it could make an underlying loss of up to $5bn this year, although it could manage to break even. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year will be between $1bn and $6bn, Maersk predicts, down from $9.6bn in 2023. And while the Red Sea crisis is pushing up shipping rates, market conditions are likely to remain challenging, it says. Vincent Clerc, CEO of A.P. Moller-Maersk, explains:  The current market remains one of robust volumes, but while the Red Sea crisis has caused immediate capacity constraints and a temporary increase in rates, eventually the oversupply in shipping capacity will lead to price pressure and impact our results.  The ongoing disruptions and market volatility emphasize the need for supply chain resilience, further confirming that Maersk‚Äôs path toward integrated logistics is the right choice for our customers to effectively manage these challenges.  Having benefitted from soaring shipping rates in the pandemic, Maersk‚Äôs earnings have been hit by the drop in prices to ship containers around the world. For 2023, it has reported profits on an EBIT basis of $3.9bn, down from $30.8bn in 2022. Last November, it announced 10,000 job cuts, due to the drop in demand triggered by the global economic slowdown.

SSE has reported that its SSE Renewables output over the last three quarters was around 15% below plan, having been hit by ‚Äúmixed weather conditions, short-term plant outages‚Äù and the rephasing of its flexible hydro output. SEE says that ‚Äúexceptionally still and dry weather conditions‚Äù hit output at its onshore wind, offshore wind and hydro business. Also, work on an offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank A has been disrupted by a series of storms. SSE says:  Turbine installation on Dogger Bank A has been affected by challenging weather conditions with vessel availability and supply chain delays further impacting progress.  SSE points out there have been 10 named storms in the 2023/24 season ‚Äì Agnes, Babet, Ciaran, Debi, Elin, Fergus, Gerrit, Henk, Isha, and Jocelyn.

Despite this, the company remains on target to meet its previous guidance for the year, with the transition to a rebased dividend that is part of its plans for shareholder returns combined with significant capex investment.

In plain English, it means that the Chinese efforts to boost growth and bring inflation back are not working according to the plan. Money poured into the Chinese system doesn‚Äôt circulate in a way to stimulate economy ‚Äì blame people who lost confidence ‚Äì and the radical measures that the government has put in place to prop up equity valuations hardly help China‚Äôs battered stock markets to get back on their feet. Today, sentiment in the CPI 300 index is mixed. I was writing yesterday that a deeper than expected deflation number will certainly encourage Chinese authorities to announce more stimulus measures. But measures alone won‚Äôt help getting the Chinese markets‚Äô heads above water if investors don‚Äôt play along. Another worry about the Chinese recovery is that because the Chinese dream has been dashed by a $7 trillion selloff in the equity markets, many could be tempted to take their loss and walk away in the slightest recovery. In summary, the road to a sustainable recovery seems far away.      7.33am GMT  ING: This is probably the bottom for China's inflation  China‚Äôs January‚Äôs -0.8% annual inflation reading could mark the low point in the current cycle, according to Lynn Song, ING‚Äôs chief economist for Greater China. Song argues that China is not trapped in a ‚Äúdeflationary spiral‚Äù, and predicts that pork prices could pick due to demand in this month‚Äôs Lunar new year holidays. Song explains:  Sequential data paints a more upbeat picture. In MoM terms, headline CPI rose 0.3%, food CPI rose 0.4%, and non-food CPI rose 0.2%. While a far cry from the above-target inflation levels seen in many other economies, these numbers do not imply China is stuck in a deflationary spiral. Furthermore, China‚Äôs pork cycle also indicates that the drag from pork prices will also fade in the coming months. While still a major drag in January‚Äôs data, pork price inflation has actually risen for the past two months, and the December 2023 MoM change in the pig stock was the largest decline since March 2022. With expected demand for the Lunar New Year holiday in February, this could return to positive growth in next month‚Äôs release.  As such, considering the more favourable base effects for February‚Äôs data, we see a high likelihood that January‚Äôs data could mark the low point for YoY inflation in the current cycle.       7.16am GMT  Introduction: China‚Äôs prices fall at fastest rate in 15 years as economy fights deflation  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Consumer prices across China are falling at the fastest pace in 15 years, as its economy struggles with weak demand. China‚Äôs consumer price index fell 0.8% year-on-year in January, data released this morning showed. It‚Äôs the fourth straight month of declines, and the biggest contraction since 2009 after the financial crisis. The inflation rate was dragged down by falling food prices, which dropped by 5.9% year-on-year in January. Pork prices dropped by 17%, and were a major drag on inflation, while fresh vegetables were 12.7% cheaper than a year ago and fruit cost 9.1% less.  üá®üá≥#inflation #China #reportingChina - consumer inflation CPI (Jan)m/m = +0.3% (expected +0.4% / previously +0.1%)y/y = -0.8% (expected -0.5% / previously -0.3%)Traditionally, the media write about deflation in ChinaThe fall in consumer prices in January was the strongest‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/75KSrAVMSA‚Äî FinNews (@FinNews_) February 8, 2024  China‚Äôs factories continued to cut their prices last month, too. The producer price index (PPI) slid 2.5% from a year earlier in January after a 2.7% fall the previous month. China‚Äôs consumer prices dropped into deflationary territory last summer, and prices have been flattish since. Its economy has struggled as the bounceback following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions falters, and as its indebted real estates sector contracts.   Related: China‚Äôs economy is struggling but fears of sustained deflation are premature   The drop in annual inflation puts more pressure on Beijing policymakers to take fresh steps to stimulate the economy. China‚Äôs stock markets have rallied a little today. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, says the markets have ‚Äúostensibly reacted favourably‚Äù to disappointing Chinese price data.  While a very concerning sign for China‚Äôs economy, which could be becoming entrenched in a debt and deflation cycle, the markets arguably responded in a positive way to the news. Perhaps markets see the terribly low number as a potential catalyst for more muscular monetary or fiscal stimulus from the central government, which, up until this point, has been moderate in applying countercyclical policy.   China CPI weakens further to -0,8%.

        "content": "China‚Äôs economy has gone from bad to worse ‚Äì and it is only February. Figures released on Thursday showed consumer prices fell by 0.8% in January compared with a year earlier, outstripping economists‚Äô expectations and marking the biggest contraction in 15 years. Prices in China have been flat or falling nearly continuously since July. Although the country‚Äôs zero-Covid policy was abandoned more than a year ago, consumers are still cautious about spending, both on everyday goods and on property, which has traditionally been the driver of growth in China‚Äôs gross domestic product. Income growth has slowed, and high unemployment rates are pushing down wages for some workers. Some economists are worried that persistently low demand in China could have knock-on effects around the world as it may start to rely on demand from other countries to revive its economy. That concern is especially acute as Beijing policymakers have tried to offset the downward spiral in the property sector by betting big on industrial manufacturing, particularly in green technologies such as electric vehicles and solar panels. Banks are being encouraged to increase lending to manufacturers, while loans to the real estate sector have decreased. A surge in exports could exacerbate tensions around trade tariffs and dumping. The UK is already investigating whether Chinese excavators are being sold at unfairly low prices, while the European Union has launched an anti-subsidy inquiry into Chinese electric vehicles, a move that has caused consternation in Beijing. ‚ÄúChina needs to take actions quickly and aggressively to avoid the risk of deflationary expectation to be entrenched among consumers,‚Äù Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at the Hong Kong-based asset manager PinPOINT, told Reuters. The National Bureau of Statistics of China said the year-on-year drop in consumer prices was partly explained by the fact that in 2023 the lunar new year holiday, which traditionally boosts spending, fell in January. This year it starts on 10 February. Analysts are now looking at whether the year of the dragon will breathe some much-needed fire into the belly of the Chinese economy. Food prices in particular, which fell 5.9% in January, are expected to get at least a short-term boost as people gather for festive feasting. One of the biggest drags on prices was pork, which slumped by 17%. But the longer term strains in China‚Äôs economy are proving stubborn. Unlike previous downturns, Beijing has not stepped in with a massive stimulus package. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, says he wants to focus on ‚Äúhigh quality growth‚Äù rather than the double-digit acceleration that China experienced in the early 2000s. All eyes are now on the Two Sessions, the country‚Äôs annual parliamentary meetings that start on 5 March. The growth target for 2024 is expected to be similar to last year‚Äôs 5%. That is modest by Chinese standards, but it may be the new normal for the world‚Äôs second-biggest economy."

        "content": "The former chief executive of Barclays Jes Staley allegedly stayed in contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after joining the UK bank, according to legal documents that reportedly contradict claims he cut ties with the convicted child sex offender and disgraced financier in 2015. Documents from a now-settled lawsuit, seen by Bloomberg News, allegedly suggest that the two men used an unnamed third person, who ‚Äúacted as an intermediary for messages between Staley and Epstein‚Äù, to stay in contact after Staley took over as chief executive of Barclays in December 2015. Supporting evidence allegedly suggests Epstein would send questions for Staley via the intermediary, who would pass them on verbally. The third person would then return Staley‚Äôs reply to Epstein in writing. The court documents were redacted to remove certain names. In one email, sent weeks after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, Epstein reportedly wrote: ‚ÄúCould you ask [REDACTED] if he would like to considered for treasury [sic].‚Äù The intermediary replied: ‚ÄúWill do. He‚Äôs on a plane to London right now but I‚Äôll reach him after.‚Äù The individual later added: ‚ÄúSpoke with him. He said not yet, but thanks.‚Äù Bloomberg said this was an apparent attempt to discuss the appointment of the Treasury secretary in Trump‚Äôs incoming administration. A few months later, in February 2017, Epstein was reportedly seeking an opinion on one of Staley‚Äôs former colleagues from JP Morgan, though redactions mean it is unclear whose opinion Epstein is seeking. ‚ÄúCan you ask [REDACTED] his opinion of V√©ronique Weill she wants to join rothschild [sic],‚Äù Epstein allegedly wrote. The go-between replied: ‚ÄúWill do. I will speak with him today and get back to you.‚Äù They later said: ‚ÄúHe thinks she is great and is a big fan of hers. Good recommendation for rothschild [sic].‚Äù Bloomberg contacted a spokesperson for Weill, who said: ‚ÄúShe [Weill] didn‚Äôt know Jeffrey Epstein and she has no knowledge of any such potential approach from him to Jes Staley.‚Äù The documents are from a lawsuit originally lodged by the US Virgin Islands against Staley‚Äôs former employer JP Morgan, which was settled in September for $75m (¬£60m). They appear to contradict previous comments from Staley, who in 2020 said his final contact with the financier was in ‚Äúmiddle to late 2015‚Äù, shortly before he took over as Barclays‚Äô chief executive. Staley resigned from the bank in November 2021, and last September was banned from holding any senior City role after the UK‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority ruled he had misled the regulator over his relationship with Epstein. The FCA said Staley continued to have contact with Epstein ‚Äì who pleaded guilty to soliciting sex from girls as young as 14 in 2008 ‚Äì up to at least 2015. It is not clear whether the FCA has a view of the allegations in the US Virgin Island lawsuit of continued contact between the pair. ‚ÄúWe have set out our case against Mr Staley clearly and will argue it in front of the tribunal,‚Äù the FCA said in a statement. ‚ÄúGiven the process is ongoing it is not appropriate to comment any further at this stage.‚Äù The watchdog would not confirm whether it was previously aware of the communications outlined in the reported legal documents. However, if information were to come to light that was relevant to the FCA‚Äôs case ‚Äì including Staley‚Äôs appeal at the upper tribunal ‚Äì the regulator would have scope to include it.  Staley is appealing against the FCA decision. An emailed statement provided by his lawyers in September said: ‚ÄúIf I had known who JE [Jeffrey Epstein] really was, there is absolutely no doubt that I wouldn‚Äôt be in the position I am in today. Prior to undertaking my former role, it was known that I had had a relationship with JE. ‚ÄúI am very disappointed by the FCA‚Äôs decision and I will continue to challenge it. I will not comment any further until these proceedings are concluded.‚Äù Staley‚Äôs lawyer did not immediately respond to the Guardian‚Äôs requests for comment regarding the Bloomberg News story. Barclays declined to comment."

Data released on Thursday showed that China‚Äôs consumer price index tumbled last month, falling by 0.8% compared with a year earlier. It marks the fourth consecutive month of declines, as well as the sharpest drop since September 2009, when the global economy was still grappling with aftershocks from the 2008 banking crisis.

It means that household demand for food such as pork could bounce back once next month‚Äôs data takes the holiday season into account. ‚ÄúWhile a far cry from the above-target inflation levels seen in many other economies, these numbers do not imply China is stuck in a deflationary spiral,‚Äù Song said. ‚ÄúConsidering the more favourable base effects for February‚Äôs data, we see a high likelihood that January‚Äôs data could mark the low point for year-on-year inflation in the current cycle,‚Äù she added. However, the prospect of fresh economic stimulus from Beijing to counter weaker demand was enough to send Chinese stocks higher on Thursday, with the Shanghai Composite rising by nearly 1.3%. ‚ÄúWhile a very concerning sign for China‚Äôs economy, which could be becoming entrenched in a debt and deflation cycle, the markets arguably responded in a positive way to the news,‚Äù said Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com. ‚ÄúPerhaps markets see the terribly low number as a potential catalyst for more muscular monetary or fiscal stimulus from the central government, which, up until this point, has been moderate in applying countercyclical policy.‚Äù"

Sign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  ‚ÄúOf great concern is price gouging in the electricity sector, a very concentrated industry at all levels,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúAs a possible example of market power, AGL data provides evidence of price discrimination against retail customers.‚Äù The report said there was evidence the big three electricity retailers were overcharging households compared with business customers, saying that for AGL ‚Äúfor every consumer bill of $1,000 there is an apparent ‚Äòexcess charge‚Äô of $205.61 relative to prices charged to large business customers and not accounted for by genuine price differences‚Äù. And it identified an ‚Äúapparent ‚Äòexcess charge‚Äô $348.24 in every AGL consumer gas bill of $1,000‚Äù.

However Nicks insisted it was a ‚Äúvery, very competitive market‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe have a large retail footprint but we compete with the likes of Origin Energy, Alinta,‚Äù he said. AGL announced on Thursday a half-year net profit of $576m compared with a loss of $1.075bn a year ago amid an energy shock and the impending closure of the coal-fired Liddell power station. Shares in AGL surged 13% or $1.04 to $9.02 in early trade as shareholders welcomed the solid results and interim dividend of 26 cents a share ‚Äì more than triple that of a year earlier. By mid-afternoon, the gain had been pared to 84 cents, or 10.6%, to$8.82. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose to $1.07bn in the half, up 78%.   Related: For corporations, greed is good ‚Äì so how can Australia really tackle price gouging? | John Quiggin   Revenue fell 20.8% to $6.18bn in the six months to 31 December, but the underlying profit of $399m was sharply higher than $87m a year earlier. The increase was driven by fewer plant outages and more stable market conditions, offset by being caught on the wrong side of contracts as wholesale prices fell. In line with a strong first-half, AGL pushed its FY24 guidance for underlying profit to the top of the guidance range at $680m to $780m. Nicks said the strong operational and financial performance provided ‚Äúheadroom‚Äù for investment in the future business and energy transition. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a very strong six months, we‚Äôve doubled the (development) pipeline and we are investing in the future of the energy transition,‚Äù he said. AGL was responding to market pressure to exit coal-fired power generation over the next 12 years, Nicks said. In the meantime, coal-fired power plants can ‚Äúflex‚Äù in the middle of the day when solar energy is dominant and prices are low.   Related: Australia should develop solar PV sector to avoid dependence on China, report finds   AGL‚Äôs chief financial officer, Gary Brown, said it was too early to comment on the price outlook for FY25. He said AGL was well placed to deploy $3bn to $4bn by 2030 towards the transition of its energy generation portfolio, supported by strong cashflow and a larger and more diversified pool of capital. AGL said wholesale energy prices were lower across all states after government coal and price cap schemes introduced in 2022 and increased availability of generation units. Wholesale prices were also affected by seasonal mild weather, a lack of volatility and increasingly higher penetration of solar in the national electricity market. AGL‚Äôs total fuel costs for gas and coal generation fell 28.6% in the first six months of FY24."

        "content": "Victory in the war on inflation will require British workers to accept lower pay deals and companies to rein in their profits, a senior Bank of England policymaker has said. Sarah Breeden, one of the central bank‚Äôs four deputy governors, said there was still ‚Äúsome way to go‚Äù before inflation would fall back to the 2% target set by the government for the Bank to achieve on a sustainable basis. In a speech almost a week after she and fellow policymakers kept interest rates unchanged at the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, she said inflation in the service sector of the economy remained too high to meet the Bank‚Äôs target. ‚ÄúSome combination of moderation in pay pressures and firms‚Äô margins will be required for services inflation to return to more normal rates,‚Äù she said. Threadneedle Street has stressed that it needs to see more evidence of inflation falling back to its target, and sticking at those levels, before it can deliver its first cut in interest rates since the start of the Covid pandemic. Inflation tumbled to 4% in December, according to the latest official figures, having dropped from more than 10% a year earlier. Most economists expect it will fall below 2% within months amid a decline in global energy prices. Financial markets anticipate that falling inflation and near-stagnant economic growth should open the door to the Bank cutting interest rates by as much as one percentage point this year, from the current level of 5.25%. The Bank‚Äôs policymakers are, however, concerned that underlying inflationary pressures from the domestic economy could drive inflation closer to 3% by the end of the year, highlighting risks from rising service sector prices and resilient wage increases. Speaking at an event for the UK Women in Economics Network, Breeden said that indicators of annual pay growth remained in the 6-7% range, significantly higher than recorded in recent years. ‚Äú[This is] still elevated and, given the current weakness in productivity growth, several percentage points higher than what is consistent with the inflation target, were they to persist,‚Äù she said. Annual growth in average workers‚Äô earnings, excluding bonuses, dipped to 6.6% in the three months to November, down from a peak of almost 8% in July ‚Äì the highest level since comparable records began in 2001. However, the figures come amid a marked slowdown in the UK labour market, including a steady decline in vacancies and rising levels of unemployment. Figures from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and the accountancy firm KPMG published on Thursday show that the growth in starting salaries eased further in January, alongside a sustained drop in permanent job starts. The monthly survey, which is closely watched by the Bank for early warning signs from the economy, found permanent salary inflation had dropped to a 34-month low, highlighting ‚Äúongoing uncertainty around the economic outlook‚Äù. Neil Carberry, the REC‚Äôs chief executive, said: ‚ÄúThe labour market‚Äôs resilience is a great strength of the British economy ‚Äì but it can‚Äôt last for ever without sustained economic growth. ‚ÄúPay has normalised, inflation is dropping, and the hiring market has been cooling for a year now ‚Äì it‚Äôs high time that the Bank of England starts releasing the brake pedal on our economy.‚Äù"

In August, Edward Blum, the conservative legal activist who brought affirmative action back to the supreme court, sued a venture capital firm that awarded grants to Black women entrepreneurs. Blum, through his group the American Alliance for Equal Rights, argued that the firm, called Fearless Fund, was discriminating against white entrepreneurs by making the grant exclusively for Black women. The case could eventually make its way to the supreme court, where it would face the same panel of conservative judges that overturned affirmative action. The letter comes a week after conservative judges in Miami heard arguments in Fearless Fund‚Äôs case. A separate federal court in September had blocked the firm from awarding $20,000 grants to Black entrepreneurs, largely coming from corporations like Mastercard and Bank of America, pending the outcome of the case. In Miami, lawyers for Fearless Fund argued that the grants are protected by the first amendment because they are charitable donations. Kevin Newsom, a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump, asked the lawyers if a grant program for only white applicants would also be protected by the first amendment. ‚ÄúNo matter how repugnant I might find that, the first amendment protects all speech,‚Äù Jason Schwartz, a lawyer for Fearless Fund, told the judge. At a news conference after the hearing, Arian Simone, co-founder of Fearless Fund said that they lost ‚Äúupwards about eight figures of investments‚Äù following the lawsuit‚Äôs filing. ‚ÄúWhen people hear lawsuits, sometimes the spirit of fear has gotten to them,‚Äù Simone said. ‚ÄúWe have been financially impacted due to this lawsuit.‚Äù"

        "content": "The way the bosses of the two companies told it, Barratt Developments‚Äô proposed ¬£2.5bn takeover of smaller rival Redrow was ‚Äúa compelling opportunity‚Äù to do lots of virtuous things, such as increase the supply of new homes in the UK and give customers more choice. That, at least, is what they‚Äôll be telling the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which may yet have something to say about the UK‚Äôs biggest housebuilder by volume buying the sixth largest. More consolidation at the top of the industry hardly seems likely to offer much encouragement to smaller developers who built 39% of new homes back in 1988 but these days do about one in 10. None of which is to deny that Barratt‚Äôs move makes sense for it. It‚Äôs just that the financial logic looks defensive. Most deal-making in this industry is driven by land pipelines, the essential currency of housebuilding, and one can see how the numbers stack up for Barratt on that score. It will get 24,500 plots to add to its 68,000. In the open market, it might take Barratt 18 months to acquire such a portfolio ‚Äì and, given the housebuilder‚Äôs size, the task would be impossible to achieve without moving market prices. It‚Äôs worth paying up for such a job lot, which also spreads the risks of getting through a sticky planning system that has become stickier. And, happily for Barratt, it can afford to do so in an all-share transaction because its own share price (530p before announcement) was trading above book value. A chunky-looking 27% takeover premium for Redrow can therefore be justified. It was enough to persuade Steve Morgan, the developer‚Äôs astute founder and 16% shareholder, to sign up. If he‚Äôs on board, Redrow‚Äôs other investors will follow. On top, there will be cost savings to share around the combined entity, which, boringly, will be called Barratt Redrow rather than, say, Barrow. Those are also easy to understand. It is relatively simple to find savings by harmonising supply chains and closing overlapping regional offices. The one-off costs of integration are put at ¬£73m, so an annually recurring prize of ‚Äúat least ¬£90m‚Äù by the third year is attractive. It is certainly more convincing than the Barratt chief executive David Thomas‚Äôs elaborate pitch about a three-pronged brand strategy (the third one being the acquirer‚Äôs existing David Wilson name). At the margin, maybe carving up a development site between brands nominally aimed at first-time buyers, families and ‚Äúdownsizers‚Äù helps to shift more units more quickly. But would-be buyers are surely more interested in the quality of the home rather than the marketing spiel about differentiation. For outsiders, the real test is whether the deal will really increase the supply of new homes. The promises on that front were gloriously loose ‚Äì there will be ‚Äúa capacity to accelerate‚Äù to more than 22,000 homes a year ‚Äúin the medium term‚Äù. Well, maybe in a very good year. But the combined starting point, to judge by recent trading (including the 29% fall in completions for Barratt at the half-year), is a long way short of that. This deal, then, works for the companies, even if the stock market reaction was muted (Barratt‚Äôs shares fell by 5%, Redrow‚Äôs rose 15%). But any wider benefits are hard to spot. This looks like two companies coming together to get through a slow trading period by reaping some savings and waiting to see whether sales pick up. The CMA, which helpfully has a study on the housebuilding market in progress, should have a proper poke around the rafters."

But one airline is upping the stakes by inviting passengers to step on the scales too. The Finnish airline Finnair started the voluntary weighing in policy at departure gates at Helsinki airport on Monday with the aim of enabling it to better estimate the weight of its planes‚Äô cargo before takeoff. To the airline‚Äôs surprise, by Wednesday it had already had 600 volunteers. While Finnair insists passengers are not penalised for their weight, and that the numbers are kept discreet, away from prying eyes, they are not hugely compensated for sharing it either. Those who agree to take part are thanked for their efforts with a small gift of a reflective baggage tag. Suvi Aaltonen, a Finnair spokesperson, said: ‚ÄúOur customers have taken it really positively so far. We‚Äôve been quite surprised by people wanting to take part.‚Äù Despite each aircraft having a fixed maximum weight that cannot be exceeded if it is to be safe to fly, the weight of passengers and their carry-on luggage is usually only based on average passenger weights updated every five years. The weight of the passenger and their hand luggage is recorded as one number. The results of the weigh-ins, set to continue until May, will be sent to the Finnish transport and communications agency, Traficom, and used for aircraft balance and loading calculations from next year until 2030. Satu Munnukka, the head of ground processes at Finnair, said the measurements were being collected for safety purposes and were ‚Äúnot linked in any way to the customer‚Äôs personal data‚Äù. Munnukka added: ‚ÄúWe record the total weight and background information of the customer and their carry-on baggage but we do not ask for the name or booking number, for example. Only the customer service agent working at the measuring point can see the total weight, so you can participate in the study with peace of mind.‚Äù"

The bank‚Äôs stock has fallen by more than 60% to its lowest level in decades in recent days despite a scramble by the mid-sized lender to reassure investors of its financial strength. It first set off alarm bells on Wall Street a week ago by revealing a surprise quarterly loss and cutting its dividend for shareholders. NYCB‚Äôs rapid stock market rout comes less than a year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) unleashed a regional banking crisis that roiled the industry. Last May First Republic became the largest US lender to fail since 2008. In an effort to tackle concerns, on Tuesday NYCB released a mid-quarter update on its financial health. On Wednesday, it announced that the banking industry veteran Alessandro DiNello would become its executive chairman with immediate effect. But trading of the bank‚Äôs stock remained volatile. After starting the day marginally higher following news of DiNello‚Äôs appointment, shares in NYCB quickly fell back into the red. By mid-morning in New York, they were down 10.2% at $3.77. NYCB was dealt a fresh blow on Tuesday evening when Moody‚Äôs Investors Service downgraded its long-term debt ratings to junk status. Last week NYCB revealed a $252m loss, with a $552m provision for credit losses that sparked concern about its exposure to the commercial real estate market. Other regional banking stocks have also come under pressure in recent days. DiNello will work with NYCB‚Äôs executives ‚Äúto improve all aspects of the bank‚Äôs operations‚Äù, it said in a statement. On a call with analysts, DiNello acknowledged the lender was in a ‚Äúserious situation‚Äù but stressed that it ‚Äúremains strong‚Äù. NYCB grew significantly last year. The bank‚Äôs assets swelled beyond $100bn after its purchase of the assets of Signature Bank, which failed in the aftermath of SVB‚Äôs collapse in the spring. Based in Hicksville, New York, NYCB finished last year with deposits of $81.4bn. As of Tuesday evening, DiNello claimed that its deposit base had grown. The lender has 420 branches."

The rise in goods exports was fairly broad based, although it included fairly large gains in the volatile non-monetary gold and pharmaceuticals categories, while exports of services also rose quite strongly. In a potentially positive sign for consumption, imports were driven higher by a particularly big rise in consumer goods imports, although that too included a fairly big gain in pharmaceuticals.      2.10pm GMT    $UBER conference call summary: We had a standout quarter and year, and we exceeded our outlook for the quarter.

The WSJ adds:  The total value of transactions on its app grew 22% to $37.58 billion. Uber‚Äôs revenue, or its cut from those transactions, increased 15% to $9.93 billion. The quarterly figures were slightly higher than Wall Street‚Äôs expectations.      1.10pm GMT  Uber posts first operating profit as public company  Ride-hire company Uber has reported its first full-year of operating profits since it floated on the stock market five years ago. Uber has reported it made income from operations of $1.11bn in 2023, up from a loss of $1.832bn in 2022, beating expectations. Revenues grew 17% last year, lifted by a 24% jump in trips in Uber vehicles.  ‚Äú2023 was an inflection point for Uber, proving that we can continue to generate strong, profitable growth at scale,‚Äù said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO, adding:   ‚ÄúOur audiences are larger and more engaged than ever, with our platform powering an average of nearly 26 million daily trips last year.‚Äù  Uber had consistently made an operating loss since debuting on Wall Street in May 2019. Losses rose from $3bn in 2018 to $8.6bn in 2019, before dropping to $4.86bn in 2020, $3.8bn in 2021 and then $1.832bn in 2022. Profits last year were driven by higher demand for mobility bookings (ride hires) as well as deliveries (Uber Eats). Bookings grew by 8% quarter-on-quarter, while deliveries were 6% higher quarter-on-quarter. Uber predicts that core profits and gross bookings will be strong in the first quarter of this year. For Q1 2024, it predicts:  Gross Bookings of $37.0 billion to $38.5 billion Adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion to $1.34 billion  That would be an increase on the adjusted EBITDA profits of $1.283bn in Q4 2023, driven by $37.5bn of gross bookings in the last quarter. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says:  ‚ÄúIt was a fantastic quarter for Uber, which shows that the long-term post-pandemic turnaround in the company is finally beginning to bear fruit. As we prepare for a faster-growth environment in the second semester of the year, particularly as financial conditions begin to improve, it is likely that the company will be perfectly positioned to lead the ride-hailing space in its quest for new innovations.‚ÄúThe most positive point in this report for long-term investors was the company‚Äôs ability to show sustained improvement in its EBITDA margins and cash flows. This is likely to provide the company with serious competitive advantages going forward.

In a new research note, Fitch predict that the banks‚Äô strong earnings power, capital, and liquidity buffers will help them handle the aisks arising from ‚Äúthe tough macroeconomic environment‚Äù. Fitch explains:  The effects of higher interest rates on the UK economy will be increasingly visible in 2024.  This will affect the UK banks‚Äô performance, but we expect that asset-quality deterioration, higher funding costs and competitive pressure on lending margins will affect the performance of the largest banks only slightly.  Profitability should remain strong, despite our expectations for net interest margins to contract, reflecting higher interest rates, structural hedge income, manageable loan impairment charges and controlled cost growth.  Recent increases in UK interest rates bolstered bank profits last year, attracting criticism from MPs who urged banks to pass on higher rates to savers as quickly as to borrowers.

Breeden is giving a speech now to the UK Women in Economics Annual Networking Event. In it, she explains that the pace of pay growth, and price rises by companies, will determine how soon UK interest rates should be cut. And she says she has become ‚Äúless concerned‚Äù that UK interest rates may need to be increased higher than their current 16-year high of 5.25%. Breeden, who is a member of the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy committee, says:  As I have become more confident that persistence is likely to evolve as embodied within our forecast, I have become less concerned that rates might need to be tightened further. Instead my focus, and indeed the focus of many on the MPC, has shifted to thinking about how long rates need to remain at their current level.  That fits with the City‚Äôs view that rates are now at their peak, and are likely to be cut at least three times during 2024. That expectation has pushed down mortgage costs in recent weeks, helping house prices to recover in January (as Halifax reported this morning). Breeden is one of the six policymakers who voted to leave rates on hold last week, outvoting two who wanted a rise and one who pushed for a cut. Breeden says she will be looking to see how pay growth and demand are influencing firms‚Äô pricing decisions, when deciding if inflation is returning sustainably to the Bank‚Äôs 2% target. In the speech, she points out that wage growth appears to have slowed, but remains in the 6%-7% range ‚Äì three times higher than the Bank‚Äôs inflation target. She also suggests that the resilience in the housing market be a signal that demand is stronger than the Bank expect. Yesterday, fellow MPC member Swati Dhingra argued that the Bank was taking a risk by not cutting rates immediately (as she voted for last week).

The all-share nature of the deal is astute, retaining a robust balance sheet.  Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says it‚Äôs a ‚Äúseismic‚Äù deal:  The move is a seismic shift for the sector, reflecting not only the challenges which housebuilders have more recently faced in terms of the economic backdrop, but also a move to shore up the capabilities of two major players, with the new ‚ÄúBarratt Redrow‚Äù company having aggregate revenues of ¬£7.45 billion. Subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, the aim is to complete the deal in the second half of this year, with Redrow becoming the premium brand in the enlarged portfolio.  Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:   ‚Äò‚ÄôThe economic winds have not been kind to the housebuilders and Barratt Developments and Redrow clearly believe they‚Äôll be stronger together, giving the new combined company much bigger clout to capitalise on the structural need for housing in the UK. Redrow‚Äôs board of directors intend to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the ¬£2.52 billion deal, which would give them 32.8% of the combined group, with Barratt shareholders holding 67.2%.      8.30am GMT   Shares in Barratt have dropped by 6% in early trading, as the City digests its takeover of rival Redrow.

Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury plc, says:  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to build on what‚Äôs driven our success since 2020. We‚Äôre determined to be First Choice for Food, ensuring more customers in more of our stores can enjoy more brilliant Sainsbury‚Äôs food. That means more space for our food offer, while still delivering the general merchandise products customers want from us. That way, not only will we find more ways to delight new and existing customers, we will also continue growing volume market share.  Elsewhere in the store, Sainsbury‚Äôs says it will ‚Äútighten the focus‚Äù of its general merchandise and clothing ranges ‚Äì which only half its customers currently buy. The plan aims to cut costs by ¬£1bn through improved technology and infrastructure, although it will incur one-off costs of ¬£150m to roll it out.

Barratt is paying ¬£2.524bn to buy Redrow‚Äôs shares, which is a 27.2% premium to last night‚Äôs closing price. David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt, claims the deal will lead to more ‚Äòhigh-quality‚Äô homes being built:  ‚ÄúWe have great respect for Redrow, its overall strategy, its leadership and employees, and its high-quality homes and communities. This is an exciting opportunity to bring together two highly complementary companies, creating an exceptional homebuilder in terms of quality, service and sustainability, able to build more of the high-quality homes this country needs. The Combined Group would leverage the respective strengths of both Barratt and Redrow, delivering significant benefits to our people, our supply chains, and - most importantly - our customers.‚Äù  Matthew Pratt, chief executive of Redrow, said:  ‚ÄúRedrow and Barratt combined creates a leading UK homebuilder. Together, we‚Äôll be in a much better position to offer a broader range of high-quality and energy efficient homes to customers.

Now, however, the economy has started to stabilise, and it‚Äôs encouraging that large lenders are responding the right way to inflation coming under control by bringing down interest rates.  ‚ÄúThough the Bank of England held the base interest rate at their latest meeting, it has started sending signals that it may start lowering them soon. This will likely be done with caution, and rates will only drop in small increments, but it could nonetheless be a real watershed moment for the housing market, prompting a groundswell of home buying activity.      7.18am GMT   The UK housing market has made a ‚Äúpositive start‚Äù to 2024, says Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, after rising 1.3% in January (and 2.5% over the last year). Kinnaird explains:  ‚ÄúThe recent reduction of mortgage rates from lenders as competition picks up, alongside fading inflationary pressures and a still-resilient labour market has contributed to increased confidence among buyers and sellers. This has resulted in a positive start to 2024‚Äôs housing market. However, while housing activity has increased over recent months, interest rates remain elevated compared to the historic lows seen in recent years and demand continues to exceed supply. For those looking to buy a first home, the average deposit raised is now ¬£53,414, around 19% of the purchase price. It‚Äôs not surprising that almost two thirds (63%) of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names.

MPs have accused the Bank of England of taking a ‚Äúleap in the dark‚Äù as it offloads hundreds of billions of pounds worth of government debt at discount prices. A report by the Treasury committee released this morning said the central bank had failed to fully consider the broader economic consequences should the sale crystalise a loss of up to ¬£130bn, with the government forced to make up the shortfall. MPs said they feared the benefits of the quantitative easing (QE) programme, which has involved the purchase of ¬£875bn of govenment debt since the 2008 financial crisis, would be reversed under a process known as quantitative tightening (QT), having knock-on implications for public spending. Committee chair, Harriett Baldwin, said:  ‚ÄúIt has become clear during the course of this inquiry that the decision to undertake a period of quantitative tightening is a leap in the dark for the UK economy. ‚ÄúI recognise that the Bank of England does not have a crystal ball and is in uncharted waters, but more can be done to develop forecasting and modelling tools which can help us understand the risks and benefits of QT.‚Äù  The Bank of England embarked on its QE programme in tandem with other central banks to stimulate lending in the economy. But the scheme was only expected to last a couple of years and the bonds purchased were expected to be sold at a modest loss. Fourteen years later, and following a dramatic increase in interest rates, government bonds have lost value and could be sold, depending on the path of interest rates, at an estimated ¬£50bn to ¬£130bn loss over the next decade.   Related: Bank of England set to incur ¬£150bn loss from bond sales after interest rate rises   ‚ÄúThe Committee determines that decisions are being taken regarding vast amounts of taxpayers‚Äô money without any regard to value for money,‚Äù the report said, adding:  ‚ÄúWhile acknowledging the need to keep monetary policy and inflation as their foremost monetary focus, the committee asks the Bank of England and Treasury to explore how value-for money criteria could be included in decisions about the ongoing pace of QT and to consider what lessons can be learned about how QE should be used in future.‚Äù  The Bank of England would only say in response:  ‚ÄúWe welcome the committee‚Äôs report and will consider its findings carefully before responding. We continue to encourage active debate about our monetary policy decisions and their implementation‚Äù.

Its chair, Thomas Thune Andersen, will step down after almost a decade in the role, after the two senior executives who left the business in November. The company, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said the ‚Äúreset plan‚Äù was designed to make it a ‚Äúleaner and more efficient company‚Äù. √òrsted has struggled in the face of high inflation, supply-chain disruption and rising interest rates, which have hit the windfarm industry. The company has also experienced problems in the US in attempting to secure tax credits. Last year, √òrsted cancelled two big offshore windfarm projects in the US, the Ocean Wind I and II schemes, blaming a sharp rise in costs. It took a 28.4bn Danish kroner (¬£3.3bn) hit as a result of the decision. The company had also raised doubts over the cost of the Hornsea 3 project early last year. However, in December it reaffirmed its commitment to 2.9GW development, which is expected to supply power to 3.3m homes. The RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler said financial markets had been expecting √òrsted to tap investors for funds, ‚Äúwhich would have resolved the issues quicker and removed future risk in this regard‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúHowever, we now have a period where √òrsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to improve its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.‚Äù √òrsted has 12 existing windfarms in the UK producing enough energy to power 6m UK homes. It is also working on a floating offshore wind project in Scotland. Separately on Wednesday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy, which was forced to strike a ‚Ç¨15bn (¬£12.8bn) rescue deal with the German government last year, reported a ‚Ç¨1.58bn first-quarter profit after selling a stake in its Indian unit. It said orders remained lower than forecast in its turbine division, where newer models have suffered technical faults, but it hoped to break even in that business in 2026. The problems affecting the windfarm industry caused the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall to stop work on the multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm last year because it was no longer profitable. The Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor posted quarterly profits of $8.68bn ‚Äì down from $17bn a year earlier but ahead of City forecasts ‚Äì due to lower energy prices. Meanwhile, the British Gas owner Centrica signed an agreement to buy a million metric tonnes of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Spain‚Äôs Repsol. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent between 2025 and 2027. Britain has a collection of gas terminals, providing fuel for domestic use and to be re-exported. Germany has raced to bolster its ability to import shipped LNG since piped Russian gas supplies dropped after the invasion of Ukraine, while the US last month moved to curb gas exports by pausing all pending export permits amid climate concerns. The new chief executive of BP said on Tuesday the oil and gas company would take a ‚Äúmore pragmatic‚Äù approach to reaching its green targets. Shell faced calls to speed up its investment in renewable energy last week, as it announced bumper profits and shareholder payouts and increased oil and gas production. In January, gas-fired power stations provided the largest share of Great Britain‚Äôs electricity supply, at 35.7%, ahead of wind power at 33.5%, National Grid said this week. "

Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury‚Äôs, did not rule out job losses as a result of the changes, but made no announcement on redundancies and said workers would be able to change their roles and adapt to new ways of working. Roberts said the group‚Äôs ‚Äúlegacy systems‚Äù were slowing it down and leading to more waste than necessary. ‚ÄúWe have got to find better ways of doing things,‚Äù he said. He said Sainsbury‚Äôs was ‚Äúcapitalising on [its] scale and investing at a time when many others can‚Äôt‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are in a really strong position,‚Äù he said, promising that Sainsbury‚Äôs would buy back ¬£200m of shares this year in a bonus for investors. Referring to the heavy debt burdens of rivals such as Asda and Morrisons, after both were bought out in private-equity deals in recent years, Roberts said: ‚ÄúMany of our competitors will not be able to make those investments or make them cost-effectively at this point in time. I think this is what will really bring out the winners in this industry.‚Äù As part of up to ¬£850m in annual investment for the next three years, Sainsbury‚Äôs will also rejig 180 of its supermarkets to make more space for food, especially fresh produce, while shifting out products also sold in its Argos outlets such as electrical gadgets. This year, an additional ¬£70m will go towards putting electric vehicle fast chargers beside 70 supermarkets, after their success at 27 existing sites. Sainsbury‚Äôs is also expanding its Nectar loyalty scheme, adding new digital capabilities, and expects the programme to add ¬£100m to its profits over three years, up from a target of ¬£90m over four years.   Related: The truth about loyalty cards: discounts, data collection and the very best deals   The scheme‚Äôs special discounts for members, launched last year, have been credited with helping Sainsbury‚Äôs pull in more shoppers but have attracted the attention of the competition watchdog which is looking at loyalty schemes run by all the major supermarkets. Sainsbury‚Äôs has recently gained market share, winning over shoppers by keeping a lid on prices with ¬£780m of investment over the past three years, making it more competitive with the likes of Aldi, Lidl and Tesco. Roberts said the group had ‚Äúdone the lion‚Äôs share‚Äù of the investment required on price and was improving the volume of items sold. While the business would aim to maintain its current position, Roberts said the supermarket could put money into other areas. ‚ÄúI think we are only really at the beginning of what this business is really capable of,‚Äù he said. Roberts said Sainsbury‚Äôs would be making more space for food aisles in 180 stores so more shoppers could have access to its full range and the business would have a better chance of ensuring availability of fast-selling lines. The group also plans to open 25 more convenience stores a year."

        "content": "Thames Water has been ordered to update its service commitment plan by the regulator Ofwat after a minister said the company‚Äôs performance in regards to sewage dumping and serving customers was ‚Äúcompletely unacceptable‚Äù. Robbie Moore, the floods minister, said Britain‚Äôs biggest water supplier was ‚Äúunder no illusions over the scale of the challenge‚Äù as MPs heard that Thames had allowed waterways to become polluted and homes to be flooded with sewage. At a Westminster Hall debate on the performance of the company in Oxfordshire, Moore said: ‚ÄúOfwat have directed Thames Water to produce a service commitment plan. ‚ÄúThis will require Thames Water to publicly commit to a plan for how they will start to turn their performance around. Please be assured that regulators and the government will be scrutinising these plans in detail to make sure every possible is being done to get the company back on track in terms of service delivery, environmental performance and ensuring that the customers get what they quite rightly deserve in terms of good supply.‚Äù Debt-laden Thames has been repeatedly criticised for its record on sewage dumping and leakage, while fears have been raised about its financial position after auditors said it could run out of money by April. Thames last published a commitment plan in December, which was updated in January. ‚ÄúOur underlying performance is improving in some areas, but deteriorating asset health, climatic events and cost pressures, means our current performance is falling short of expectations,‚Äù the plan said. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said: ‚ÄúOur local environment is under threat thanks, in part, to the shoddy performance of Thames Water. The dumping of sewage in our rivers, failing to unblock drains, failing to fill reservoirs and they don‚Äôt deliver value for money.‚Äù Moran recounted anecdotes from her constituents, including an angler who witnessed faeces ‚Äúfloat past the end of his fishing rod‚Äù and a dog owner who claimed his greyhound, named Roy, died when it fell ill shortly after entering raw sewage. There is also a row over plans to build a 150bn-litre reservoir, spanning almost two miles across, to the south-west of Abingdon. Moran said her constituents had ‚Äúno faith‚Äù that Thames can deliver the project. She said the company had been ‚Äúhorrifically mismanaged‚Äù and called for a public inquiry into the reservoir plans. She said executive bonuses should be blocked in the water industry ‚Äúuntil the sewage dumping stops‚Äù. Moore said independent analysis had shown that stopping storm overflows completely would cost between ¬£120bn and ¬£600bn, adding ¬£271 to ¬£817 a year to bills, by 2049. The industry has committed to spend ¬£60bn by 2050, after years of under investment. Moore said the government had also given the Environment Agency an extra ¬£2.2m a year to carry out enforcement action after concerns about understaffing. The outcome of a joint investigation by the Environment Agency and Ofwat into practices at sewage treatment works is expected to be announced within the next two months, industry sources said. Moore said: ‚ÄúIt is critical that all water companies, including Thames Water clean up their act, behave transparently and take urgent action to improve their performance where they fall short. If they do not achieve this, this government shall not hesitate in holding them to account.‚Äù Ofwat said it had received Thames Water‚Äôs latest plan last week and had asked the company to provide quarterly updates on its progress. Thames Water said: ‚ÄúOur plan was published on 5 December and voluntarily updated on 31 January. We have committed to provide Ofwat with quarterly updates on our performance.‚Äù"

The final batch will roll off the Swiss food firm‚Äôs production lines this month, with the decision blamed on dwindling sales of the 54-year-old brand. ‚ÄúWe know fans will be disappointed to see it go,‚Äù said a Nestl√© spokesperson. ‚ÄúWe have seen a decline in the sales of Breakaway over the past few years and, unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to discontinue it.‚Äù For biscuit eaters of a certain age, even those who have not bought a pack for ages, the catchy 1983 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take away my Breakaway‚Äù ad jingle is indelibly planted in their brain. The cartoon memorably featured the ‚Äúmeanest geezer in the city‚Äù being pulled into line by his mum‚Äôs threat: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take away your Breakaway.‚Äù The decision is another blow for consumers who often struggle to let go of the brands beloved of their youth. At the end of last year there was outrage after Nestl√© similarly canned Caramac, ending what for some had been a 60-year love affair with the caramel-flavoured bar. Fans of the Breakaway took to X, formerly Twitter, to complain. Carrie @Crystal18429762 spoke for many: ‚ÄúAfter buying Breakaway chocolate biscuits for the past three decades the manufacturers have announced that they are to stop making them in March. Yet another thing from the past being done away with. Such a lovely biscuit too.‚Äù Other X users were less heartfelt to see a treat launched in 1970 by Rowntree Mackintosh ‚Äì which was acquired by Nestl√© in 1988 ‚Äì dispatched to biscuit heaven: ‚ÄúI patiently await the petition to sign,‚Äù said one with tongue firmly in cheek. In the same breath Nestl√© also called time on Yorkie biscuit bars but thank goodness not the full-chocolate version, with the company confirming those are ‚Äústaying for good‚Äù. Nestl√© said the clear-out of older brands meant it could focus on its best-performing confectionery, as well as ‚Äúdevelop exciting new innovations to delight consumers‚Äô tastebuds‚Äù. Those in need of a final Breakway fix will be able to find packs in Sainsbury‚Äôs throughout February and March while stocks last. If you are more concerned about what will happen next in this biscuit end times, the future of the stablemate Blue Riband appears to be secure, for the time being at least. A new version, Blue Riband Hazelnut, arrives on shelves this month."

        "content": "Despite a new year and a new way of doing things, the thinking at the Reserve Bank remains the same ‚Äì inflation is all about people having too much money to spend rather than the actions of companies which are actually the ones raising prices. With the first Reserve Bank board meeting of the year behind us ‚Äì and the first under the new arrangements where the board only meets every six weeks rather than monthly ‚Äì the prospect of more rate rises looks unlikely. While the governor, Michele Bullock, tried to talk a big game about the RBA still being worried about inflation, few believe that will mean higher rates. The market for some time now has pretty much banked in a rate cut by August and a few more to follow:    If this graph does not display, click here And yet my concern is that the RBA, despite the new arrangements, which include a much shorter and less fussy statement by the board, continues to see inflation as a nail that can only be hammered by interest rates. The latest statement on monetary policy, also released on Tuesday, makes this very clear when it rather blithely states on the summary page in bold that ‚Äúoverall demand is still greater than supply, but the economy is moving towards a better balance‚Äù. Excuse me. Demand is greater than supply? By what measure? And is it because we have too much demand or too little supply? Because if it is the latter, interest rates rises won‚Äôt do a thing.   Related: Inflation‚Äôs under control ‚Äì now it‚Äôs time to worry about the economic health of households | Greg Jericho   The RBA has now downgraded GDP growth for 2023 from 1.6% to 1.5%. And whereas in November it thought the economy this year would grow by (a still pathetic) 1.8% in the year to June 2024, now it predicts a mere 1.3% growth. The bank also estimates that gross national expenditure (GNE), which is essentially GDP minus trade, grew a lousy 1.4% across 2023 and expects it to rise to a very tepid 1.9% by the end of this year. During the period from the end of 2011 until the end of 2019 when the RBA cut the cash rate from 4.5% to 0.75% in an attempt to stimulate the economy, GNE averaged annual growth of 2%. But now apparently growth of 1.4% is a sign that we have too much demand in the economy!    If this graph does not display, click here Perhaps the RBA thinks we are all getting paid too much? That would seem odd given the RBA also now estimates real wages grew just 0.1% in 2023 and by the end of this year will only be growing at 0.4%. That means average Australian real wages are now 4.5% below where they were at the end of 2019 and by the middle of 2026 will only be back at 2011 levels:    If this graph does not display, click here Maybe it‚Äôs not wages but all the other income we have that is fueling this excess demand? Certainly during the pandemic, stimulus such as temporary (and now finished) increases in the low-middle income tax offset boosted our incomes. But the RBA estimates that not only have we lost all that pandemic stimulus, we are now back to where we were in 2019. Even worse, total household disposable income is an astonishing 5.1% below where we would have expected it to be given the trend of the decade before the pandemic:    If this graph does not display, click here Of course, the RBA needs to keep that line that the problem is excess demand because if it starts admitting that inflation is more driven by supply-side factors and company profits then people might start to wonder why they increased interest rates so much. The governor also argued that while rate rises could not directly affect the prices of things like insurance and electricity, it was still worth raising rates because they ‚Äúgo into business costs‚Äù and that ‚Äútempers the ability of [businesses] to pass on costs‚Äù. Implicit in that line is that businesses can and have been passing on costs. And in doing so they have driven inflation. This is why the Allan Fels inquiry into price gouging and unfair pricing practices released on Tuesday remains extremely pertinent.   Related: Lack of competition allows supermarkets, banks and airlines to gouge Australians, report finds   The inquiry (to which I gave evidence in my role with the Centre for Future Work) found a decided lack of competition across a broad range of sectors including electricity, grocery retailing, banking, aviation, and early childhood education and care. Crucially for how the RBA goes about lowering inflation, the inquiry found that ‚Äúhigher interest rates only served to see the banks, led by Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank, NAB and ANZ increase their profit margins above long-term levels‚Äù. Fels also argues that companies have used ‚Äúbroader inflation trends as ‚Äòcover‚Äô to justify higher prices for their own products, even if their own production costs have not increased accordingly‚Äù. Perhaps when the RBA thinks about inflation, it might consider how much cover it gives to these companies when it continually says demand factors are the main reason rather than putting the spotlight on their pricing decisions. It might also ponder that the four major banks are laughing with glee every time the RBA decides to raise rates yet again, all in the interests of reducing supposedly excess demand. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 8 February 2024 to give the correct RBA GDP growth forecasts ‚Ä¢ Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

        "content": "This time last year there was speculation that the UK was set for a property market crash. The Bank of England was raising interest rates at every meeting of its monetary policy committee and interest from potential new buyers was fading fast. In the event, such fears have proved unfounded. Judging by the latest data from the lender Halifax, the Bank‚Äôs 14 increases in official borrowing costs had only a modest and temporary impact on prices. Prices rose by 1.3% in January, the biggest monthly increase since June 2022. No question, this has been one of the shortest and shallowest corrections on record. The Halifax house price index suggests the low point in the recent cycle came last summer, when prices were falling at an annual rate of about 5%. This was also the moment when the City was anticipating that interest rates would need to rise well above 6% to tame inflationary pressures. As it transpired, there has been no further tightening of policy from the Bank since it pushed borrowing costs to 5.25% in August last year, and house prices have now risen for four successive months, according to the Halifax. There are three main reasons why the market has turned so quickly. Firstly, lenders have anticipated lower official interest rates and have been offering competitive deals to attract business. The consultancy Capital Economics estimates that the average quoted home loan rate has come down from 5% in November 2023 to 4.5% in January 2024. Secondly, despite the flatlining of growth for the best part of the past two years there has been no increase in unemployment. Mass job losses were the big factor in explaining the much bigger declines in house prices in the early 1990s and the late 2000s. Finally, homes have become more affordable due to rising pay. Nominal annual earnings growth (unadjusted for prices) peaked at 9.3% last summer, a period when the fall in house prices was most pronounced. Houses are still expensive but not as expensive relative to earnings as they were. There are also structural reasons why house prices have a tendency to rise. Britain is a relatively small country, with a rising population, strict green belt regulations and a tax system that is generous to owner-occupiers. In the latest three months, the Halifax data shows annual house price inflation running at 10% or so. Even so, talk of a boom is probably premature, at least for now. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, says the fact the UK has avoided a property crash limits the scope for house price growth in the near term: ‚ÄúEven if the official Bank of England policy rate aligns with our expectation of a total of 125 basis points of cuts this year (1.25 percentage points), mortgage rates will remain significantly higher than for much of the last decade or so. As a result, we think this year will see house prices broadly flatline rather than stage a significant rebound.‚Äù"

Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister with responsibility for the Post Office, met in the morning with union officials as well as representatives from Britain‚Äôs co-operative movement. Sources described the discussion as ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù, amid reports ministers were considering rekindling a proposal to mutualise the service by shifting ownership to the branch managers who run the 11,500 Post Office outlets across the country. ‚ÄúMutualisation is certainly not off the table,‚Äù said Hollinrake, posting on X after the meeting. ‚ÄúBut as we have always said, any changes to the governance would need to take into account the costs and timing of the significant issues facing the Post Office, not least the compensation schemes and investment in the new IT system.‚Äù   The Post Office is an iconic institution, but we need to ensure it‚Äôs fit for the future.Today I met with the CWU National Postmasters and @voiceofthePM to constructively discuss how we can achieve this.Input from all involved was useful and I will now consider what we‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/MFMWm7Webo‚Äî Kevin Hollinrake MP (@kevinhollinrake) February 7, 2024  The meeting with the Department for Business and Trade could pave the way for the revival of a plan it supported in 2012, just before the business was separated from Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013. The decision was taken not to consider mutualisation until the Post Office, which remains government owned, was made more commercially sustainable. However, the possibility to revisit the model was enshrined in the 2011 Postal Services Act.‚Äù Those attending at the half-hour meeting on Wednesday included Sean Hudson, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) branch secretary for post office operators, Rose Marley, the chief executive of Co-operatives UK, and Richard Trinder, the chair of the Voice of the Postmaster, a campaign group. Andy Furey, a national officer at the CWU, said: ‚ÄúThere has to be a totally new operating model for the Post Office going forward to remain relevant for society. The toxic culture embedded for years [and] driven by senior management has failed. This means the people on the frontline delivering the service to communities on a daily basis deserve a much bigger say in the running of the Post Office.‚Äù Talks on the future of the Post Office come as a public inquiry into the scandal is likely to grill current and former executives over issues including governance when it reconvenes in April. Last week the government dismissed Henry Staunton as the Post Office chair, saying there was a ‚Äúneed for new leadership‚Äù. On Tuesday, MPs criticised the government for not acting over the Horizon IT scandal, even though it maintains a representative on the Post Office board with direct access to the governance and running of the company. The head of UK Government Investments (UKGI), the body responsible for managing the portfolio of wholly or partially state-owned companies such as NatWest and the Post Office, admitted the Post Office board needed to be questioned over its lack of ‚Äúcuriosity‚Äù about the scandal. Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office relentlessly pursued operators of sub-post offices across the UK for alleged theft, fraud and false accounting based on information from its Horizon IT system installed in the late 1990s. That was despite knowing that from at least 2010 onwards that there were faults in the centralised accounting software. In total, about 3,500 branch owner-operators were wrongly accused of taking money from their businesses, with more than 900 prosecuted by the Post Office despite protesting their innocence and raising issues with the software in their defence. The scandal, which caught the public attention after the broadcast of ITV‚Äôs drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, is frequently described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history."

January marked the fourth consecutive monthly rise, with a 1.3% uplift on December, the UK‚Äôs biggest mortgage lender said, with the average home costing ¬£291,000, ¬£3,900 more than in December. Kim Kinnaird, the director at Halifax Mortgages, said: ‚ÄúThe recent reduction of mortgage rates from lenders as competition picks up, alongside fading inflationary pressures and a still-resilient labour market has contributed to increased confidence among buyers and sellers. ‚ÄúThis has resulted in a positive start to 2024‚Äôs housing market.‚Äù The latest figures from Halifax come as other indicators show an improving outlook, with prices rising and increased activity. Last week, Nationwide said the outlook for the UK housing market was ‚Äúmore positive‚Äù after it reported a 0.7% jump in house prices in January. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported last month that new buyer inquiries had fallen by only 3% in December, which was a strong improvement on the 13% drop recorded in November. However, Halifax cautioned that while activity and prices had increased recently, interest rates remain elevated compared with historic lows seen in recent years, and demand continued to exceed supply. Kinnaird said: ‚ÄúLooking ahead, affordability challenges are likely to remain and further modest falls should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment.‚Äù The 2.5% annual increase was driven by areas outside the housing market hotspots of London and the south-east, which have continued to experience a correction in property prices. Northern Ireland recorded the strongest growth across all nations, with the average house price ¬£195,760, up 5.3% on last year. Scotland and Wales also experienced positive growth at 4% on an annual basis. Experts have suggested that the growth in prices in Northern Ireland is because of a weak supply of properties coming on to the market and a drop in the number of new homes being built. Prices in the south-east dropped by 2.3% year on year, while there was a 2% drop in the east of England, the south-west fell by 1.4% and London dropped by 0.4%. The average house price in London is just under ¬£530,000, ¬£150,000 higher than the south-east, the second most expensive place to buy."

Despite spending ¬£200m on new security measures, including additional guards and a roving undercover team targeting crime hotspots, the supermarket group suffered a 48% rise in shoplifting incidents to almost 298,000. Matt Hood, the managing director of the Co-op‚Äôs food business, said: ‚ÄúThis is not a few opportunistic shoplifters becoming more prolific. This is organised crime and looting.‚Äù He said that in some stores, staff face as many as two or three incidents a week of thieves jumping the till counter to steal alcohol, cigarettes and lottery cards. He said such stores were rendered unprofitable until new security measures, such as reinforced till kiosks with secure doors, were introduced. Hood said the Co-op was not using facial recognition systems, unlike a number of other major chains. He has joined other major retail bosses in calling for a new specific crime of attacking a retail worker as two-in-five of those detained by the chain‚Äôs guards still walk away as police had failed to attend an incident. ‚ÄúPeople who are really organised can only be stopped by custodial sentences and the police. We need it to have consequences,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe thing that concerns me more than anything is that we have colleagues who won‚Äôt bother to report [incidents] as they know they are not going to get a reaction. ‚ÄúIf you have detained somebody that has committed a crime and the police don‚Äôt turn up, you have to let them go. You can imagine how demotivating that is for people working in the shop and how motivating [it is] for shoplifters.‚Äù The Co-op has highlighted that where serious incidents are prioritised, and there is cooperation with the police, the problem can be tackled. Forces such as Essex, Nottinghamshire and Sussex last year worked with the Co-op to manage the arrest of 110 prolific offenders, leading to a combined 30 years of custodial sentences and a further 60 years‚Äô worth of criminal behaviour orders. In addition, 16 offenders received some form of rehabilitation order. Hood said: ‚ÄúUnless these crimes become something police act on, this will continue. It has been proved in Scotland that if you make it a specific crime to attack a shopworker, incidents come down. We need that to happen in England.‚Äù Labour proposed an amendment to the criminal justice bill currently working its way through parliament that would have made the assault of a retail worker a specific criminal offence, carrying a sentence of 12 months behind bars or a fine of up to ¬£10,000. The government voted against the move, with the policing minister, Chris Philp, saying it could lead to a problem of ‚Äúequity between retail workers and other public-facing workers‚Äù. Hood said he had seen ‚Äúearly signs of progress‚Äù from the government‚Äôs retail crime action plan published in October, which includes a police commitment to prioritise attending shoplifting instances involving violence against a shopworker or where security guards have detained an offender. The plan also involves the more controversial Project Pegasus under which 10 of the country‚Äôs biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Boots and Primark, are handing over CCTV images to the police, to be run through databases using facial recognition technology in an effort to identify prolific or potentially dangerous individuals. Some experts argue that technology such as self-checkouts and the display of expensive goods on shelves, rather than behind counters served by staff, have contributed to the problems."

        "content": "The UK‚Äôs biggest housebuilder, Barratt, has struck a deal to buy its smaller rival Redrow for more than ¬£2.5bn. The two companies have reached an agreement over an all-share offer from Barratt, which will cement its position as the country‚Äôs largest housebuilder. The merged group, to be called Barratt Redrow, is expected to build about 23,000 homes a year and have a turnover of more than ¬£7bn. The combined market value was ¬£7.2bn when financial markets closed on Tuesday. The deal is supported by both boards and by Steve Morgan, who started Redrow 50 years ago with a ¬£5,000 loan from his father after working on buildings sites. He still holds 16% of the shares. Morgan said Barratt was a company he had ‚Äúlong admired,‚Äù adding that the merger would create a ‚Äústandout builder‚Äù that would speed up the construction of much-needed homes. Barratt shareholders will retain 67.2% of the whole group leaving Redrow shareholders with 32.8%. The Redrow brand will be retained for marketing new homes and its Heritage collection, aimed at more affluent buyers, added to the portfolio, which also comprises Barratt‚Äôs more affordable David Wilson Homes. Barratt‚Äôs chief executive, David Thomas, who will lead the new group, said in some cases, all three brands could be on the same site, adding: ‚ÄúWe see the opportunity to expand Redrow‚Äôs geography.‚Äù Shareholders will vote on the deal in mid-May, which will also need approval from regulators. The companies hope the deal will be completed in the second half of the year. Last year, Morgan, a major donor to the Conservatives under Boris Johnson‚Äôs leadership, attacked the government for being ‚Äúso anti-house-building‚Äù in its proposals for planning reform. The deal comes as developers grapple with the biggest housing downturn since the financial crisis. Both companies reported sharp declines in output, revenue and profits but said sales had improved in the new year amid increasing mortgage approvals and reduced interest rates. Redrow‚Äôs pre-tax profit plunged by 58% to ¬£84m in the six months to 31 December, while Barratt‚Äôs was down by 81% to ¬£95.2m, partly because of a ¬£62m bill for building safety repairs to older homes. The RBC Capital Markets analyst Anthony Codling said: ‚ÄúHousebuilders are seeing the underlying housing market pick up and for those who are short of land into a recovering market, sometimes it is easier to buy a landbank than build one.‚Äù This is only the second acquisition by Barratt in the last 16 years after it bought Wilson Bowden for ¬£2.2bn in 2007, just before the financial crisis,making it the biggest housebuilder in the UK and giving it the David Wilson brand. The Redrow share price jumped by 13% to 674p on news of the deal, while Barratt shares fell by more than 7% to 491p. Redrow investors will receive 1.44 new Barratt shares for each Redrow share they own. This means Morgan‚Äôs stake is worth ¬£373m at the current Barratt share price, down from ¬£400m based on Tuesday‚Äôs closing share price of 530p. The Redrow chief executive, Matthew Pratt‚Äôs, stake is worth ¬£760,000, while the company‚Äôs chief financial officer, Barbara Richmond, owns shares worth more than ¬£4m. Pratt will stay on and run the Redrow business, while Richmond is staying for 12 months to oversee the integration. Caroline Silver, who chairs Barratt, will lead the combined board. Steve Hoey, the chief executive of the non-profit group Turning Lives Around and the chair of the Homelessness Prevention Forum, tweeted: ‚ÄúSurely this will be the biggest builder; will they build what we need?‚Äù Barratt is ahead of Vistry Group, completing 17,200 homes last year and posting profits of ¬£705m. Vistry, which uses the Bovis Homes, Linden Homes and Countryside Homes brands, completed 16,124 homes last year. Vistry bought Countryside for almost ¬£1.3bn in 2022. Redrow is the sixth-biggest builder, having completed 5,400 homes last year and reporting pre-tax profits of ¬£395m. The Investec analyst Aynsley Lammin said: ‚ÄúThe deal looks very sensible given the challenging planning and land backdrop, particularly assuming that sales rates and the profit outlook gradually improves from here. The all-share nature of the deal is astute, retaining a robust balance sheet.‚Äù The companies estimate cost savings of about ¬£90m a year in three years‚Äô time, from procurement savings and ‚Äúrationalisation of divisional and central functions‚Äù in the group. Site and sales office-based employees are not expected to be affected. Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the trading platform Interactive Investor, said: ‚ÄúThe move is a seismic shift for the sector, reflecting not only the challenges which housebuilders have more recently faced in terms of the economic backdrop, but also a move to shore up the capabilities of two major players.‚Äù"

        "content": "Scores of rural households have spent days without heating or hot water in subzero temperatures because of delays to their deliveries of liquid petroleum gas (LPG). About 200,000 UK homes, mostly in remote areas, rely on LPG because they are not connected to the gas network. However, some are reporting being left without fuel over Christmas, despite their accounts with their supplier being hundreds of pounds in credit.  Others were unable to heat their homes or cook food during the recent cold snap. Among those who contacted the Guardian were a couple in their late 70s who were forced to turn off their heating during January to conserve gas for cooking and a pensioner whose supply ran out in temperatures of ‚Äì3C. Both households are contracted to AvantiGas and said that they had been given no explanation or apology for the lack of fuel. Another AvantiGas customer, James Morrison, said his teenage son fell ill after the family spent seven days without heating in temperatures that reached -7C. ‚ÄúAvantiGas told us they‚Äôd mark us as urgent on the day our gas ran out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNothing happened. Two days later I called again and was told we could now be classed as ‚Äòextreme urgent‚Äô and that if [the tank] was found to be more than 10%, I would be charged ¬£280.‚Äù Verity Evans has been waiting for a delivery since mid-November and has been without heating, hot water or cooking facilities for a week.  ‚ÄúWe are on a telemetric contract with AvantiGas, which automatically triggers a delivery request when the level in the tank reaches 25%,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe called when we were down to 10% and Avanti told us they wouldn‚Äôt let us run out of gas. The gas ran out seven days ago and each time we call we‚Äôre told we‚Äôll be contacted within 72 hours. Our seven-year-old is asthmatic. We are desperate.‚Äù AvantiGas arranged a delivery to Morrison and the three pensioners when the Guardian raised their plight, but Evans is still waiting. The company said that ‚Äúever-changing factors‚Äù could cause delays, including vehicle breakdown, poor weather and ‚Äúroute efficiency‚Äù, but refused to confirm whether it was struggling to meet demand. It said that customers would only be notified the day before a delivery ‚Äúin order for us to remain as efficient as possible‚Äù. Dozens of customers contracted to other suppliers are reporting similar problems on review websites. Calor blamed technical issues at certain refineries for disruption to its delivery schedules, which have left some households without fuel. ‚ÄúDue to current high demand, recent poor weather and regional supply issues at some UK oil refineries, a small proportion of our customers have been impacted by late deliveries and in some cases run out of gas before we are able to reach them,‚Äù said a spokesperson. The UK‚Äôs 4 million off-grid households lack the legal protections granted to mainstream gas customers as the sector is unregulated. Customers can complain to UtilitiesADR if a complaint is unresolved after eight weeks, but that is too late for those with urgent supply issues. The energy regulator Ofgem, which has no remit over non-metered supplies, obliges utilities firms to keep a priority services register of vulnerable customers and to maintain their supply even if they are in debt. The trade association for LPG, Liquid Gas UK, requires its members to prioritise vulnerable customers if cold weather disrupts deliveries, but its customer charter is not legally binding. A spokesperson for Liquid Gas UK said: ‚ÄúOur members are working hard to reduce delays. Recent cold weather has caused a temporary increase in demand for LPG across the UK, at a time when the sector is also addressing short-term supply and logistical challenges, including a reduction in product availability from UK refineries.‚Äù"

        "content": "Qantas‚Äô decision to reduce its domestic flight capacity and increase air fares in 2022 may have contributed to inflation and led the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, a union inquiry into price gouging has found. Former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair Allan Fels, who led the Australian Council of Trade Unions‚Äô commissioned inquiry, was scathing of the effects a lack of competition in aviation was having on consumers. ‚ÄúThe duopoly in the aviation sector in Australia is dominated by Qantas and there is price gouging by Qantas,‚Äù he said. Fels found that in 2022, when Australia‚Äôs freshly reopened internal and international borders triggered a surge in travel demand, airlines were responding to high fuel prices related to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and made decisions that rippled through the economy.  Sign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  In May 2022, Qantas cut its domestic capacity by 10%, Fels noted.In an announcement to the ASX in June, the airline said it was ‚Äúadjusting its domestic capacity levels for much of FY23 to assist with the recovery of sustained high fuel prices‚Äù. The airline cut capacity a further 5% in July and August, Fels said, followed by another planned cut of 10% in October. ‚ÄúQantas said at the time that ‚Äòthe customer impacts from these schedule changes are expected to be minimal, with capacity being removed mostly from high frequency routes‚Äô,‚Äù Fels said.   Related: Virgin should get rights to extra Bali flights over Jetstar, Transport Workers Union says   In 2022, the ACCC warned airlines against deliberately slowing their return to full service capacity so they could ‚Äúkeep air fares high‚Äù. Government data from the time found cheapest available return domestic air fares were at levels not recorded since March 2004. In December 2022, average return air fares between Sydney and Melbourne on budget carriers averaged $500. Australians facing the high air fares turned to overnight trains and coaches as cheaper interstate travel options, with services selling out. Qantas would go on to post a record $2.47bn profit for 2022-23. On Wednesday, Fels‚Äô report found that airlines‚Äô reduction in supply at a time of Australians‚Äô increasing appetite for domestic travel may have had an inflationary impact. ‚ÄúQantas‚Äô ability to reduce supply while increasing prices and suffering no material loss of market share, may have affected CPI (inflation) in December 2022, and therefore may have impacted the Reserve Bank‚Äôs inflation expectations and rate increases,‚Äù Fels said. ‚ÄúQantas fare increases over the three months to December 2022 were large enough to produce a sizable increase in the ‚Äòholiday travel and accommodation‚Äô contribution to inflation,‚Äù Fels saidFels found that Qantas‚Äô fare increases possibly accounted for up to 25% of that category‚Äôs increase in the December quarter as it appeared in the ABS CPI measure. That quarter, the ABS identified the recreation and culture category, which includes domestic and international travel, as the group that contributed the most to inflation. ‚ÄúA quarter of [that category‚Äôs] inflation that month was mainly due to Qantas aggressively raising air fares although Virgin may have also contributed,‚Äù Fels said. At the beginning of 2022, interest rates were 0.1%. In May 2022, the Reserve Bank raised the rate by 0.25%, setting off a run that saw it rise to 3.85% by May 2023. In a statement, Qantas said ‚Äúthe temporary spike in fares post-Covid reflected reductions in capacity to improve operational resilience following the challenging restart of the industry once borders opened‚Äù. ‚ÄúThese reductions coincided with a period of high demand and the imbalance pushed up fares across all airlines. At the same time, fuel prices increased by more than 60%, driving fares higher again,‚Äù Qantas said. Virgin was approached for comment. Fels also noted that throughout 2022, rates of cancellations and flight disruptions soared to record highs, as airlines struggled to return to pre-Covid operations due in part to shortages of staff who had left the industry during the pandemic, Covid waves and strong demand. In 2017-19, Qantas‚Äô cancellation rate was 2%, which increased to 4.4% in 2022-23, Fels said, noting a similar increase in Virgin‚Äôs disruptions. ‚ÄúQantas‚Äô service delivery returning from the pandemic shut down became so derided the term ‚ÄòJoyced‚Äô (a reference to then CEO Alan Joyce) entered into popular Australian usage to ‚Äòdescribe being severely inconvenienced at an airport by flight cancellations or luggage going astray‚Äô,‚Äù Fels said. Fels also noted how the Albanese government‚Äôs controversial decision to reject Qatar Airways‚Äô push to almost double its flights to Australia kept international air fares higher. ‚ÄúQuite clearly it was acting in the interests of Qantas,‚Äù Fels said of the government."

        "content": "Britain‚Äôs poorest households have suffered a ¬£4,500 hit to their finances since the start of the Covid pandemic, according to a report indicating that those on the lowest incomes have borne the brunt of the cost of living crisis. Highlighting a dramatic fall in living standards since Boris Johnson‚Äôs election landslide four years ago, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank said soaring costs for energy, food and other basic essentials had hit those most badly off the hardest. For the poorest half of households in Britain, it said living standards would be as much as 20% lower this year compared with 2019-20, after taking account of inflation, and would not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2027. The intervention comes after the payment of the government‚Äôs final ¬£299 cost of living support instalment for 8 million people on means-tested benefits this week, in the last of three payouts worth ¬£900 in total. However, NIESR warned the support remained insufficient to overcome the hit to living standards inflicted when the easing of Covid restrictions and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine drove up inflation at the fastest rate in four decades. The thinktank said living standards for the poorest tenth of families, after adjusting for inflation, remained 18% below 2019-20 levels even after accounting for government support ‚Äì delivering a financial blow worth ¬£4,500 in today‚Äôs prices. ‚ÄúAs a proportion of their budget, they spend a lot more on energy, food and housing [than wealthier households], so they took more of the brunt of the shock,‚Äù said Adrian Pabst, NIESR‚Äôs deputy director for public policy. ‚ÄúThere are deep-scarring effects from these cumulative shocks, and that is despite welcome and significant policy intervention,‚Äù he added. NIESR‚Äôs news comes after Rishi Sunak claimed in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday that the burden on households was ‚Äústarting to ease‚Äù after a fall in inflation from more than 10% a year ago to 4% in December. Falling inflation does not mean prices are coming down, only that they are rising less quickly. In its latest quarterly health check on the economy, NIESR forecast that inflation would drop to as low as 1.2% by the spring, which could spur the Bank of England to cut interest rates from as early as May. Threadneedle Street has a target set by the government to steer inflation towards 2%. A combination of lower inflation and sustained wage growth should mean British households ‚Äústart to feel better off‚Äù this year, the thinktank said, forecasting a rise in living standards of about 1.5% on average over the next two years. However, it warned this masked stark differences between different households and parts of the country. ‚ÄúWith low economic growth and high costs of energy, food and housing, living standards are recovering slowly and not returning to pre-pandemic levels for another three years,‚Äù Pabst said. After more than a decade of wage stagnation for workers, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre basically talking about 15-20 years of no real improvement in living standards‚Äù since the 2008 financial crisis, he added. The thinktank, which is Britain‚Äôs oldest independent research institute, said the priority for the government ahead of the general election would be to boost spending on infrastructure, rather than tax cuts. Stephen Millard, NIESR‚Äôs deputy director for macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, said he expected the government to use improvements in the strength of public finances for tax cuts. ‚ÄúHopefully, our message has come across that we would not be overly thrilled about that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is a desperate need for increased public and private investment if higher growth is to be restored.‚Äù A Treasury spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAs this report acknowledges, the UK economy is beginning to turn a corner thanks to the decisive action we‚Äôve taken to tackle high inflation. ‚ÄúBut we know the job isn‚Äôt done, which is why we‚Äôve supported households with ¬£3,700 between 2022 and 2025. Wages have been rising faster than prices for the last five months, millions of low-paid workers will get a record increase through the national living wage from April and the average worker will save ¬£450 this year thanks to our national insurance cut last month.‚Äù"

It released photographic evidence alongside the preliminary findings of its investigation on Tuesday.\nBoeing has tried to reassure regulators, airlines and passengers following the dramatic incident during an Alaska Airlines flight, which prompted 171 Max 9 jets to be grounded for several weeks. \nThe NTSB said the four bolts were removed while workers repaired damaged rivets last year at Boeing‚Äôs facility in Renton, Washington. A photo taken during the work shows at least three of the bolts had not been replaced, with the location of the fourth obscured.\nThe agency is still investigating ‚Äúwhat manufacturing documents were used to authorize the opening and closing‚Äù of the plug ‚Äúduring the rivet rework‚Äù, according to its report.\nIn a statement, Boeing boss Dave Calhoun said: ‚ÄúWhatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.

        "content": "Five years after his infamous ousting from the co-working company he founded, Adam Neumann is trying to buy back WeWork. Lawyers representing Neumann‚Äôs new venture, Flow Global, sent a letter to WeWork advisers on Monday revealing he has been trying to meet with the company for months to negotiate a deal to buy back the company or provide it with debt financing.   Related: The dizzying rise, and even more vertiginous fall, of WeWork   But WeWork advisers have appeared hesitant to go to the negotiating table with the company‚Äôs former CEO. Neumann‚Äôs lawyers said that WeWork had had a ‚Äúlack of engagement‚Äù with him and had not given the information he needs to make an offer to purchase the company or finance its debt. The company has more than $4bn in debt, according to the New York Times, which first reported on the potential deal. The letter noted that WeWork had shut out Neumann from deals before. When Neumann tried to ‚Äúarrange up to $1bn of financing to stabilize WeWork in October 2022‚Äù, the company‚Äôs then CEO, Sandeep Mathrani, ‚Äúshut down that process without explanation‚Äù while ‚Äúparticipants were literally in the air traveling‚Äù. Neumann, once the prophetic leader of the company he co-founded in 2010, was pushed out in 2019 after WeWork failed to get on to the US stock market. With leverage as a major company shareholder, Neumann was able to negotiate an exit package worth nearly half a billion, with $245m in company stock and $200m in cash to leave the company. After the fallout, details of Neumann‚Äôs chaotic leadership were revealed and eventually dramatized for Hollywood in the 2022 Hulu miniseries ‚ÄúWeCrashed‚Äù. In the years since WeWork‚Äôs 2019 collapse, the company ‚Äì once valued at $47bn ‚Äì has continued to struggle. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November as interest rates rose and demand for office space declined with more workers choosing to work from home. The company is facing frustration from its landlords, who have taken the company to court over doubts about its stability. One of the company‚Äôs major creditors is SoftBank, the Japanese investment company that had pumped cash into Neumann‚Äôs vision of WeWork before its collapse. Since he left WeWork, Neumann has returned to leadership, creating a new company focused on the residential real estate market. Flow Global received a huge $350m check from the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz in 2022 to scale up Neumann‚Äôs idea of branded apartments. Think WeWork, but for renters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often under-appreciated that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office experience and led a paradigm-changing global company in the process,‚Äù Marc Andreessen, of the venture capital firm, wrote in a blogpost in 2022. ‚ÄúFor Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty.‚Äù In his efforts to get WeWork back, Neumann has the help of the hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb, according to the New York Times, whose investment firm Third Point is known for taking over ailing companies. Neumann‚Äôs lawyers, in their letter to WeWork, painted a brief picture of what he has in mind if WeWork gets back under his control. ‚ÄúIn a hybrid work world where demand for WeWork‚Äôs product should be greater than ever, my clients believe that the synergies and management expertise offered by an acquisition could significantly exceed the value of the debtors on a stand-alone basis,‚Äù the lawyers wrote. ‚ÄúWeWork should at least educate itself about that potential and not preclude itself from maximizing value.‚Äù In a statement, WeWork told the Guardian that it received ‚Äúexpressions of interest from external parties on a regular basis‚Äù and reviewed them ‚Äúwith a view to acting in the best interests of the company‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe continue to believe that the work we are currently doing ‚Äì undressing our unsustainable rent expenses and restructuring our business ‚Äì will ensure WeWork is best positioned as an independent, valuable, financially strong and sustainable company long into the future,‚Äù the statement read."

        "content": "The new president of the Confederation of British Industry has admitted that the Guardian‚Äôs revelations about sexual misconduct at the lobbying group were ‚Äúan appalling shock‚Äù that tipped it into a ‚Äúnear-death experience‚Äù. Rupert Soames said the scandal had triggered an existential crisis, from which he is trying to rescue the organisation. The group has lost almost a third of its staff after an exodus of fee-paying members last April left it desperately short of funds. Companies including BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Tesco Sainsbury‚Äôs and Aviva quit or suspended their membership in the wake of allegations that spanned harassment, drug taking, and assault and rape of CBI staff by their own colleagues. ‚ÄúIt has had an appalling shock, a near-death experience,‚Äù Soames said. ‚ÄúThis has been a disaster for individuals. It has caused a lot of pain. It has seriously harmed what is an important institution in the UK.‚Äù Soames, who revived the outsourcing company Serco after its own near-death experience, was unable to rule out further redundancies at the CBI‚Äôs central London head office. ‚ÄúI am diligently working really hard to persuade people to come back and come back fast because if they come back fast we can be bigger, stronger and wiser. If they come back slowly we‚Äôre going to have to make sure that our income and our expenditure meet each other.‚Äù He said he was convinced there was still a place for the CBI and that ‚ÄúBritain needs it‚Äù, citing the recent return of the big four accountancy firm PwC as a member. ‚ÄúThere are some people who are really putting their shoulder to the wheel and saying we need this organisation. It‚Äôs the only one that can speak. Nobody else has stepped into the role and we‚Äôre in a bloody general election year,‚Äù he said. Soames, a grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, said he was persuaded to take on the unpaid role to help revive the UK‚Äôs flagging economy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be a national effort to focus on getting the UK economy into a state where it can compete and grow and help productivity, prosperity. I would love to have a walk-on part in that,‚Äù he said. He admitted there were uncertainties surrounding the CBI‚Äôs finances. ‚ÄúYour job is secure so long as we can get the revenue to pay for it. Full stop. If not, we will have to cut our cloth,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt no particular secret about it.‚Äù The CBI is surviving thanks in part to additional funding from a small clutch of members, including banks. Exploratory talks about a merger with the manufacturing body MakeUK collapsed amid a dispute over pension liabilities. After the Guardian‚Äôs investigation revealed the scale and breadth of concerns among present and former staff, the CBI hired the law firm Fox Williams to carry out an investigation. It found evidence of a toxic culture, for which its then president, Brian McBride, publicly apologised. Its director general Tony Danker had already been dismissed by the board after the Guardian revealed unrelated complaints about his conduct in March. The CBI settled with Danker for an undisclosed sum this week and reiterated that his departure was unrelated to the other allegations. Soames said businesses that thought that they no longer needed the CBI would find that the next government would ‚Äúcampaign in poetry and govern in prose‚Äù, with detailed policy proposals likely to be unveiled only after the election. He said bosses may find their access to politicians such as Rachel Reeves, currently the shadow chancellor, limited if and when they enter government, making a unifying voice such as the CBI‚Äôs all the more important. ‚ÄúI would say to those CEOs: ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, were she to be in government, you‚Äôll find her somewhat less available.‚Äù Still, he said, the CBI must avoid the ‚Äúcomplacency‚Äù of its past, when it was ‚Äúnot very good at communicating what it did‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere is an opportunity here to rethink: what is the point?‚Äù he said. Members and returning members could also take comfort in the knowledge that managers were now better trained and highly committed at the body, he said, as part of its wider effort to reform in the wake of the misconduct scandal. ‚ÄúBritain needs a CBI and that‚Äôs one of the reasons I came here, because we need a voice that speaks across business that I don‚Äôt think anybody else can completely do.‚Äù Soames claimed that the CBI could make a difference by ensuring that the UK reclaimed a leading role in global business regulation and by modernising red tape. This effort could help Britain manage what Soames said was a ‚Äúgreat disruption‚Äù after Brexit and Covid. He said that since 2000 the UK‚Äôs growth had been ‚Äúrelatively poor compared to nearly all of our competitors ... Life for most businesses has been hellish since 2016.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy personal belief is that the next five years are going to be really determinative about how the UK does probably for the next generation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be able to outspend our competitors and peers, but we may be able to outsmart them. Smart means a closer coordination between business and government.‚Äù"

        "content": "If in doubt, throw cash at the shareholders. It‚Äôs a safe tactic for a new chief executive assailed on two sides by investors with conflicting grumbles. BP‚Äôs Murray Auchincloss seized his debut moment. There will be $3.5bn of share buy-backs in the first half of this year, accelerating to a total of $14bn by the end of next. The shares rose 5%. For a week or two, that might stop people pointing out how BP‚Äôs share price has lagged its peers‚Äô. Yet shareholders of all hues ‚Äì those who want to transition faster out of fossil fuels and those who can‚Äôt see the point ‚Äì surely also wanted to hear a clear statement from Auchincloss on where he stands in the great debate. How will BP prioritise its spending of cash that isn‚Äôt going on buy-backs and dividends? Does the BP CEO intend to stick rigidly to his predecessor, Bernard Looney‚Äôs, pursuit of net zero by 2050, a plan that included a cut of 25% in oil and gas production by 2030 against 2019 levels, accompanied by a ramp-up in spending in renewables and other ‚Äútransition growth engines‚Äù in BP-speak? Or does he feel obliged to throw red meat to the lobby, now led by the small but influential hedge fund Bluebell Capital Partners, that says BP should stick to what it knows and leave the building of windfarms to specialists? Auchincloss fudged it. ‚ÄúWe will pragmatically adapt to what‚Äôs happening with demand in society,‚Äù he said, saying BP would go for the ‚Äúhighest return and highest value projects‚Äù. What does that mean? Well, ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù in the mouth of a chief executive of a large oil company is often code for oilier than previously advertised. That is especially so when there‚Äôs a reference to the pace at which society is moving ‚Äì a line used by Shell‚Äôs boss, Wael Sawan, to justify diluting green targets last year. On the other hand, Auchincloss also played the continuity card. ‚ÄúOur destination remains unchanged‚Äù, he said, arguing BP still wanted to be an integrated energy company rather than an international oil company. Not all high-value projects, he seemed to imply, involve fossil fuels. There was something for everyone, in other words. Those shareholders who protested a year ago about Looney cutting the oil and gas reduction target from 40% can console themselves that his successor hasn‚Äôt explicitly moved the dial further (he just talked about ‚Äúaims‚Äù for 2030 rather than a ‚Äútarget‚Äù). And the Bluebellists can seize on the comments about ‚Äúpragmatism‚Äù and think BP can be bounced into taking a more roundabout route to Auchincloss‚Äôs supposedly unchanged destination. One can see why a new boss, even one who was the old finance director, might opt for ambiguity. When BP can actually show, rather than talk about, double-digit returns on capital from its investments in wind, solar, hydrogen and electric vehicle charging points, he will be in a stronger position. Yet it‚Äôs hard to avoid the conclusion that absolute clarity would be a better approach when a debate over strategy is raging outside. This column‚Äôs view is that BP should be given time, which means at least a couple of years, to prove that decent returns can be generated outside fossil fuels. And since the plan imagines that three-quarters of earnings will still be coming from hydrocarbons in 2030, it is hardly a case of green evangelism in action. But, quite obviously, not everyone agrees. The stick-to-what-you-know activists are getting louder. Rather than muddying the waters by hinting at tweaks and adjustments, Auchincloss should be braver. Say what you believe."

A major contributor to the company‚Äôs demise is the corporate governance framework within which it operated: a group structure with diversified and disengaged shareholders, a dominant boardroom presiding over an ineffective remuneration committee, and stakeholder engagement that failed to take account of the competing interests of different constituent groups, with little regard for the impact of the demands made of employees. Sadly, the UK appears to take pride in its liberal regulatory corporate governance framework, which ensures that shareholder value is the guiding force. This has resulted in a board that has destroyed trust, a shareholder body content to accept financial returns without holding the board to account for fundamental failings, and a workforce that has been treated with contempt. Prof Charlotte VilliersUniversity of Bristol Law School ‚Ä¢ How depressingly brilliant is Aditya Chakrabortty‚Äôs description of the decline of Royal Mail. To be part of a society in decline is dispiriting. Our reaction to a situation that seemingly can‚Äôt be changed is to accept it with resignation, as he describes. If we try to understand why our situation doesn‚Äôt change, we might look at the people who are doing well out of it ‚Äì the small group who have been enriched rather than impoverished by all that has happened in recent decades. They don‚Äôt want it to change. and their wealth can go a long way to ensuring that it won‚Äôt. Can the knowledge that, for example, Royal Mail shareholders have received ¬£2bn in payouts in the past 10 years, while we have endured the loss of a reliable service, empower us? Only if we have political leaders who can overcome their fear of the rich and powerful. Knowledge alone is, sadly, not enough. But it is a start. Jeanne WarrenGarsington, Oxfordshire ‚Ä¢ Aditya Chakrabortty‚Äôs piece makes depressing reading. What we need to know is how a business with royal in the title is allowed to fall into private hands when we live in a constitutional monarchy? We pay for the royals and they put their title to national institutions. Our king has his image on stamps to endorse the service.

Between 2008 and 2009, it cost the government ¬£45.5 billion to bail out the then Royal Bank of Scotland. This was at an average of 520p per share, much higher than the current price.

Bim Afolami, economic secretary to the Treasury of the United Kingdom, doesn‚Äôt make any promises. Afolami explains that the share sale plan is subject to ‚Äúvalue for money concerns‚Äù and adds:  Of course, we will consider value for money at the heart of any sale of shares, and the House [of Commons] will be kept fully informed over the coming weeks and months.  NatWest shares are currently trading at 219p each. That‚Äôs rather lower than a year ago. In May 2023, NatWest agreed to buy ¬£1.3bn of its own shares back from the governmen at 268.4p each. The government seems certain to make a paper loss on NatWest share sales, as it paid 500p each for them in 2008 when it rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (later rebranded as NatWest).

Some 45,649 new homes were completed in the rental and affordable sector, up 10% on 2022 and the highest figure ever recorded by the National House Building Council, the UK‚Äôs largest provider of new home warranties and insurance. Overall, 133,213 new homes were completed in 2023, down 12% on 2022, with private sector completions falling 20% to 87,564. The outlook doesn‚Äôt look too rosy. Last year, there was a 44% drop in new home registrations ‚Äì the process by which a developer registers their intent to build a new home - to 105,449. Across the UK, all regions saw a fall in registrations, with the biggest declines in the North West (-61%), West Midlands (-59%) and East (-52%). Steve Wood, CEO at NHBC, said:  ‚ÄúWhilst there were considerable supply and demand pressures on the new homes market in 2023, it is very encouraging to see record numbers of new home completions in the affordable sector. Several major house builders have partnered with housing associations and Build to Rent providers, re-focusing parts of their output to help address the demand for affordable homes. ‚ÄúThe backdrop of high interest rates, significant inflationary pressures and challenges with planning consents has supressed private sale output in 2023. That said, there are some signs of demand returning to the market and we would expect an improved position in 2024 as consumer confidence begins to recover and mortgage rates start to fall.‚Äù  Looking to the year ahead, Wood added:  ‚ÄúWith a general election looming, we may also see new home-buyer incentives that influence build volumes.

When pressed on the value of the UK‚Äôs stake in Eutelsat, Donald indicated ‚Äúit could be in excess of ¬£200m‚Äù. He also pointed out that Eutselsat withgrew its guidance for this year‚Äôs profitability and revenues last week, which knocked its share price. But Donald insisted the shareholding in Eutelsat has a different longterm prospect than the original shareholding in OneWeb. Harriett Baldwin MP, chair of the committee, was unimpressed, asking:  ‚ÄúSo effectively the UK taxpayer has paid ¬£400m for some intellectual property that now resides within a French company. And we‚Äôve lost money on the transaction?‚Äù  Eutelsat currently has a market capitalisation of ‚Ç¨1.75bn, meaning the UK‚Äôs 10.89% stake would be worth ‚Ç¨190m, or ¬£162m. Last week, it revealed that OneWeb‚Äôs activities are ‚Äúrunning behind schedule relative to the original roadmap‚Äù, although also ‚Äúprogressing well‚Äù. OneWeb is building a ‚Äúconstellation‚Äù of hundreds of satellites in low-earth orbits designed to provide internet coverage everywhere on the plane. Donald told MPs that UKGI assessed the ¬£400m investment in OneWeb, and was ‚Äúnot in a position to confirm‚Äù it was good value for money.

Updated at 11.47am GMT    10.48am GMT   NatWest is currently being run by Paul Thwaite, who was appointed as interim CEO after the resignation of Alison Rose last summer in the Nigel Farage debanking row. Charles Donald, chief executive of UK Government Investments, was asked by the Treasury Committee this morning if it would be ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù to sell the public shares in a bank that didn‚Äôt have a chief executive. Donald replied that NatWest should provide ‚Äòclarity‚Äô about its leadership plans before the retail sale offering is launched. Donald explained:  I think they need to provide clarity to the market on their proposals around either confirming the interim chief executive, or a process around appointing a permanent chief executive, for the market to be comfortable, yes.

Holger Vieten, who is leading the sale for the Treasury-owned company, told a group of MPs that there are some potential windows in which the share offering could take place. ‚ÄúThe very earliest could be around summertime, but we don‚Äôt have a exact date‚Äù, Vieten indicated. ‚ÄúPotentially it could happen in June‚Äù.

Total employment numbers fell fractionally, while sub-contractor usage was broadly unchanged since the previous month. Brian Smith, head of cost management and commercial at global infrastructure consultancy AECOM, says shrinking workforces will hit future output:  ‚ÄúConstruction output has continued to struggle throughout the winter, with five months of contraction. Wet weather can be partially attributed to some of the recent fall in activity, but the greater concern is the high inflation and tight credit conditions that continue to hamper housebuilding and are beginning to be felt in commercial development. ‚ÄúThese latest figures will hopefully provide greater ambition when it comes to the sector‚Äôs long-term approach to resourcing, which represents a growing risk. Reducing workforce capacity in response to broader economic headwinds will ultimately impact future planning and projects at a time when competition for contracts is increasing.‚Äù   Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.45am GMT  Interest rate cut hopes boost UK builders' optimism  Optimism in the UK construction sector has hit a two-year high, despite subdued order books and another fall in housebuilding. The latest poll of purchasing managers at building firms has found a sharp upturn in business activity expectations, due to hopes of interest rate cuts. Just over half of those surveyed forecast a rise in business activity during the year ahead, while only 12% predict a decline ‚Äì the highest level of business optimism since January 2022. Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey said:  ‚ÄúUK construction companies seem increasingly optimistic that the worst could be behind them soon as recession risks fade and interest rate cuts appear close on the horizon. The prospect of looser financial conditions and an improving economic backdrop meant that business activity expectations strengthened to the highest for two years in January. Moreover, there were again signs that customer demand is close to turning a corner as total new orders fell to the smallest extent for six months.  However, the survey also showed that construction activity fell in January, for the 5th month in a row. The increase in business confidence lifted the UK construction PMI up to 48.8 in January, from 46.8 in December, but still below the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. House-building remained by far the weakest-performing category, while civil engineering and commercial construction work also fell.  UK construction activity fell in all 3 sectors that the PMI cover (housing, civil engineering & commercial) although the falls in civil engineering & commercial were marginal whilst there was another sharp decline in housing, unsurprisingly.

Updated at 9.16am GMT    8.04am GMT   BP has a ricky balancing act ahead, says John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin:  BP has beaten expectations for the final quarter of 2023, but fallen slightly short for the year. The company went through a significant amount of change last year and this, combined with a declining oil price, has had an impact on overall performance.  Nevertheless, BP is still in resilient shape ‚Äì surplus cashflow remains positive, net debt has fallen, and the management team‚Äôs optimism can be seen in the 10% increase in dividend distributions. Questions have been raised over its future direction and BP will need to strike a tricky balance of continuing to invest in its core energy business to deliver returns in the short term, while maintaining its long-term transformation.‚Äù      8.03am GMT  BP shares jump  Shares in BP have jumped almost 5% at the start of trading in London. They‚Äôre up 21p to 475p, a one-month high.     8.00am GMT   January was a harsh reality check for the retail sector, reports Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, as shown by like-for-like sales growth falling from 1.9% in December to 1.4% last month.  The excitement of Christmas quickly faded with consumers tightening their purse strings to mark the beginning of a new year and the end of the festive splurge. While 2024 may be the year that interest rate cuts kick in and real incomes grow, consumers are still grappling with much higher prices than they were a few years ago and higher mortgage payments on top. That‚Äôs leading to lower consumer confidence and less spending in the economy including on discretionary retail items. A two-speed retail sector has been emerging, separating the winners from the losers in the UK with luxury and certain discretionary retailers struggling amid the macroeconomic headwinds while supermarkets like Tesco continue to thrive despite intense price competition. Looking ahead, the threat of supply chain disruptions, product delays and shortages following the attacks in the Red Sea is an overhang to watch for the sector.‚Äù   Updated at 8.01am GMT    7.49am GMT   BP delivered a ‚Äústrong‚Äù underlying financial performance in 2023, insists CFO Kate Thomson. Thomson explains:  We raised dividend per ordinary share by 10% and bought back $7.9bn of shares. We remain focused on strengthening the balance sheet, with net debt falling to $20.9bn, the lowest level over the past decade. As we look forward, we are staying disciplined, tightening our capital expenditure frame and simplifying and enhancing our share buyback guidance through 2025.       7.47am GMT   Mathew Lawrence, director of the thinktank Common Wealth, says BP‚Äôs financial results show Big Oil cannot be trusted to deliver a clean energy future.  Lawrence  The fossil fuel giants cannot unhook themselves from their planet-destroying business model.  Doubling down on oil and gas investment guarantees deepening climate crisis and volatile, eye-watering energy bills. And while the sums for renewables investment are pitiful, they have still found billions to reward their investors.  Damaging as these outcomes are, they are the inevitable outcome of their climate-hostile business model. Real change requires ending the primacy of the for-profit model in who ‚Äì and how ‚Äì we organise the energy transition.‚Äù      7.45am GMT  BP's share buybacks criticised  BP says it plans to make share buybacks of at least $14bn by the end of 2025, as part of its policy of returning at least 80% of surplus cash flow to shareholders. That implies quarterly buybacks of at least $1.75bn, up from the $1.5bn in the final quarter of 2023. Share buybacks are a way of returning cash to investors ‚Äì it pushes up the share price, and means dividends can be higher as the pot is split between a smaller number of shares. But they‚Äôre also controversial ‚Äì surely BP could find a better use for the money? Joseph Evans, researcher at IPPR, says:  ‚ÄúBP has decided to prioritise its shareholders over investing in the green transition. With profits down on last year, you might expect BP‚Äôs executives to be looking for profitable investments in the growing industries of the future, like renewable energy. Instead, they‚Äôve chosen to enrich their investors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that BP and other fossil-fuel giants can‚Äôt be trusted to drive the green transition: they will always prioritise their shareholders over the needs of the economy and the planet. What we need now is a large programme of public investment in renewables and net zero. The government could fund that investment by taxing the excessive pay-outs that BP and other energy giants are handing to their shareholders.‚Äù  Global Witness report that BP‚Äôs shareholder payouts rose to ¬£10.2bn last year. Jonathan Noronha-Gant, Global Witness senior campaigner, says BP‚Äôs shareholders remain among the biggest winners of Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine (which pushed up oil and gas prices in 2022).  ‚ÄúShareholders should want to protect their long-term positions. That means demanding a rapid clean energy transition for companies like BP. These reckless shareholder pay-outs do the opposite.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs millions of struggling households begin to receive their cost-of-living payments today, BP‚Äôs shareholders, in contrast, celebrate with an eye-watering payout. BP is making huge profits off the back of a cost-of-living and energy crisis that has devastated the finances of so many in the UK and around the globe.‚Äù   Updated at 8.04am GMT    7.38am GMT   BP‚Äôs drop in profits was partly due to weaker refining profit margins. The company says there were ‚Äúsignificantly lower industry refining margins‚Äù in the last quarter, due to narrowing prices for North American heavy crude oil differentials.     7.28am GMT  BP beats profit forecasts  Oil giant BP has beaten profit forecasts this morning, despite a drop in earnings. BP made adjusted earnings of almost $3bn in the final quarter of 2023, ahead of expectations of $2.76bn, but down on the $4.8bn profits made in Q4 2022 when energy prices were higher. For the full year, BP‚Äôs profits roughly halved to $13.8bn from $27.6bn in 2022. BP will continue to pump money back to shareholders; it has announced a new $1.75bn share buyback ‚Äì larger than the $1.5bn it executed in the last quarter ‚Äì and is committed to $3.5bn worth of buybacks for the first half of this year.

Auchincloss explains:  Looking back, 2023 was a year of strong operational performance with real momentum in delivery right across the business. And as we look ahead, our destination remains unchanged - from IOC to IEC - focused on growing the value of bp. We are confident in our strategy, on delivering as a simpler, more focused and higher-value company, and committed to growing long-term value for our shareholders.  Looking back, 2023 was also the year in which Auchincloss took on the top job at BP, after former CEO Bernard Looney failed to fully report details of relationships with colleagues.

UK retailers struggled through January as cost of living pressures continued to hit consumers. Spending in the shops rose by just 1.2% year-on-year in January, a sharp slowdown on the 4.2% recorded in January 2023, new data from the British Retail Consortium shows. With inflation running at 4% in December, that indicates a drop in sales volumes. The BRC also reports that people cut back on non-food items, with spending falling by 1.8% in the three months to January Food sales increased 6.3% year on year over the three months to January, slower than the 8% growth in January 2023. Helen Dickinson OBE, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says:  ‚ÄúEasing inflation and weak consumer demand led retail sales growth to slow. While the January sales helped to boost spending in the first two weeks, this did not sustain throughout the month. Larger purchases, such as furniture, household appliances, and electricals, remained weak as the higher cost of living continued into its third year.  Households on low incomes will start to receive a ¬£299 cost-of-living payment today ‚Äì the last of three payments totalling up to ¬£900 paid to eligible households on means-tested benefits over 2023/24. Separate figures from Barclays this morning have confirmed spending was weak last month: consumer card spending grew 3.1% year on year in January ‚Äì below the current headline rate of inflation of 4%.

        "content": " The outsourcing company Capita has become the second high-profile business to inform employees it would be dropping its commitment to the real living wage. The independently calculated rate, born out of a grassroots campaign to improve the lives of the UK‚Äôs poorest citizens, is meant to ensure the lowest-paid can afford the basic necessities of a decent life. But after two years of 10% increases, as inflation ripped through the economy, Capita has joined the brewer and bar operator BrewDog in telling staff it could no longer afford to pay the real living wage, which increased to ¬£12 an hour. Unions fear more companies may be preparing to follow.   Related: BrewDog faces staff backlash after dropping real living wage pledge   At Capita, the Communications Workers Union (CWU), which represents many of the staff ‚Äì who work on contracts for a range of customers including Virgin Media and Tesco Mobile ‚Äì is consulting its members about the next steps. Tracey Fossey of the CWU said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad: these are the lowest earners and it makes a big difference to them. Capita are saying that they can‚Äôt continue it: that they don‚Äôt have the funds to support it ‚Äì which we don‚Äôt agree with, when the CEO can take home more than ¬£1.7m in 2022.‚Äù A spokesperson for Capita said: ‚ÄúOur lowest-paid employees will all receive an above-inflation pay rise. We remain committed to our people and will revisit this decision when appropriate, as part of our continuing review of our cost base.‚Äù In 2015, the then chancellor, George Osborne, rebranded the statutory minimum wage, which all companies must pay, as a ‚Äúnational living wage‚Äù in a backhanded tribute to the living wage campaign, which had pushed for better wages, among other demands, including regular hours and fewer antisocial shifts. But the ‚Äúreal living wage‚Äù campaign, as it renamed itself, continues to commission research and set its own, higher wage floor, based on the cost of living for low-paid workers, and to encourage firms to pledge to pay it. Katherine Chapman, the director of the Living Wage Foundation, which is the guardian of the standard, said she was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù about Capita and BrewDog‚Äôs decisions to drop it, but insisted the movement was still going strong. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had two years of significant increases in the rates, because of what has happened to the cost of living. But we‚Äôve had 3,000 employers signed up in the last year alone,‚Äù she said. Chapman argues that consumers and investors are increasingly conscious of firms‚Äô treatment of their employees, and signing up to pay the real living wage is one way they can differentiate themselves. ‚ÄúFrom what we‚Äôre seeing, and from the businesses we‚Äôre talking to, there is still growth in the network, and there is a compelling case for this,‚Äù she says. It‚Äôs not just the real living wage that has risen sharply to reflect the soaring cost of living ‚Äì the mandatory ‚Äúnational living wage‚Äù is also poised to increase by 10% in April, to ¬£11.44 an hour, as the government continues to pursue a policy of lifting it towards two-thirds of the median rate across the economy. Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation , says two chunky rises in a row have caused disquiet among some companies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting more on the wires from members about it this year than I‚Äôve ever had before,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very concerned with, yes, affordability for them, but also fairness across the workforce.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúIf last year, settlements were 5-8% in the private sector, a 10% minimum wage and living wage increase didn‚Äôt feel massively outside the tent. A second one this year means you‚Äôve basically gone up 20% on entry-level wages in two years. What I‚Äôm hearing is a lot of concern about fairness across the workforce.‚Äù But Nicola Smith, the director of economics at the TUC, flatly rejects the idea the national living wage is becoming unaffordable. ‚ÄúThe TUC continues to call for a minimum wage of at least ¬£15 an hour,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a strong evidence base over the last decade that during some really economically challenging periods, it‚Äôs been possible to raise the minimum wage for the lowest paid people in our jobs market with absolutely no negative labour market effects at all.‚Äù In total, 14,000 employers are committed to paying the ¬£12 an hour real living wage (¬£13.15 in London). Jean-S√©bastien Pelland, the executive director of Eland Cables, is one of them. He says as an owner-manager who works alongside his staff, it is ‚Äúabsolutely the right thing to do, both morally, but also economically‚Äù. ‚ÄúI think treating the people well, and looking after them, really makes sense from an economic point of view,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt requires us to spend less time and money on recruitment. We can build on developing a wider range of skills rather than starting over with the basics over and over again. And it makes Eland Cables a better place to be.‚Äù Mike Turner, the co-founder of Bird & Blend Tea Co, based near Brighton, another company committed to the real living wage, concedes that this year‚Äôs 10% rise was costly ‚Äì particularly once the knock-on impact further up the income scale is taken into account. Of the approximately 180 staff across the firm‚Äôs 17 shops and warehouse, he estimates that about 100 are on the real living wage. ‚ÄúPart of me thinks, yeah, it would have been nice if it was lower, but if it was lower, it wouldn‚Äôt be doing what it‚Äôs for,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point in signing up for a scheme like that if when it starts to bite and have an impact, you pull out of it.‚Äù"

        "content": "BP‚Äôs new chief executive has claimed he can stick to the green goals set by his predecessor without risking shareholder returns by adopting a ‚Äúmore pragmatic‚Äù approach. However, Murray Auchincloss said BP‚Äôs previous ‚Äúaim‚Äù to reduce oil and gas emissions by between 20-30% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade was not confirmed as a ‚Äútarget‚Äù ‚Äì and would only become one depending on a number of final investment decisions ahead. Auchincloss, who replaced Bernard Looney on a permanent basis last month, said BP would create a higher value company for shareholders by moving towards its climate aims ‚Äúwithout wasting money‚Äù. He told the Guardian that BP‚Äôs plan to transform from an oil company to a net zero carbon energy company by 2050 remained. ‚ÄúThe destination is unchanged but we will get there as a much simpler and more pragmatic company, and we will move at the pace that society demands,‚Äù he said. The former chief financial officer used his first set of financial results as CEO to assure investors that he would protect shareholder value by setting out plans to return more cash to investors. BP will spend $3.5bn on share buybacks over the first half of this year, and at least $14bn over the next two years. The move prompted criticism from campaigners, who said the ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù payouts would be better spent on investing in the green transition. The company spent six times more on shareholder distributions last year compared with its investments in renewable energy, according to the IPPR thinktank. BP set out plans to accelerate its share buyback programme alongside its financial results, which showed that profits halved last year to nearly $14bn (¬£11bn) after weaker oil and gas market prices caused revenues to slump across the industry. The better than expected annual profits were still the second-highest reported by BP since 2012. Joseph Evans, a researcher at the IPPR, said: ‚ÄúBP has decided to prioritise its shareholders over investing in the green transition.

That means demanding a rapid clean energy transition for companies like BP. These reckless shareholder payouts do the opposite.‚Äù Auchincloss said: ‚ÄúWe have three jobs: we invest, we pay tax, and we must pay our shareholders. We‚Äôre moving as fast as we can [on low-carbon investments]. I‚Äôm pushing this as fast as I can without wasting money ‚Äì which is very important to shareholders.‚Äù BP‚Äôs green ambitions have been cast in doubt since the abrupt departure of Looney, who stepped down in September after admitting that he had failed to fully disclose his previous relationships with colleagues. Activist hedge fund Bluebell Capital Partners called for BP to drop its plan to curb its future oil and gas production shortly after acquiring a small stake in the company last September. The London-base hedge fund argued that its strategy had depressed its share price and presumed a ‚Äúdrastic decline in oil and gas demand, which we consider to be utterly unrealistic‚Äù.

Its North Sea business incurred a $1.5bn UK tax bill last year, of which $720m was due to the Energy Profits Levy. In 2022, the business incurred $2.2bn tax in the UK, of which $700m was due to the windfall tax. BP shares rose 5% after the better than expected results were announced, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday morning."

        "content": "She has served pizzas and sold vacuum cleaners to pay the bills, almost lost her life in childbirth and lived on every continent but Antarctica. So taking on the British grocery market is only the latest challenge for Co-op boss Shirine Khoury-Haq. She took the reins as the first female chief executive of the Co-operative Group ‚Äì the venerable British institution that encompasses 2,400 convenience stores, funeral homes and insurance and legal services ‚Äì in August 2022. The crisply spoken Beirut-born former accountant initially joined the group in August 2019 as finance director, just months before the pandemic hit. Within that turmoil ‚Äì ¬≠during which her father died from the virus and she was dealing with twin daughters under five ‚Äì Khoury-Haq quickly made her mark at the business, via a round of job cuts and¬†efficiencies. More recently, she has turned to growth, trying to broaden the mutual‚Äôs appeal to young people with pop-up shops at festivals and sponsorship of Co-op Live, a new arena in its Manchester homeland where the mutual‚Äôs 5 million members, who co-own the business via a trust, are getting first dibs on gig tickets before its opening in April. Some may view the Co-op ‚Äì owned by members rather than shareholders ‚Äì as operating an outdated model, struggling to survive against supermarket heavyweights such as Tesco and Sainsbury‚Äôs. But Khoury-Haq sees the founding vision for the Co-op ‚Äì which was set up in Rochdale, Lancashire, in 1844 as a way to ensure local people could access safe food and share in profits ‚Äì as the key to its future success. ‚ÄúGo back to the beginning and it was a disruptive organisation that broke the status quo. It is still that if you use it in the way intended,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYoung people have interest in that. Older members have known it for long time.‚Äù Khoury-Haq says the group is ready to shake up the grocery and funeral care markets as it goes on an expansion drive and tries to sign up millions more members ‚Äì whether by offering tickets for Liam Gallagher or special discounts on milk and bread. Khoury-Haq‚Äôs fundraising drive involved selling the group‚Äôs petrol forecourts business to Asda in 2022 for ¬£600m. The Co-op had hacked back its debts to ¬£123m by July last year, from more than ¬£730m a year before, and is armed with more than ¬£570m of cash on its balance sheet, according to those 2023 figures. More efficiencies are on the cards, but Khoury-Haq says the group is not looking at any more large-scale redundancies after more than 400 head office jobs went in 2022. The Co-op‚Äôs grocery shop empire already accounts for about a quarter of the UK‚Äôs convenience-store sector. That includes 2,400 of its own outlets, plus 5,000 others it supplies, including independent co-ops and independently run Nisa stores. It is aiming to reach at least a 30% share of the market in the next few years and a similar figure this year for ‚Äúquick commerce‚Äù ‚Äì the rapidly expanding market for home delivery of groceries in under half an hour. The Co-op believes its network of local stores will enable it to step in where the likes of rapid grocery delivery firms such as Weezy, Gorillas and Jiffy, funded by private equity, have failed.   The upside, if you can call it that, of tough economic times is that there are opportunities out there for acquisitions, for growth  Shirine Khoury-Haq    There will be more grocery stores, including 440 more Nisa outlets and dozens more Co-op franchisees, but Khoury-Haq says the group will not just acquire sites to meet an arbitrary target. She has warned that the Co-op‚Äôs full year profits are likely to fall back as it invests in cutting prices, joining Tesco and Sainsbury‚Äôs in trying to build loyalty by offering members special promotions rather than its traditional dividend¬†payment. Having moved out of running petrol stations, the group is looking at running stores for other operators or signing them up as franchise partners. It will also look at potentially extending its grocery wholesale business, funeral parlours and legal services. ‚ÄúIn funeral care, there is regulation coming through that will fundamentally change the sector and we‚Äôre seeing shifts in the market in terms of who is and is not able to keep up with the regulations,‚Äù says Khoury-Haq.  ‚ÄúWe are looking at opportunities point by point,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got teams that are scanning the markets. That‚Äôs the upside, if you can call it that, of tough economic times. There are opportunities out there for acquisitions, for growth. We‚Äôre very lucky in that our debt is low. Now we do have cash. And if opportunities arise, then we‚Äôre always on the lookout.‚Äù Khoury-Haq relishes the challenge after a life which has made her an expert in overcoming adversity. She has said she felt she might never return to work after losing her first daughter, and almost dying in labour, after years of fertility treatment. *** She was born to a Turkish mother and Palestinian father whose work in the oil industry took the family around the world. Khoury-Haq had lived on every continent but Antarctica by the age of 12, with stints in Turkey, Brazil and Australia. She speaks five languages and went to university in Australia and the US, but worked for a long time in hospitality ‚Äì including stints at Pizza Hut and McDonald‚Äôs ‚Äì as she juggled work with academic study after her father lost his job. She even sold vacuum cleaners while studying accountancy in the US before she became an executive at McDonald‚Äôs helping turn around underperforming franchises. After completing a part-time MBA, she got a job at IBM and stayed with the technology firm when she moved to the UK to set up home with her second husband. She then moved to the Lloyd‚Äôs insurance market, where she was chief operating officer, before joining the Co-op. Her ambitions for the group are in stark contrast with its fight for survival just over a decade ago, when it was brought to the brink by the near collapse of Co-op Bank. The bank was saved in 2013 by a hedge fund rescue, and the Co-op group sold its final 1% stake in the bank in 2017 for ¬£5m. It has also sold off its farms, pharmacies and travel agencies. But for all her ambition, Khoury-Haq admits the group faces continued headwinds. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still not in stable times. I think consumers are still struggling with cost of living. Mortgage rates have gone up; interest rates have gone up. ‚ÄúWe have to manage our businesses to make sure that we are financially secure, that we are flexible, that we take care of our members and our wider customer base, and that we have both the operational financial flexibility so that if we have to make shifts, we‚Äôre able to do that.‚Äù CV Age 52 Family Married, twin daughters aged seven.

        "content": "Eight million households on means-tested benefits will receive their final cost of living payment to help with high food and energy bills from Tuesday. The ¬£299 payment, the last of three instalments that totalled ¬£900, will go directly into people‚Äôs bank accounts between now and 22 February, without the need to apply. It is part of the government‚Äôs ¬£104bn cost of living support package. The cost of living payment will benefit more than 680,000 households in Scotland, more than 400,000 in Wales and 300,000 in Northern Ireland on means-tested benefits.   Related: UK savings and benefits: are you missing out on free cash?   The payments were introduced in 2022 when the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced a payment of ¬£650 in two instalments in May. In November of that year Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, increased this to ¬£900 across three payments. The government has no current plans to extend the scheme, but charities have urged it to announce fresh support. While the inflation rate has eased considerably from double digits, it rose unexpectedly to 4% in December in the first increase for 10 months, and the cost of household gas and electricity remains high, as a result of an energy crisis caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. Rents have spiralled amid a shortage of properties on the market. Morgan Wild, the interim director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: ‚ÄúIncreasingly, people coming to Citizens Advice are living on empty, unable to afford their essential costs and finding themselves in desperate situations. ‚ÄúOur data shows that the cost of living payments do offer some respite to people, but this is short lived. Historically high energy bills, unaffordable housing and other spiralling costs are keeping people in crisis. ‚ÄúThe government has responded with temporary support but we need more than quick fixes. Long-term commitments are needed to raise people‚Äôs incomes and standard of living.‚Äù In November, a report by the cross-party Commons work and pensions committee concluded that the cost of living payments, while welcome, had not been sufficient to address the scale of the problem and offered only a ‚Äúshort-term reprieve‚Äù for many people struggling with high inflation and bills. Commenting on the final payment to be paid out from Tuesday, Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, said: ‚ÄúThe economy has turned a corner, and with inflation falling we are providing millions of the most vulnerable households with another significant cash boost.‚Äù"

        "content": "The traditional January sales on the high street failed to inspire a revival in consumer spending last month, as households continued to cut back amid the cost of living crisis. Britain‚Äôs largest retailers said sales growth slowed last month as higher living costs weighed heavily on consumers, while weather conditions and strikes on the transport network also hit spending. Total sales rose by 1.2% in January compared with a year earlier, below the annual average growth rate of 3.4%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Much of the rise was the result of inflation driving up the value of goods being sold, masking a drop in sales volumes and a collapse in online spending.   Related: Tax-free shopping for tourists in UK may return as government eyes rethink   ‚ÄúWhile the January sales helped to boost spending in the first two weeks, this did not sustain throughout the month,‚Äù said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson. ‚ÄúLarger purchases, such as furniture, household appliances, and electricals, remained weak as the higher cost of living continued into its third year.‚Äù The latest snapshot follows a disappointing Christmas for retailers after official figures showed a 3.2% monthly decline in December, marking the sharpest plunge since shops were forced to close during the Covid pandemic in 2021. Confirming a lacklustre start to 2024 as households continue to face sustained pressure on living costs, separate figures from Barclays showed consumer card spending grew 3.1% year on year in January ‚Äì below the current headline rate of inflation of 4%. The bank, which processes almost half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said there were some signs of strength amid an increase in consumer confidence. The latest figures showed resilient demand for digital content and takeaway meals as consumers saved money by staying in and watching new TV releases such as Fool Me Once on Netflix and Mean Girls on Amazon Prime. Growth in supermarket spending also increased to 5.2% in January, up from 2.8% in December. In contrasting claims about the health of the retail sector, the BRC suggested warm periods in January had hit spending on winter clothing and footwear, while Barclays blamed the fact consumers stayed away from the shops on cold weather. Separate figures from S&P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed a solid increase in business activity in the UK‚Äôs services sector in January. The purchasing managers index for the sector, which surveys activity in the services industry excluding retail, increased from 53.4 in December to 54.3 in January, the highest level since May 2023. A reading of 50.0 separates growth from contraction. Barclays said its survey of consumer confidence pointed to improving optimism, with confidence in household finances and ability to spend hitting the highest level for more than two years. However, the BRC said increasing confidence was yet to convert into stronger levels of consumer spending. Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer markets, leisure and retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said: ‚ÄúWhile there are some positive signs that mortgage rates are starting to fall and stabilise, and shop inflation has fallen to its lowest level in over a year, the feelgood factor has yet to materialise at the tills.‚Äù"

        "content": "The British electric vehicle maker Arrival has collapsed into administration ‚Äì putting 170 jobs at risk ‚Äì just three years after it was valued at more than $15bn. The company, which had two manufacturing sites in Oxfordshire, has appointed consultancy firm EY as administrator, after failing to launch its debut electric van. The move comes a week after trading in the company was suspended on New York‚Äôs Nasdaq stock exchange and a notification that the firm would be removed from the exchange was filed. Nasdaq said Arrival had not complied with its listing standards after failing to file accounts for 2022.   Related: Millionth pure battery electric car sold in UK after 20 years   The EY administrators said that Arrival‚Äôs liquidity position had been ‚Äúimpacted by challenging market and macroeconomic conditions resulting in delays in getting the group‚Äôs products to market‚Äù. They added: ‚ÄúThe joint administrators are now exploring options for the sale of the business and assets of the companies, including its electric vehicle platforms, software, intellectual property and R&D assets, for the benefit of creditors.‚Äù Arrival was founded in west London in 2014 by Denis Sverdlov, a Russian telecoms billionaire, who stepped aside in late 2022. Sverdlov sold the telecoms firm and mobile phone maker Yota in 2013. Arrival spent heavily on robot-heavy factories in Banbury and Bicester and planned to launch a bus, car and European van. It later cut 800 jobs in the UK and switched its strategy to focus on the US van market. The company now has 400 staff, of which 172 are in the UK and directly affected by the administration. Arrival recently made 39 staff redundant and has struggled to keep a handle on costs, the Financial Times reported. The company received a $660m cash injection when it listed on the stock market in 2021 and was valued at more than $15bn on the Nasdaq at its height. On listing, the firm had planned to focus on vans and buses before potentially moving into smaller passenger vehicles, with a focus at first on taxis, but with the possibility of cars for consumers too. Arrival‚Äôs demise adds another failure to Britain‚Äôs mixed recent history in the electric vehicle market. Britishvolt, the electric vehicle battery maker collapsed into administration last year after struggling to secure investment. However, the Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata agreed to invest ¬£4bn in creating a battery gigafactory in Somerset."

        "content": "Sympathy for Vodafone, viewed over the long term, should be close to zero. This was a company that had the world at its feet at the turn of the century when it made itself global leader in telecoms via an audacious ¬£100bn swoop on Mannesmann in Germany. A few tougher years followed but, even in 2013, Vodafone looked refreshed after the neatly-timed sale of the 45% stake in America‚Äôs biggest mobile phone business, Verizon Wireless, for the princely sum of $130bn (then ¬£84bn). Instead, what‚Äôs transpired is a share price that stands now near a 25-year low (Monday‚Äôs so-so trading update certainly wasn‚Äôt going to move the dial). For the past decade, the Vodafone empire has been in necessary retreat ‚Äì but slowly. Margherita Della Valle became permanent chief executive in April last year promising to accelerate the deal-making and, to her credit, has announced big moves in two out of three big markets where investors were screaming for action. A disposal in Spain is happening and a merger with Three in the UK has been announced. (The Italian saga is more complicated.) But should the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), now taking a formal look, allow the deal with Three to go ahead? Until recently, this column‚Äôs answer would have been no. There are good reasons why regulators have generally regarded four mobile operators, not three, as the minimum required to deliver effective competition in a market.   Related: Vodafone should spin off sensitive work after UAE deal, say UK officials   Unfortunately, there‚Äôs now a fair argument that the ‚Äúfour minimum‚Äù analysis isn‚Äôt working like it used to. The state of play now in the UK is that the two biggest players, EE (owned by BT) and O2 (owned by Virgin Media and Telefonica), are earning comfortably above a 9%-ish cost of capital, while Vodafone and Three have been well below for years, according to regulator Ofcom‚Äôs report in late-2022. That picture does not look like effective competition either. The leaders can pedal softly and invest just enough to maintain their positions, while the third and fourth operators are stuck at the back.   The UK has slipped to last place among G7 economies for average 5G download speeds, according to  Opensignal   The set-up doesn‚Äôt appear to be doing the UK much good either. The country has slipped to last place among G7 economies for average 5G download speeds, according to the research consultancy Opensignal. BT and Virgin Media, one can speculate, face stronger financial incentives to invest in their fixed-line broadband networks, where the so-called alt-nets are serious irritants. And, given Vodafone‚Äôs current sub-par returns in UK mobile, Della Valle would probably be marched out off the door if, in the absence of a cost-spreading combo with Three, she proposed a price-slashing splurge in the UK. The counter-intuitive reality, then, is that three players might provide more genuine competition. Unlike the Three/O2 combo that was quashed in 2016, we‚Äôre talking this time about numbers three and four in the market coming together to fill their networks, the crucial first task in the economics of mobile telephony. Meanwhile, there is more evidence than in 2016 that mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs that do wholesale deals ‚Äì think Tesco Mobile and Sky ‚Äì are here to stay and serve as a brake on prices for consumers. In aggregate, the MVNOs are 17% of the market and EE and O2 dominate as providers. Vodafone/Three would become number one with 27 million subscribers but, if necessary, regulators could always even things up by enforcing the sale of a portion of spectrum. The main imperative would be to find a mechanism to hold the would-be partners to their pledge to invest ¬£11bn in the UK over 10 years. It‚Äôs true that Vodafone hardly deserves a regulatory helping hand given the financial resources it had at its disposal many years ago. The CMA will also need to be satisfied that the MVNO dynamic is solid. But this may be a moment when pragmatism has to prevail. The deal is not obviously outrageous."

        "content": "The explosion in demand for the weight-loss drug Wegovy has led to the holding company behind its maker, Novo Nordisk, buying a leading US-based drugmaker for $16.5bn (¬£13.2bn) to increase capacity. Novo Holdings is to buy the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical firm Catalent, and then immediately sell three of its sites for $11bn in US and Europe to Wegovy Novo Nordisk, which will increase its ability to match supply with growing demand. The deal comes as the popularity of Wegovy and Ozempic, Novo Nordisk‚Äôs diabetes drug, continues to grow, helping to cement the Danish drugmaker as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, with a market value of about $500bn.   Related: Obesity drug boom pushes Novo Nordisk shares to record high   Novo‚Äôs boom has been largely driven by the popularity of the drugs, which are used by celebrities including Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey and are increasingly being used in public health. Obesity drug sales at Novo Nordisk jumped by 154% up to ¬£4.8bn last year, with Wegovy accounting for ¬£3.6bn of that. However, this rise in demand has led to supply problems, with Novo Nordisk having to limit the number of Wegovy starter doses it could issue last May, as demand outpaced the company‚Äôs manufacturing capacity. Novo Holdings‚Äô chief executive, Kasim Kutay, said in an interview with Reuters: ‚ÄúWe have sold some very important fill-finish capacity to Novo Nordisk as part of this transaction. ‚ÄúA key strategic consideration for Novo Nordisk, particularly when thinking about patients and making sure there is broader rollout for Ozempic and Wegovy, is enhanced capacity.‚Äù Novo Holdings owns just over 28% of economic shares in Novo Nordisk and 77% of its voting shares. Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, the president and chief executive at Novo Nordisk, said: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the agreement to acquire the three Catalent manufacturing sites which will enable us to serve significantly more people living with diabetes and obesity in the future.‚Äù The deal between Novo Nordisk and its parent company will mean it pays $11bn for the fill-finish sites in Anagni (Italy), Brussels (Belgium) and Bloomington (Indiana, US). Catalent is already the main supplier of ‚Äúfill and finish‚Äù work, which includes the packaging and filling of injection pens, but the deal means the sites will now exclusively deliver Novo Nordisk drugs.  The two drugs have proved popular in the US, particularly Wegovy, with Novo Nordisk estimating that 1 million Americans have used the drug since it was approved in 2021 and 600,000 are currently using it. Other pharmaceutical firms are looking to recreate Novo‚Äôs success, including Eli Lily with its Mounjaro jab, also known as Zepbound, which also treats patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Trials for the drug have shown it can help people lose about 20kg (three stone) on average. Weight-loss drugs are injected into the body and mimic the action of a gut hormone, GLP-1, by suppressing appetite and slowing the movement of food through the digestive system. They have helped many people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause side-effects ranging from nausea, bloating, diarrhoea and fatigue to more serious stomach, kidney and gallbladder problems and inflammation of the pancreas. The NHS began using Wegovy last September in what it called a ‚Äúcontrolled and limited launch‚Äù. Those eligible should have a body mass index of more than 30 and at least one weight-related co-morbidity. The drug is administered by specialist NHS weight management services alongside a reduced calorie diet and exercise. It was estimated that as many as 50,000 people could be eligible to use the drug."

        "content": "Two of the UK‚Äôs largest lenders, Santander UK and Lloyds Banking Group, allegedly held bank accounts for front companies that helped Iranian entities evade US sanctions, according to reports. The news has rattled investors, who sold off shares in the two banks on Monday morning, amid fears that the lenders could face penalties if they are found to have in any way assisted Iran‚Äôs state-controlled Petrochemical Commercial Company (PCC). The Tehran-controlled company has been accused by US officials of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards al-Quds Force, and working with Russian intelligence agencies. PCC and its British subsidiary have been under US sanctions since November 2018. PCC is alleged to have moved money through a Santander UK business bank account by using a front company registered to a detached house in Surrey, according to documents seen by the Financial Times. It also used a separate front company to move money through an account at Lloyds Banking Group, the newspaper claimed. The report will raise fresh concerns about how the UK‚Äôs financial system could be being used to launder cash or hide illicit payments. ‚ÄúThis is, frankly, a shocking failure to act in lockstep with our allies to shut down the financing of a hostile regime,‚Äù said Liam Byrne, Labour MP and chair of the business and trade committee. ‚ÄúIt beggars belief that a business sanctioned by the US is freely trading in London.‚Äù He wrote on the X platform that MPs on the committee would be ‚Äúcross-examining ministers, Companies House, National Crime Agency, HMRC & SFO [Serious Fraud Office] to explain how the hell this happened‚Äù when it holds an evidence session on economic crime on Tuesday morning.

Shares in Santander, which is listed in Spain, fell by more than 3%. Santander said it had not broken any rules. ‚ÄúSantander is not in breach of US sanctions based on our investigation. We have policies and procedures in place to ensure we comply with sanctions requirements and will continue to engage proactively with relevant UK and US authorities.‚Äù Lloyds is also pushing back against the claims outlined in the FT report. ‚ÄúWe believe we have met all legal and regulatory obligations and, based on our own investigation, we do not believe we have breached any sanction requirements,‚Äù the banking group said in a statement."

The UK‚Äôs services sector grew at the fastest rates since last May in January, helped by the prospect of interest rate cuts.S&P Global‚Äôs UK services PMI rose to 54.3 in January from 53.4 in December, an eight-month high, with firms reporting a rise in new orders Germany‚Äôs economy is struggling, though, with its service sector shrinking in January while imports and exports both fell in December. The dollar has strengthened after America‚Äôs top central banker said the U.S. Federal Reserve can be ‚Äúprudent‚Äù in deciding when to cut its benchmark interest rate.Chair Jerome Powell told CBS‚Äôs ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù show that the Fed wants to see confirmation that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustainable way.Powell also indicated that Fed policymakers still expect to cut rates three times this year. Powell‚Äôs comments pushed the dollar to its highest level against the pound since December. Central banks should be certain they have beaten inflation before cutting interest rates this year, the OECD has warned, as it raised its growth forecasts for this year. McDonald‚Äôs has missed sales forecasts, after takings in the Middle East were hit by boycotts against the company due to the Israel-Hamas war. The pharmaceuticals firm behind the anti-obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy is spending $11bn to boost its production facilities, after struggling to keep up with demand. The UK has registered its one millionth electric car Boeing could have to delay deliveries of more of its bestselling 737 Max planes after a supplier found new production glitches, adding to pressure on the beleaguered US manufacturer.      3.31pm GMT  Estee Lauder to cut up to 5% of workforce  Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder will cut about 3% to 5% of its global workforce. The cuts come as Estee Lauder tries to rebuild its profit margins, as a turnaround at it Chinese business is taking longer than expected. Estee expects incremental operating profit between $1.1bn and $1.4bn from the efforts, up from $800m to $1bn it estimated earlier and looks to record between $500m and $700m in charges before taxes. Shares in the company have jumped 15%.     3.04pm GMT   Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in construction equipment firm Caterpillar are up 3% after it beat analyst forecasts today. Caterpillar reported a 3% rise in sales and revenues in the last quarter of 2023, with full year sales up 13%.

This set of results from the fast-food giant has some disappointments for investors, but it‚Äôs not all bad. The glass-half-full take is that adjusted earnings per share were stronger than expected. The problem is in the sales and growth figures though, and that has driven the initial negative reaction in pre-market trading. Not only did revenue come up slightly short of expectations, but there‚Äôs an underperformance in same-store sales growth. A year ago we had growth of 10.9%, but expectations for this most recent quarter were for a much more modest 4.7% ‚Äì unfortunately, McDonald‚Äôs missed even that low bar, delivering just 3.4%, with stores in the Middle East dragging on the global figure. The company noted the impact of the war in the Middle East in its press release, and there are echoes here of a similar issue from Starbucks when it reported recently. Domestic sales growth was broadly in line with Wall Street expectations though.      2.06pm GMT  OECD concerned by drop in reading and mathematics skills  The OECD are calling on governments to take steps to improve educational outcomes and enhance skills development, to tackle the drop in reading and maths skills during the pandemic. Today‚Äôs OECD economic outlook flags the ‚Äúunprecedented drop in performance in many countries for 15-year-olds tested on reading and mathematics‚Äù. OECD empirical work suggests that this decline in PISA scores could have a persisting negative impact on the level of productivity over the next 30-40 years, it says. School closures during the pandemic may have contributed to the recent drop in test scores, particularly for disadvantaged students who were unable to benefit fully from on-line teaching, the OECD say. However, they add that the problem also predates Covid-19, saying:  However, the recent decline in performance continues a downward trend in test scores prior to 2018, pointing to longer-term issues in educational systems in some countries.      1.23pm GMT  McDonald‚Äôs says Middle East war hits sales  Fast food giant McDonalds has blamed conflict in the Middle East for weakening its sales in the region. McDonalds has reported that while global sales grew by 3.4% in the last quarter, its International Developmental Licensed Markets segment only expanded by 0.7% ‚Äúreflecting the impact of the war in the Middle East‚Äù. The company adds:  Segment performance reflected positive comparable sales in all geographic regions, with the exception of the Middle East, which was impacted by the war in the region.  McDonald‚Äôs 3.4% rise in comparable sales missed investor expectations, Bloomberg reports. According to Reuters, investors had expected growth of 5.5% at its International Developmental Licensed Markets arm, so the weaker performance has created its first sales miss in almost four years. Last month, McDonald‚Äôs CEO Chris Kempczinski said customers boycotting the firm in the Middle East for its perceived support of Israel were having a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù hit to business, adding that such calls were based on ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù.

La Monica (@LaMonicaBuzz) February 5, 2024  US sales grew by 4.3%, partly due to price rises (or ‚Äústrategic menu price increases‚Äù) and marketing spend. Sales at its International Operated Markets segment increased by 4.4%. with sale growth in the UK, Germany and Canada offsetting falling sales in France. For last year as a whole, McDonald‚Äôs grew its like-for-like sales by 9%. Kempczinski says today that McDonald‚Äôs remains ‚Äúconfident in the resilience of our business amid macro challenges that will persist in 2024.‚Äù  McDonald's: \"International Developmental Licensed Markets: Segment performance reflected positive comparable sales in all geographic regions, with the exception of the Middle East, which was impacted by the war in the region.\" https://t.co/LtKgm4fPzF‚Äî Sam Ro üìà (@SamRo) February 5, 2024   Updated at 1.50pm GMT    12.42pm GMT  Weight loss drug firm Novo Nordisk spending $11bn to boost production  The pharmaceuticals firm behind the anti-obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy is spending $11bn to boost its production facilities, after struggling to keep up with demand. Novo Holdings, the controlling shareholder of weight-loss drug maker Novo Nordisk, is buying drug manufacturing group Catalent in $16.5bn deal. Novo will then sell Catalent‚Äôs key facilities to Novo Nordisk for $11bn, with the deal expected to conclude by the end of 2024.   Related: Sales soar at Danish firm behind weight-loss drug semaglutide   Those three manufacturing sites, which specialise in the sterile filling of drugs, are located in the Italian town of Anagni, in Brussels, and in Bloomington, in the US state of Indian. The three sites employ more than 3,000 people and all have ongoing collaborations with Novo Nordisk. Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, president and chief executive officer at Novo Nordisk, says:  ‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the agreement to acquire the three Catalent manufacturing sites which will enable us to serve significantly more people living with diabetes and obesity in the future. The acquisition complements the significant investments we are already doing in active pharmaceutical ingredients facilities, and the sites will provide strategic flexibility to our existing supply network.‚Äù  Last year Novo Nordisk was forced to restrict the supply of the lowest dose of Wegovy, due to shortages. It has also warned that Ozempic is likely to be impacted by intermittent supply shortages running into 2025, Diabetes UK says.   Related: Wegovy: the slimming drug that keeps Denmark‚Äôs economy growing   Shares in Novo Nordisk have jumped 3% today, to a new record high.  Updated at 1.31pm GMT    12.14pm GMT   The pick-up in UK service sector activity last month could deter the Bank of England from cutting interest rates soon, argues Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at T. Rowe Price. Faster service sector growth, and reports of elevated wage pressures, could even put further interest rate rises back on the agenda, Wieladek suggests ‚Äì which isn‚Äôt something investors currently think is likely. Wieladek says:  The message from today‚Äôs PMI is that activity is reaccelerating and hiring is rising, but supply chain restrictions due to the Red Sea attacks will likely partially impede the strong disinflation expected previously. These trends in the data will likely be exacerbated by the government‚Äôs recent changes in fiscal policy. The 2% cut in National Insurance in January will likely support the reacceleration of the economy. Furthermore, additional broad-based tax cuts will probably add further fuel to economic momentum after the Budget in March. I believe the data today, together with the government‚Äôs fiscal policy, will help the UK grow faster than the eurozone in 2024. These data imply that the Bank of England will need to be more patient than expected. Given a falling unemployment rate, likely rising employment, accelerating economic activity, and elevated supply chain inflation risks, it is now becoming likely the Bank of England will need to wait significantly longer than expected to deliver the first rate cut. It is now likely the BoE may only be able to cut in November 2024. Furthermore, if the data continue to be this strong and suggest persistent above-target inflation into the second half of 2024, rate hikes might come back on the table. That is, the Bank of England may have to consider hiking again to ensure inflation remains at the 2% target in the medium term. This is not a scenario markets are pricing today.      11.32am GMT   The oil price has dropped to its lowest level in almost three weeks, as hopes build for a ceasefire in Gaza. Brent crude is down 0.5% today at $76.98 per barrel, the lowest since 17 January. This follows reports last week that Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer towards a deal for a ceasefire, which knocked the oil price lower. The reported outline of the proposal envisages a lengthy ceasefire of about six weeks in which Palestinians in Gaza would be allowed to move around the strip freely, while hostages would be released in three phases in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel, as reported here. The framework of this deal has been put to Hamas.   Related: Israel and Hamas closer to ceasefire deal amid warning over Gaza children   Oil has dipped today despite further attacks against Houthi groups in Yemen over the weekend. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is due to arrive in Saudi Arabia today, on a trip to the region to push for a ‚Äòhumanitarian pause‚Äô in the Israel-Hamas war, and an agreement that secures the release of all remaining hostages. He is also scheduled to visit Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and the West Bank.

The pound has lost half a cent against the dollar to $1.2579, the lowest level since 13 December. This is due to dollar strength ‚Äì the greenback has rallied by 0.35% this morning, after Fed chair Powell warned of the risks of cutting interest rates too early. The dollar also rallied strongly on Friday, after the blowout non-farm payroll jobs report.     10.41am GMT   PwC‚Äôs Jenny Etherton says 2024 is off to a positive start with an injection of optimism for the UK services sector:  ‚ÄúServices activity grew again for the third month in a row as business and consumer confidence translated into new orders in anticipation of continued falls in inflation and interest rate cuts.  ‚ÄúDespite this, we are seeing a continued flattening for recruitment, with ongoing wage pressures making a significant impact. However, some firms are bucking the trend by creating new jobs to ensure they have the capacity they need to meet stronger order books.       10.35am GMT   Today‚Äôs UK service sector PMI report shows the economy looks to have begun 2024 on a stronger note than it ended last year, says Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. He adds there was also ‚Äúgood news on the inflation front‚Äù, explaining:  According to January‚Äôs services survey, lower fuel costs and raw material prices contributed to input price inflation faced by services firms in January rising at the joint-slowest pace in almost three years. And output price growth eased to the weakest since last September. ‚ÄúLower cost and price balances, combined with an upbeat set of readings for the survey‚Äôs forward-looking indicators, are consistent with the EY ITEM Club‚Äôs view that inflation will fall back quickly over the coming months and momentum in economic activity will likely continue to build. The latest survey should also offer the Bank of England some reassurance that the economy‚Äôs exit out of its recent stagnation may not necessarily present an inflationary threat.‚Äù   Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.17am GMT   The OECD‚Äôs new forecasts also predict the UK will suffer the highest level of inflation of all the G7 countries. At 2.8% this year, prices in the UK are seen rising faster than Canada (at 2.6%), France (2.7%), Germany (2.6%), Italy (1.8%), Japan (2.6%) and the United States (2.2%).  Updated at 10.20am GMT    10.14am GMT  Central banks must beat inflation before cutting interest rates, says OECD  The OECD is also warning central banks should be certain they have beaten inflation before cutting interest rates this year, my colleague Phillip Inman reports. The Paris-based thinktank, which represents 38 countries, said it was ‚Äútoo soon to be sure that underlying price pressures are fully contained‚Äù. UK inflation has been forecasted to fall sharply this year after a steep drop in the cost of energy and fuel back towards pre-pandemic levels. The OECD said a forecast in November had underestimated the waning of inflationary pressures in the UK and an average rate of 2.9% expected this year was more likely to be 2.8%. The US inflation rate in 2024 would be 2.2%, down from a previous forecast of 2.8%.   Related: Central banks must beat inflation before cutting interest rates, says OECD   This rather chimes with the comments from Federal Reserve Jerome Powell to 60 Minutes last night, when he explained the Fed should be prudent when deciding when to start cutting rates.     10.11am GMT  OECD lifts global growth forecast  Newsflash: The OECD has lifted its forecast for global growth this year, helped by a stronger performance from the US. In its latest economic outlook, the OECD has raised its globl growth forecast for 2024 to 2.9%, up from 2.7% three months ago. America‚Äôs economy is now expected to grow by 2.1% this year, better than the 1.5 % previously expected. But the eurozone‚Äôs growth forecast has been cut, from 0.9% to just 0.6%, as the slowdown in Germany weighs on Europe. Germany is forecast to see the weakest expansion in the G7 this year at just 0.3%. The OECD still expects the UK to grow by 0.7% this year. And it warns that attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes could add to inflationary pressures. Today‚Äôs report estimates that if a surge in shipping costs persisted annual OECD import price inflation could increase by close to 5 percentage points, adding 0.4 percentage points to consumer price inflation after about a year.     9.58am GMT   This month‚Äôs survey of UK purchasing managers also shows a rise in business optimism, despite concerns over geopolitical tensions, Brexit trade frictions and the looming UK general election. Around 52% of the survey panel forecast a rise in business activity over the course of 2024, while only 12% predict a reduction.  That is the strongest degree of positive sentiment since April 2023, lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts. Today‚Äôs PMI survey explains:  Anecdotal evidence suggested that long-term business expansion plans and supportive economic conditions had underpinned service sector growth projections for the next 12 months. Some firms also cited a favourable impact from looser financial conditions and expected interest rate cuts. Survey respondents nonetheless noted that geopolitical concerns, Brexit trade frictions, and domestic political uncertainty were all factors that could constrain business activity in the year ahead.      9.45am GMT  UK services sector revival gains momentum with fastest growth since May  Newsflash: The UK‚Äôs services sector has posted its strongest monthly performance since last May. Services sector firms have reported a faster rise in business activity and new orders in January, spurring them to hire more staff. This lifted the UK services PMI index up to 54.3 in January, up from 53.4 in December, the third month running it‚Äôs been over 50 points (showing growth), and an eight-month high.  Services PMI in the United Kingdom increased to 54.30 points in January from 53.40 points in December of 2023.https://t.co/Tti1VJNW5C pic.twitter.com/rqrRrrl4Ur‚Äî TRADING ECONOMICS (@tEconomics) February 5, 2024  Encouragingly, cost inflation eases to the joint-lowest rate since February 2021, thanks to lower fuel costs and raw material prices, although staff salaries continued to rise. Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, says:  ‚ÄúThe revival in UK service sector performance gained momentum at the start of 2024, with output growth accelerating to its fastest for eight months amid stronger business and consumer spending. New orders have also rebounded this winter as receding recession risks and looser financial conditions led to greater willingness-tospend among clients. Inflationary pressures subsided during January, despite stronger demand conditions. Latest data indicated that total input costs increased at one of the slowest rates seen in the past three years. Softer cost inflation reflected lower energy and fuel costs, alongside falling raw material prices. Service providers reporting an increase in their operating expenses overwhelmingly linked this to elevated wage pressures. This resulted in another month of robust rise in average prices charged, although the speed of inflation dipped to a four-month low. A combination of falling inflation and improving order books provided a strong boost to business activity expectations across the service economy. The degree of optimism regarding year ahead growth prospects was the highest since April 2023. Another uplift in business confidence in January provides a signal that elevated levels of geopolitical uncertainty have yet to exert much of a constraint on service sector growth projections for 2024.‚Äù   Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.19am GMT  One million electric cars sold in the UK  The UK has registered its one millionth electric car, new data from industry group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT has reported that 20,935 battery-powered electric cars (BEVs) were registered in January, around 21% more than a year ago. That has lifted the overall total since 2002 to 1,001,677, which the SMMT says is ‚Äútestament to the commitment of manufacturers to deliver ever-increasing numbers of zero emission models‚Äù. Overall, the UK car market grew by 8.2% in January, the SMMT says, which is the 18th month in a row. But sales to private buyers fell by 15.8%, while the fleet market (sales to businesses) grew nearly 30%.  UK reaches million EV milestone as new car market growshttps://t.co/Y1IwMi3cFR pic.twitter.com/OyDLoyX4TN‚Äî SMMT (@SMMT) February 5, 2024  Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said chancellor Jeremy Hunt should do more to help the electric car market in next month‚Äôs budget:  It‚Äôs taken just over 20 years to reach our million EV milestone ‚Äì but with the right policies, we can double down on that success in just another two. Market growth is currently dependent on businesses and fleets. Government must therefore use the upcoming Budget to support private EV buyers, temporarily halving VAT to cut carbon, drive economic growth and help everyone make the switch. Manufacturers have been asked to supply the vehicles, we now ask government to help consumers buy the vehicles on which net zero depends.   BEV market share for January also grew year on year to 14.7%, although this is below the full 2023 performance of 16.5%. PHEVs recorded volume growth of 31.1% to take 8.4% of the market, while HEV volumes fell -1.2% with a 13.1% share.https://t.co/Y1IwMi3cFR pic.twitter.com/iW5EhwkbRf‚Äî SMMT (@SMMT) February 5, 2024      9.08am GMT  Germany's service sector shrinks again  Another blow for Germany: its service sector has shrunk for the fourth consecutive month in January. Data provider S&P Global has reported that business activity across Germany‚Äôs service sector fell for a fourth straight month in January, at the quickest rate since last August. The decline was driven by ongoing weakness in demand, S&P Global reports. Its German services PMI business activity index dropped to a five-month low of 47.7 for last month, down from December‚Äôs 49.3. Any reading below 50 shows contraction. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:   ‚ÄúBad ending, even worse start. This is the summary of the German service sector at the start of the year, as the corresponding PMI has deteriorated further in January from the subdued December level. One painful fact is that new business has shrunk for the seventh month straight and its downward momentum gained pace for the second successive month. Remarkably, outstanding business is experiencing its most rapid decline since June 2020. This is possibly hinting at a wave of order cancellations by clients.

According to the FT, Lloyds and Santander UK provided accounts to British front companies secretly owned by a sanctioned Iranian petrochemicals company based near Buckingham Palace. The FT explains:  The state-controlled Petrochemical Commercial Company was part of a network that the US accuses of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and of working with Russian intelligence agencies to raise money for Iranian proxy militias.

The Office for National Statistics has released new Labour Force Survey (LFS) data which show that the UK‚Äôs jobless rate is 3.9% in the last quarter, not the 4.2% estimated before. But more worryingly, the ONS has also revised up its estimate of the inactivity rate to 21.9% in the three months to November, from the 20.8% recorded previously. This new data follows a rejig of the LFS, which had become unreliable due to a poor response rate from the public. Today‚Äôs new data shows that the UK population is now estimated to have increased by more than previously thought. Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, says the data shows the jobs market is bigger but weaker than previous estimates.  ‚ÄúBritain has a bigger, but sicker, workforce than we previously thought. Of particular concern is that the fact that a record 2.8 million people in the country are currently inactive due to ill-health. ‚ÄúTackling rising ill-health is a huge social and economic challenges that we‚Äôll be facing throughout the 2020s, as will getting the UK employment back up to and beyond pre-pandemic levels.‚Äù   Britain has a bigger, but sicker, workforce than previously thought - @hcslaughter_ examines what the @ONS reweighting of the labour force survey means for the UK workforce.

Vodafone‚Äôs service revenue growth in Germany fell to just 0.3% in the last quarter, down from 1.1% in the previous three months. That‚Äôs also weaker than the 4.7% increase in Vodafone‚Äôs overall service revenue in the quarter. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  ‚ÄúVodafone‚Äôs third quarter had some pockets of optimism for investors to cling to. Growth was in line with the second quarter, arguably a better result than some had feared.  The key German market managed to scrape its way into growth territory but saw a slowdown. Comparisons to the second quarter were always going to be tough, with some non-recurring revenue streams not repeating.  Regulatory changes in Germany are set to kick in this year, adding a layer of uncertainty to operations in the region.  Shares in Vodafone have dropped over 1% at the start of trading, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.     8.07am GMT   US bond prices are falling after Jerome Powell said the Fed should take a prudent approach when deciding when to start cutting interest rates. This has pushed up the yield (the rate of return) on US 10-year Treasury bonds by 5 basis points to 4.08%, from 4.03% on Friday night, while shorter-dated two-year Treasuries are 7 basis points higher at 4.44%. That suggests bond traders are dialling back their expectations for interest rates cuts this year. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients this morning:  The confirmation that he [Powell] wasn‚Äôt going to use the broadcast for a big dovish turnaround has caused 2yr and 10yr treasuries to back up 4-5bps overnight, adding to Friday‚Äôs big climb.   Updated at 8.22am GMT    7.54am GMT  German exports drop in December  Germany‚Äôs manufacturers have suffered a sharp fall in exports, as concerns over the health of Europe‚Äôs largest economy mount. Exports fell 4.6% month-on-month in December, and were also 4.6% lower than a year ago, new figures from the federal statistics body show. The fall in exports was broad-based; sales to other eurozone countries fell by 5.5% month-on-month, compared to a 3.5% drop in exports to the rest of the world. Destatis reports:  Most German exports went to the United States in December 2023. After calendar and seasonally adjusted adjustments, 5.5% fewer goods were exported there than in November 2023. This means that exports to the United States fell to a value of 12.7 billion euros. Exports to the People‚Äôs Republic of China fell by 7.9% to 7.5 billion euros, exports to the United Kingdom fell by 4.3% to 7.4 billion euros.

Updated at 8.22am GMT    7.53am GMT  Introduction: Powell warns against moving too soon on rate cuts  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. America‚Äôs top central banker has pushed back against expectations of a flurry of interest rate cuts this year, while flagging that borrowing costs will be lowered at some point in 2024. Jerome Powell, head of the US Federal Reserve, told CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes that the Fed was alert to the danger of moving too soon and cutting rates before inflation was fully tamed. He warned:  The danger of moving too soon is that the job‚Äôs not quite done, and that the really good readings we‚Äôve had for the last six months somehow turn out not to be a true indicator of where inflation‚Äôs heading. We don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. But the prudent thing to do is to, is to just give it some time and see that the data continue to confirm that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustainable way.   Powell says Fed can be 'prudent' in weighing rate cuts -- CBS '60 Minutes' https://t.co/mh7T2XfjDN pic.twitter.com/aNzJMgfdnO‚Äî Reuters U.S. News (@ReutersUS) February 5, 2024  US CPI inflation was recorded at 3.4% per year in December, above the Fed‚Äôs target of 2%, but down on the 6.5% recorded in December 2022. The Fed currently sets its key rate at 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest since 2001, and many investors ‚Äì and borrowers ‚Äì are keen to see it cut. Powell explained that the US Fed must balance the risks of moving too soon, versus reacting too late, adding:  And there are different risks. We think the economy‚Äôs in a good place. We think inflation is coming down. We just want to gain a little more confidence that it‚Äôs coming down in a sustainable way toward our 2% goal.  (The Bank of England made rather similar comment last week.) Powell told 60 Minutes that ‚Äúalmost every single person‚Äù on the Fed‚Äôs Open Market Committee believes that it will be appropriate to reduce interest rates this year. And he indicated that policymakers are sticking with their forecast last December that they will make three quarter-point cuts to rates in 2024. Powell said the Fed would issue new forecasts at its next meeting in March, but added:  Nothing has happened in the meantime that would lead me to think that people would dramatically change their forecasts.  Powell added that it is ‚Äúnot likely‚Äù that the FOMC would feel confident enough to cut rates in March.

        "content": "The first Monday of February is apparently the most popular day for employees to call in sick, so the timing of the latest labour market health check by Britain‚Äôs number crunchers could scarcely have been better. According to the latest evidence the UK has an even bigger problem with inactivity due to long-term sickness than previously thought. Fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there are now 2.8 million people classified as not looking for work because of health issues ‚Äì up from the 2.6 million previously estimated and a one-third increase on the 2.1 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.   Related: The Observer view on the nation‚Äôs poor health | Observer editorial   The ONS has rejigged its view of what has been happening to employment, unemployment and inactivity in order to take account of the fact the size of the UK‚Äôs population has been revised up. Its tentative conclusions are that the labour market is bigger, sicker and tighter than the old data suggested. While the ONS was at pains to caution against reading too much into its new estimates, they show that employment is 170,000 higher than was thought but there are more prime age (16- to 64-year-old) people not working or looking for jobs, and long-term sickness now accounts for more than 30% of inactivity. Hannah Slaughter, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: ‚ÄúTackling rising ill-health is a huge social and economic challenges that we‚Äôll be facing throughout the 2020s, as will getting the UK employment back up to and beyond pre-pandemic levels.‚Äù  Interactive  The ONS view of recent short-term developments has also changed. It believes unemployment stood at 3.9% in the three months ending in November last year, lower than its previous 4.2% estimate. The Bank of England is closely monitoring the labour market for signs of an easing of pay pressure. Analysts said the new ONS estimates might make Threadneedle Street‚Äôs monetary policy committee more cautious about cutting interest rates. ‚ÄúThe new figures show that the labour market is tighter than believed previously. Furthermore there is no evidence that conditions have loosened recently,‚Äù said Philip Shaw of Investec. James Moberly of Goldman Sachs said: ‚ÄúThe reduction in the unemployment rate suggests that progress on labour market rebalancing may have stalled, which has somewhat hawkish implications for the Bank.‚Äù The reason the ONS warned against reading too much into the new data is that it lacks a complete picture of the labour market after suspending statistics from what had been its main gauge of developments ‚Äì the Labour Force Survey ‚Äì on the grounds that weak response rates made the results unreliable. The LFS was replaced by an experimental series based on a range of sources including the claimant count and PAYE data. It will take until September before the ONS is ready to announce its replacement for the LFS. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said the ONS still had ‚Äúlittle faith‚Äù in the quality of its figures and was only willing to say that unemployment rate ‚Äúmay have fallen‚Äù. He said more recent evidence, including rising redundancy notifications, showed rising unemployment."

        "content": "Boeing could have to delay deliveries of more of its bestselling 737 Max planes after a supplier found new production glitches, adding to pressure on the beleaguered US manufacturer. The aircraft maker will have to conduct work on about 50 undelivered planes after its supplier Spirit AeroSystems discovered two holes drilled incorrectly. Boeing‚Äôs share price fell by 2.2% in early trading on Monday, while Spirit‚Äôs fell by 3.9%. The latest mishap comes with Boeing under severe scrutiny over its manufacturing processes after part of the fuselage fell off a plane last month. A panel plugging an unused door hole fell from an Alaska Airlines flight shortly after takeoff, forcing the plane to turn back to Portland, Oregon, although there were no serious injuries. Until the latest incident, Boeing had been trying to increase production of its 737 Max after years in the doldrums when two planes crashed because of design flaws. The model was grounded for nearly two years after 346 people died onboard Lion Air flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 in March 2019. However, Boeing has come under pressure from its airline customers after the Alaska incident highlighted apparent continued failures in its safety processes. Tim Clark, the head of Emirates Airlines, has become the latest airline leader to call for significant change at Boeing. Speaking in an interview with the Financial Times, published on Sunday, he said Boeing was in the ‚Äúlast chance saloon‚Äù after a ‚Äúprogressive decline‚Äù in standards. Clark said Boeing had to ‚Äúinstil this safety culture which is second to none‚Äù and ‚Äúget their manufacturing processes under review so there are no corners cut‚Äù. He mirrored a regular criticism of Boeing from some in the industry that it had focused too much on financial returns. Boeing‚Äôs board, he said, needed to prioritise production: ‚ÄúNot: ‚ÄòWhat is the return on investment? What is the bottom line? What is the free cashflow? What is the shareholder value? What is the share value? What is my bonus?‚Äô No, that will come if you do it right in the first place.‚Äù As of Friday, the incorrectly drilled holes had been found in 22 fuselages out of 47 inspected up to that point, spread between Boeing and Spirit, and may exist in some 737s in service, according to sources cited by Reuters. An employee from Spirit AeroSystems, which is the sole supplier of the fuselage for the 737 Max, reportedly discovered that the holes were too close to the edge of the piece of metal in a window frame. A Boeing spokesperson pointed to a public letter to Boeing staff from the chief executive of the commercial planes arm, Stan Deal. He wrote: ‚ÄúThis past Thursday, a supplier notified us of a non-conformance in some 737 fuselages. I want to thank an employee at the supplier who flagged to his manager that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to our requirements.‚Äù Deal wrote that the incorrect holes were ‚Äúnot an immediate flight safety issue and all 737s can continue operating safely‚Äù. In response to criticisms from airlines, Boeing referred to comments last month by the chief executive, Dave Calhoun, who said: ‚ÄúWe understand why they are angry and we will work to earn their confidence.‚Äù He said the manufacturer had ‚Äútaken close care not to push the system too fast‚Äù, but had ‚Äúmore work to do‚Äù. A Spirit spokesperson said: ‚ÄúA member of our team identified an issue that does not conform to engineering standards. Once notified, we began immediate actions to identify and implement appropriate repair solutions. We are in close communication with Boeing on this matter.‚Äù"

        "content": "The number of pure battery electric cars sold in the UK has passed 1m, a milestone that reflects the rapid shift away from polluting fossil fuels that is crucial to Britain‚Äôs target to produce net zero carbon emissions. Between 2002 and the end of January buyers registered 1,001,677 of the vehicles in the UK, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the lobby group for the British industry. While it has taken 20 years to sell 1m electric cars ‚Äì or more than 120 years if taking into account the very first battery-powered vehicles ‚Äì the lobby group said it was possible the industry could sell the second million within only two years, as carmakers around the world race to dominate the electric vehicle industry. The number of electric cars on UK roads is still dwarfed by those using fossil fuels. There were 35.1m cars on UK roads in 2022, of which 650,000 were pure electric, according to the latest available data from the SMMT. However, the UK is planning to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, and manufacturers must sell an increasing proportion of electric cars or else face the prospect of large fines under a new zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate this year. The EU, China and several US states also have similar rules, albeit with different deadlines. There may be some hiccups in the expansion of battery car sales. Some big carmakers, including Toyota, the Land Rover owner JLR, and Nissan, have asked the UK government to delay the ZEV mandate, arguing the rules were set too late for them to adjust their plans. Nevertheless, every big manufacturer across Europe, the US and China is racing to develop and manufacture electric models. The industry also has concerns about the pace of installation of electric car chargers, and the upfront price of electric cars, both of which could hold back buyers. The share of electric car sales in the UK raced to 17.8% in 2022, but declined to 16.5% in 2023 before the enforced sale of more battery cars under the ZEV mandate.  Carmakers sold 20,900 electric cars in January, up by 21% on the same month in 2023. However, the sales were heavily dependent on company fleets, which receive indirect subsidies. Sales to private buyers fell by a quarter. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, called for subsidies for private electric car sales to arrest the decline. The government removed all direct subsidies for electric car sales in 2022. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taken just over 20 years to reach our million EV milestone ‚Äì but with the right policies, we can double down on that success in just another two,‚Äù Hawes said. ‚ÄúMarket growth is currently dependent on businesses and fleets. Government must therefore use the upcoming budget to support private EV buyers, temporarily halving VAT to cut carbon, drive economic growth and help everyone make the switch.‚Äù"

Danker was dismissed by the CBI last year, after allegations related to his conduct while director general. In March 2023, the Guardian revealed that formal and informal complaints had been made against him by junior staff at the lobby group.A spokesperson for the CBI said: ‚ÄúThe CBI has today settled legal action brought against the organisation by Tony Danker after his dismissal in April 2023. The CBI board has agreed an undisclosed settlement with Mr Danker.‚ÄùThey added: ‚ÄúThe CBI board also reiterates that Mr Danker is not associated in any way with the historical allegations reported in the media concerning matters which pre-date his tenure at the CBI and rejects any such association.‚ÄùThe CBI sacked Danker with immediate effect in April 2023 after an investigation into complaints about his conduct in the workplace. These allegations were separate to those later revealed by a Guardian investigation into conduct at the lobby group.Danker said in a statement on X (formerly known as Twitter) after the announcement of his dismissal in April 2023: ‚ÄúI recognise the intense publicity the CBI has suffered following the revelations of awful events that occurred before my time in office.‚ÄúI was appalled to learn about them for the first time last week ‚Ä¶ I was nevertheless shocked to learn this morning that I had been dismissed from the CBI, instead of being invited to put my position forward as was originally confirmed.‚ÄùThe CBI had hired a law firm to investigate him after it was approached by the Guardian about a formal complaint made in January, as well a number of alleged informal reports of concerns over his behaviour.At that time Danker said he was ‚Äúshocked to learn‚Äù of his dismissal, adding that he was ‚Äútruly sorry‚Äù for making colleagues ‚Äúfeel uncomfortable‚Äù.Separate complaints, unrelated to Danker‚Äôs personal conduct, were reported by the Guardian in 2023. These included claims by more than a dozen women alleging various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the organisation.Danker led the CBI from November 2020 until spring 2023.

The Paris-based organisation, which represents 38 countries, said it was ‚Äútoo soon to be sure that underlying price pressures are fully contained‚Äù. It warned that inflation in the UK would persist at the highest level in the G7 this year, forecasting a rate of 2.8%, despite sharp declines in the headline rate in recent months amid cooling global energy prices. The US inflation rate in 2024 would be 2.2%, down from a previous forecast of 2.8%. ‚ÄúMonetary policy needs to remain prudent, that is restrictive, for some time to come to ensure inflationary pressures are contained,‚Äù said Mathias Cormann, the secretary general of the OECD.  However, in a shot across the bows of central banks considering early cuts in the cost of borrowing, it said that while wage demands had ‚Äúbecome better balanced‚Äù, pay rises ‚Äúgenerally remain above rates compatible with medium-term inflation objectives‚Äù. The attacks in the Red Sea, which have disrupted shipping through the Suez Canal, could also trigger a second round of inflationary pressure, it said. Cormann said continued disruption could add 0.4 percentage points to inflation across the OECD area this year if a doubling in shipping costs was sustained, while there were also risks to inflation from robust growth in workers‚Äô pay, corporate profits or weaker productivity growth. ‚ÄúA widening or escalating of the conflict in the Middle East could lead to renewed price pressures and shortages, and a decline in global growth,‚Äù he added.

Strong US growth will be higher than forecast at 2.1% in 2024. The eurozone will act as a counterweight to the US after its growth rate was downgraded from 0.9% in 2024, at the time of November‚Äôs forecast, to 0.6%. The UK‚Äôs growth rate for this year was left unchanged at 0.7% and is still expected to recover to 1.2% in 2025. China is expected to be a significant barrier to global growth as it struggles to cope with high levels of corporate debt and a weak property market, the OECD said.

        "content": "The ownership team behind the indebted supermarket Asda could be about to change again after one of the billionaire Issa brothers was reported to be exploring the sale of his stake in the business. Zuber Issa, 51, owns 22.5% of the grocer after a ¬£6.8bn takeover alongside his older brother Mohsin and the private equity firm TDR Capital three years ago. He is said to be in discussions to sell his shares and instead focus on the pair‚Äôs petrol forecourt business EG Group, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Any attempts to sell his Asda shareholding are thought to be complicated by supposed lock-in agreements with Mohsin and TDR that would need all parties to agree to any deal. Zuber founded EG in 2001, bringing his brother onboard some years later, and the pair expanded the business to about 6,000 forecourts across 10 countries. Their success has seen them become business heroes in their home town of Blackburn, where they have emulated the former Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer by having a road named after them. However, the brothers have also attracted controversy, including for their construction of five identical hilltop mansions, ‚Äúwith spectacular countryside views over Bowland Fells‚Äù, which have been called the ‚ÄúFive Ugly Sisters‚Äù by local people. The reported move towards the Asda share sale has also emerged at what appears to be a tricky moment in the brothers‚Äô relationship. The breakdown of Mohsin‚Äôs marriage is said to have ‚Äúsent shockwaves‚Äù through the family, while the brothers have failed to bat away questions about the financing of their empire, having built a reputation as masters of debt-fuelled deals at EG. The Issas put just ¬£100m of cash into the initial Asda deal, matched by ¬£100m more from TDR Capital, with the remainder of the buyout funded with the largest sterling corporate bond sale on record, according to Bloomberg, as well as a loan from the parent company of EG Group. In October, in a move that appeared to blur the lines between the businesses even further, Asda announced it had acquired EG Group‚Äôs UK business for ¬£2bn. The supermarket group‚Äôs chair, Stuart Rose, said the acquisition would create a ‚Äúpowerful consumer champion‚Äù that was committed to being a ‚Äúprice leader‚Äù on fuel and the lowest price of the UK‚Äôs big four supermarkets on groceries. However, the deal was funded by an additional ¬£770m of loans and ¬£450m in new funds from the Issa brothers and their private-equity partner, TDR Capital. The Issa brothers were contacted by the Guardian but have not commented."

        "content": "The Treasury‚Äôs independent forecaster is to review the axeing of tax-free shopping for tourists, raising the possibility that a decision that leisure companies and retailers have blasted for deterring visitors and losing the UK billions in sales could be reversed.  With a change of heart likely to be seen as a shot in the arm for struggling businesses, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is to examine the costs and benefits associated with Rishi Sunak‚Äôs 2020 decision to end the retail scheme when he was chancellor of the exchequer. Richard Hughes, chair of the OBR, said the government spending watchdog plans to publish its conclusions alongside the budget next month. In a letter to Conservative backbench MP Sir Geoffrey Robert Clifton-Brown in December, he said: ‚ÄúWe will undertake this analysis in the first months of 2024 with an aim of publishing its conclusions alongside the spring budget.‚Äù The review, first reported in the Sunday Times, comes ‚Äúin the light of subsequent evidence on international visitor numbers and their consumption patterns and the analysis carried out by a number of outside bodies‚Äù, the letter added.  The Treasury has estimated that restoring VAT-free shopping will cost the exchequer ¬£2bn, but Hughes has said ‚Äúthis was not analysis undertaken by the OBR‚Äù. Last year, as part of an industry campaign to scrap the tax, the economics consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research said the removal of tax-free shopping was costing the UK economy ¬£10.7bn a year and deterring 2 million tourists annually. It added: ‚ÄúDespite our analysis showing clear economic benefits associated with a VAT refund scheme and demonstrating the analytical errors in the government‚Äôs calculations, the decision to terminate the scheme was upheld.‚Äù The ‚Äútourist tax‚Äù has even been blamed for contributing to the recent slump in the share price of Watches of Switzerland last month ‚Äì as the UK‚Äôs biggest seller of Rolex and Omega timepieces became the latest luxury retailer to experience reduced spending by aspirational shoppers. Not including the super-rich, US or Asian shoppers looking for a handbag or a luxury watch are more likely to allocate more of their budget to boutiques in Paris or Milan rather than London as a result, retailers claim. Last year, Gerry Murphy, chair of fashion group Burberry, criticised Sunak while the prime minister was attending a business event, saying that the then chancellor‚Äôs decision to remove tax-free shopping for tourists was ‚Äúsomewhat perverse‚Äù and a ‚Äúspectacular own goal‚Äù. Attempts to persuade the government to revisit the decision were renewed this weekend with the launch of a new campaign by Heathrow airport, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses. In a joint statement, the campaign urged the government to ‚Äúscrap the tourist tax‚Äù, arguing that ‚Äúalmost overnight, tourists saw prices hiked by 20% compared with this country‚Äôs closest European neighbours, delivering a blow to British businesses at a time when many were struggling to survive‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe reality is, every sale diverted from British tills to the European continent puts at risk the wages and livelihoods of thousands reliant on retail and the domestic side of its supply chain. ‚ÄúIt is not often that 400-plus businesses, more than 50 cross-party MPs and the regional mayors all agree, but on this occasion, everyone is aligned. The UK being the only country in Europe not to offer a proper tax-free shopping incentive to visitors makes the country an uncompetitive, unattractive place to spend and do business.‚Äù The Treasury said: ‚ÄúWe keep all taxes under review and recognise the value that retailers bring to Britain. That is why we announced a ¬£4.3bn business rates package at autumn statement to support businesses and the high street. ‚ÄúVAT-free shopping remains available for all non-UK visitors buying items in store and having them sent directly to their overseas address.‚Äù"

        "content": "Recent speculation over the possible loss of Saturday postal deliveries (Letters, 25 January) has led to a renewal of the debate in some circles regarding the relevance of pen-to-paper letter writing in this digital age. Will the use of crisp white writing pads, envelopes and ink at home soon be regarded in the same way as domestic breadmaking or needlepoint? (And yes, the irony of¬†this letter being sent via email is¬†not lost on me.) I am a firm champion of letter writing. However, my opinion is based on some 30 years of working as a prison officer and supporting offenders who had suddenly lost their ability to send digital messages via mobile devices or to make telephone calls at a time that was convenient for the recipient. All prisoners are entitled to send out at least one letter a week at public expense and I encouraged the use of the provision when supporting those in my care ‚Äì particularly those who were suffering as a result of missing contact with their loved ones. I also suggested that it was possible to use the process of writing to organise their thoughts and be able to communicate much more efficiently than in a rushed phone call at an inconvenient time. Today prisoners and their families enjoy a range of ways to keep in touch, including by censored email print-offs and video¬†calls, but the process of sitting down calmly, composing one‚Äôs thoughts and committing them to paper via a pen remains a powerful way of maintaining important family ties.Stuart HarringtonBurnham-on-Sea, Somerset ‚Ä¢ Do you have a photograph you‚Äôd like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "With ropes to manage queues and a team of security guards stationed at the door, the vibe at Sephora in west London‚Äôs Westfield White City shopping mall is more nightclub than beauty hall. But inside, rather than dancing and sipping drinks, women huddle around displays of eyeshadows, lipsticks and serums under signs promising the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and ‚Äúhot on social media‚Äù. Amid a cornucopia of 135 of the most sought-after cosmetics brands in the TikToksphere, two women are prostrate, towels over eyes, mid-facial at the ‚Äúface glow‚Äù bar. Selling cosmetics the Sephora way is an apparently winning formula even at a time when higher living costs are squeezing the disposable income of its predominantly female customer base. At its recent annual results, its owner, the French luxury goods empire LVMH, trumpeted the brand‚Äôs ‚Äúexceptional performance‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly successful‚Äù return to the UK. Although beloved of beauty gurus ‚Äì Guardian beauty columnist Sali Hughes says it‚Äôs her favourite global beauty retailer ‚Äì Sephora quit the UK in 2005, closing its handful of stores, after failing to make a dent in a cutthroat market. Now it‚Äôs back, its 2023 return met with huge fanfare. It started with two London shops in the giant Westfield malls that bookend London, west and east, and a third is due in Manchester‚Äôs Trafford Centre in the spring. More shops will follow, says Sarah Boyd, the UK managing director. ‚ÄúWe could not have asked for a stronger return to the UK,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOur debut store, White City, has become a destination to visit.‚Äù It will continue to open stores throughout the UK, she adds, so that ‚Äúeveryone can easily visit their favourite beauty playground‚Äù. Sephora is the ‚Äúmothership of the modern-day beauty industry‚Äù, claims Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at the marketing consultancy Interbrand. ‚ÄúIt oozes luxury but with an affordable price tag.‚Äù Last year, Sephora was the fastest-rising retailer in Interbrand‚Äôs annual Best Global Brands report. Interbrand, which assigns a dollar value to each brand based on factors such as financial performance and brand strength, said Sephora‚Äôs worth reached a brand value of $6.3bn (¬£5bn), up 15%. With more than 2,700 stores in 35 countries, the report said, it was a ‚Äúforce to be reckoned with in the retail space‚Äù.   Related: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm devastated it‚Äôs closing‚Äô: London shoppers say farewell to Fenwick   As the mass department store closures in the UK in recent year, not least the loss of Debenhams, bring down the curtain on the old beauty hall model, young shoppers appear to like Sephora‚Äôs laid-back self-service model ‚Äì what the industry calls ‚Äúopen-sell‚Äù ‚Äì even if the prices are just as high. Research shows it poses a threat to rivals Boots and Superdrug. Featuring loud music, beauty treatments and staff waving lip gloss wands, Sephora‚Äôs stores aim to be fun to visit. The beauty industry turns on a hunger for newness from consumers ‚Äúwho have 10 to 20 lipsticks they don‚Äôt necessarily use but they‚Äôve just wanted to try‚Äù, says Sara Hudson, a partner the consulting firm McKinsey. ‚ÄúMulti-brand stores drive a lot of that discovery, so we often call it a candy shop for adults.‚Äù Opening stores is a way of raising the brand‚Äôs profile and showcasing the latest brands, but market data shows the internet is now the most important beauty sales channel, ringing up ¬£2bn of the ¬£9.3bn Britons spent on themselves last year, according to McKinsey. Ahead of its UK entry, Sephora bought the British beauty website Feelunique for ¬£132m. It has since been subsumed into the Sephora website, which Boyd says is going from ‚Äústrength to strength‚Äù. In a world where browsing happens on phones rather than in beauty halls, Silverman says Sephora is better than rivals at engaging with customers online: ‚ÄúTheir social media and customer service are so tightly integrated, it feels like the brand is part of a customer‚Äôs personal network rather than just a store.‚Äù Analysts say Sephora‚Äôs work with up-and-coming brands and collaborations with high-profile influencers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube has helped the brand reach its target female audience of 24-36-year-olds. (Although the worrying flipside of this is that children as young as 10 are putting pressure on their parents to buy them expensive anti-ageing brands after seeing them on their social media feeds). Another part of the appeal is that Sephora is giving UK shoppers access to brands, such as Tarte cosmetics and Skinfix, that could not previously be bought in Britain. This meant buying from abroad and paying shipping fees, explains Tash Van Boxel, analyst at GlobalData. Now shoppers can ‚Äúbypass these added costs to access brands and products that are trending online‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis ensures appeal, particularly among younger shoppers.‚Äù"

        "content": "The UK government is poised to scrap the so-called ‚Äúboiler tax‚Äù after manufacturers hiked the price of new gas boilers to cover the fines they have to pay if new targets to fit eco-friendly heat pumps in homes are missed. The move, which will disappoint environmentalists, comes several months after Rishi Sunak announced a watering-down of the UK‚Äôs net-zero policies, a climbdown that included pushing back the deadline for banning new petrol and diesel cars. The targets, part of the government‚Äôs clean heat strategy, were drawn up to hasten the phasing-out of gas boilers and deliver 600,000 eco-friendly heat pump installations a year by 2028.   Related: ‚ÄòGreener, cheaper, much warmer‚Äô ‚Äì heat pump owners laud their new system   This means that from April, manufacturers of fossil fuel boilers face a quota for heat pump installations relative to their gas or oil boiler installations. Companies are required to match, or substitute, 4% of their boiler sales with heat pumps or face a fine of ¬£3,000 for every installation they fall short by. The Guardian reported last year that lobbyists for the gas boiler industry were trying to delay the new measures. Now Claire Coutinho, who became energy secretary in September, is reportedly minded to scrap the target and fines after concluding that it was bad for consumers. ‚ÄúBoiler manufacturers have saddled families with indefensible price hikes ‚Äì this is not right,‚Äù a government source told the Sunday Times. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking again at the policy, and expect manufacturers to do the right thing and remove their price hikes immediately.‚Äù In readiness for the new targets, manufacturers started pushing up prices last year. In September, Worcester Bosch, the UK‚Äôs biggest manufacturer, told the Times its prices were going up by as much as ¬£300 because the UK market for heat pumps was not yet at sufficient scale, which meant it was ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù that it would face fines. A formal decision has not been announced, but according to the report, Coutinho believes ditching the policy may be the only way to get manufacturers to drop their prices again and that the government can still hit its target of 600,000 heat pumps through other schemes and incentives. ‚ÄúWe remain committed to our ambition of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028,‚Äù said a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson when approached for comment. ‚ÄúWe want to do this in a way that does not burden consumers, and we‚Äôve increased our heat pump grants by 50% to ¬£7,500 ‚Äì making it one of the most generous schemes in Europe. ‚ÄúThis pragmatic approach is working, with a nearly 50% increase in people applying in December 2023 compared to the same month in 2022.‚Äù"

Why? Because of theft! ‚ÄúNot only is it easy to steal from self-checkout machines, it can be hard not to steal from them,‚Äù writes Germain. ‚ÄúShoppers are reportedly 21 times more likely to sneak items past machines than human cashiers.‚Äù But it‚Äôs not all your fault. Small merchants and big retail are also to blame for the debacle that is self-checkout. They‚Äôre the ones who invested too much time and money in these confounding machines and they‚Äôre the ones that have had to spend more money and deploy the army of peeved high schoolers to come to monitor your every move or come to the rescue and, with a sigh, punch in their secret codes for the trillionth time that day. The strange thing about self-checkout is that for all its humiliations, people like it. One survey from last year found nearly two-thirds of respondents preferred it to human interactions. Retailers facing labor shortages and higher costs like it too. These technologies will continue to come down in price and be more reliable. Ultimately, even the smallest of retailers will be able to offer this option. But in the meantime, many are just doing what my local grocery market does. They‚Äôre sticking to manual checkout. Why? Because in a neighborhood market, merchants know their customers. They don‚Äôt want to make you feel dumb or dodgy. And they don‚Äôt care how you spell ‚Äúprosciutto‚Äù."

        "content": "The Treasury‚Äôs decision to appoint the head of the City regulators‚Äô watchdog has been thrown into controversy after campaigners accused the newly installed commissioner of being unfit because of conflicts of interest. Positive Money is concerned that the financial regulators complaints commissioner, Rachel Kent, could struggle to remain independent, given that she will continue to advise the government and financial services bosses on behalf of the City law firm Hogan Lovells. Kent, who took the commissioner role last month, has given up her position as a partner at Hogan Lovells, but is staying on part-time as a senior consultant on its financial services regulatory team, which advises banks, insurers and investment and wealth managers. Positive Money says this poses a conflict of interest, because she will be responsible for handling complaints, including from City firms, against the sector‚Äôs three regulators: the Financial Conduct Authority, the Payment Systems Regulator and the Prudential Regulation Authority.   Related: UK‚Äôs credit unions face uncertain future amid cost of living crisis   ‚ÄúTasking a lawyer who remains in the employment of a business serving financial firms with judging those same firms‚Äô complaints against regulators, creates a clear conflict of interest,‚Äù Fran Boait, co-executive director at Positive Money, said. It is the first time that the government has appointed the commissioner, who until this year had been selected by the trio of regulators. The government gave itself the powers to take over the appointment as part of the wide-ranging Financial Services and Markets Act, passed in the summer. Kent has defended her position, telling Positive Money in a letter last month that she ‚Äúmade various changes to my arrangements to take proper account of conflicts and the perception of conflicts. I did this in discussion with HM Treasury who appointed me‚Äù. She said that in the case of a conflict, the Treasury had the ability to appoint a temporary replacement to deal with select cases. She also stressed that her position at Hogan Lovells was publicly disclosed, and that none of her pay in the role came directly from regulated financial firms. Positive Money said this was splitting hairs, and that ultimately her salary would come from Hogan Lovells‚Äô own clients, which include regulated firms. It also questioned whether this would affect Kent‚Äôs ability to reach objective decisions on whether complaints were justified. Kent‚Äôs pay at Hogan Lovells is not disclosed but is likely to exceed the salary she earns at the commission, where her predecessor took home ¬£129,000 last year, according to its latest annual report. Kent also noted in her letter that most of her consulting work at Hogan Lovells would involve advising the ‚ÄúUK government and related entities‚Äù. Positive Money said this posed additional conflicts, given that the government had recently given regulators a new responsibility to promote economic growth and international competitiveness. Leading economists and former politicians have said the new ‚Äúobjective‚Äù risks watering down regulation and recreating the conditions that led to the 2008 banking crash.Boait said the potential conflict ‚Äúwould pile on more pressure for lax regulation and watered-down standards ‚Ä¶ with the public paying the price‚Äù and called on Kent to resign from her other roles. ‚ÄúEither Kent must drop these conflicts of interest, or the government must find someone else for the job if she is unwilling to do so.‚Äù The Treasury said: ‚ÄúRachel is a highly experienced candidate who was appointed through a robust process. As part of her appointment, she has stepped down as a partner at Hogan Lovells and will not benefit from or provide advice to regulated firms while in the role.‚Äù The Guardian attempted to contact Kent for comment."

        "content": "Eurostar could be forced to limit passenger numbers travelling from St Pancras each day under post-Brexit plans to bring in biometric border controls later this year, the owner of the station has warned. HS1, the owner and operator of the line and stations between London and the Channel tunnel, has raised concerns that planning for new Entry/Exit System (EES) checks at the London rail station are ‚Äúseverely inadequate‚Äù, and would lead to long delays and potential capping of services and passenger numbers. The EES requires citizens from outside the EU or Schengen area to register before entering the zone.   Related: Eurostar passenger numbers back to pre-Covid levels   This will replace the stamping of passports for UK travellers, and instead require passengers to enter personal information and details about their trip, as well as submitting fingerprint and facial biometric data. It has been mooted that the new checks will come into force in October but the implementation has been delayed several times in recent years because the infrastructure was not ready. HS1 has now raised several concerns to MPs around St Pancras‚Äôs ability to accommodate the changes, predicting ‚Äúunacceptable passenger delays‚Äù. It said only 24 EES kiosks had been allocated by the French government, despite modelling suggesting that nearly 50 would be needed at peak times. In evidence to the European scrutiny select committee, it wrote: ‚ÄúWe are told that the proposed kiosks are ‚Äòoptional‚Äô as the process can be delivered at the border, but without about 49 additional kiosks located before the current international zone [at St Pancras] there would be unacceptable passenger delays of many hours and potential capping of services.‚Äù It predicted that with just 24 kiosks, Eurostar would be unable to process all passengers, particularly at the morning peak, and this could ‚Äúlead to services having to be capped in terms of passenger numbers‚Äù. Eurostar runs about 14 trains to Paris from St Pancras a day, with each train carrying up to 900 passengers. HS1 has said space restrictions at the Grade I-listed St Pancras building would make the EES difficult to implement and that a lack of space would mean the queueing process would be ‚Äúconvoluted and staggered‚Äù. In its own evidence to the committee, Eurostar said kiosks would create new queues and a more complex flow management that would represent a ‚Äúhigher risk for the delivery of the timetable and the growth of rail transport from St Pancras‚Äù. It suggested this would add ‚Äútwo to three minutes‚Äù to the time taken to process travellers through the border, significantly higher than the 45 seconds it now takes, and could lead to queues of over an hour at peak times. Any extra kiosks at St Pancras would need to be funded by Eurostar, at about ¬£25,000 a kiosk, with the operator also paying an expected ¬£2m in operation and maintenance costs for all of the kiosks each year. The Eurostar chief executive, Gwendoline Cazenave, said she hoped the authorities would allow most of the process to happen in advance online, rather than entirely under the supervision of border police. The concerns over delays at St Pancras, the country‚Äôs main Eurostar terminal, mirror those of port operators and local authorities. Last week, Ashford borough council, which has the M20 running through its area, told the committee 14-hour queues were ‚Äúa reasonable worst-case‚Äù scenario if the scheme was implemented as planned. The Port of Dover has also suggested reclaiming land from the sea to allow it more space to process the EES border controls. In its evidence to the committee, Eurostar called for an ‚Äúemergency brake mechanism‚Äù to be established, which could be triggered by politicians if the EES led to permanently longer queues and traffic. It also suggested the EU and UK consider bespoke agreements, which would mean UK nationals being exempted from the collection and verification of biometric records. Last January, Eurostar was forced to cap passenger numbers for several months due to border police being unable to process passports quickly enough. In some cases up to one-third of the 900 seats were left unsold on services between London, Paris and Brussels, because the company could not deal with post-Brexit rules that required each UK passport to be stamped. The cap was fully lifted in October last year. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 7 February 2024 to remove an incorrect reference that Ashford borough council is ‚Äúresponsible for the area around the Port of Dover‚Äù. The area is the responsibility of Dover district council."

        "content": "Tough choices. We must be willing to make tough choices. It is a soundbite heard frequently from politicians, often accompanied by another chestnut: there‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch. Both statements are true. Free lunches are few and far between. There are tough choices that need to be made. But, like most other developed countries in similar circumstances, Britain is reluctant to make them. Tough choices implies a willingness to make sacrifices and that doesn‚Äôt fit well with the west‚Äôs ‚ÄúI want it all now‚Äù culture. Politicians pander to this. They talk about the need to make tough choices but in fact look for the soft option, because that‚Äôs what keeps the punters happy. The debate over immigration is a case in point. Migration is a hot topic here, as it is in Germany, France, the Netherlands and the US. What‚Äôs more, it is certain to remain a salient political issue. Last week, the Office for National Statistics published its latest projections for the size of the UK‚Äôs population. These showed the number of people living in the UK rising to 70 million by 2026 ‚Äì a decade earlier than previously envisaged ‚Äì and continuing to increase over the following decade to 73.7 million. Net migration ‚Äì the number of people entering the UK minus the number leaving ‚Äì is expected to account for more than 90% of the 6.6 million increase in the population between 2021 and 2036. Just to be clear, these are not ONS forecasts but rather projections based on net migration of 315,000 from 2028 onwards. This would be much lower than the record 672,000 in the year to June 2023 but significantly higher than in any previous period. When Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, for example, net migration was 48,000. When David Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010 the figure stood at 256,000. One response to these projections is to say: what‚Äôs the problem? If people from other parts of the world want to come here then they are welcome to come. Migration is globalisation in action: workers from poor countries seeking out job opportunities in countries where they can earn higher wages and enjoy better living standards. Migrants can make the economy grow faster and they do the jobs home-born workers are reluctant to do. Without migrant workers the care system would collapse and NHS waiting lists would be even longer than they are already. Without foreign students, the higher education system would be in deep financial trouble. Given the UK‚Äôs ageing population, it makes no economic sense to put an arbitrary limit on net migration. Let‚Äôs assume all the above is correct. Put to one side the fact that much higher levels of net migration have coincided with only weak growth in per capita incomes. Whether or not migration is good for growth, if the UK‚Äôs population is to increase on the scale envisaged over the next decade or so, then this country will have to be prepared to build (and pay for) the infrastructure to service a much-expanded citizenry. That means more schools, more hospitals, more capacity on the transport network and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì more houses. The current level of homes built in the UK is about half that of its postwar peak of 425,000 recorded in 1968, a time when the population was 12 million smaller than it is today and 19 million smaller than it is expected to be by the mid-2030s. The supply of homes is already insufficient to meet existing demands and those pressures are only going to increase if the ONS projections are right. And that means, you guessed it, tough choices. If housing supply is to keep up with demand it will mean liberalising the planning rules. It might even involve building on the green belt. It will certainly lead to a struggle between whoever is in government and those who think demand can be met simply by developing brownfield sites. The consequences of a 10% increase in the population without a significant increase in the supply of new homes are obvious: rampant house-price inflation; more overcrowding; ever-higher numbers of children living with their parents into their 30s; more people squeezed into private-rented accommodation, and a growing divide between the housing haves and the housing have nots. So how about some serious immigration controls instead? Wouldn‚Äôt they be an alternative to concreting over the green belt? In theory, yes. It was not so long ago that annual net migration hovered around zero. In 1990 and 1991, for example, it averaged 40,000 a year; in the following two years it fell by 6,000 a year on average. In practice, of course, returning to those levels of net migration would also have consequences. Care homes would need to charge more to attract UK-born workers. Universities would no longer be able to use the fees from foreign students to subsidise those from the UK. Businesses that have come to rely on migrant workers would become unviable. Again, one response would be: so what? If the business model of care homes relies on cheap foreign labour and that of universities relies on expensive foreign students then there is something wrong with those business models. But while the long-term solution might well be a different economic model ‚Äì higher wage, higher productivity, more highly automated ‚Äì getting to that better world will not be easy or cost-free. It means either higher taxes to pay for higher levels of public spending or higher prices for consumers, and quite possibly both. So there‚Äôs a choice that has to be made: embrace high levels of net migration and fundamentally rethink housing; or reduce net migration to late 20th-century levels and fundamentally rethink the economy. It can‚Äôt be ducked."

The true blame lies with the 40%-plus reduction in the central government grant to councils imposed by George Osborne under the 2010 coalition government, and which has continued. In their desperation, councils resort to all manner of ways of making money, which only serve to make them unpopular. Now, I am familiar with the observation that people have a natural preference for tax cuts they can feel rather than public spending increases whose benefits to them are somewhat amorphous. Nevertheless, recent surveys suggest that public anger over the dilapidated state of the public services is so intense that the majority would prefer Hunt to desist from trying to appease the lunatic right, and take decisions that actually alleviate the pressures on the public weal. However, the chancellor has toned down his promises on the tax cut front. In addition to the limitations on his freedom of manoeuvre likely to be placed by the Office for Budget Responsibility, he must have taken fright at a wild front page story in the Mail on Sunday recently. This was promising a ‚ÄúLawson boom‚Äù tax-cutting bonanza, but Jeremy Hunt is old enough to remember how the Lawson boom of 1988 ended in one of the worst recessions since the second world war, and the pound‚Äôs ignominious ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992.   I find a disconcerting number of natural Labour sympathisers are not so sympathetic about the leadership‚Äôs ultra-defensive tactics   The combination of the government‚Äôs cynical approach to the public spending crisis and its insouciant attitude towards the manifest economic and social harm wreaked by Brexit makes me long for the British public to voice the kind of ‚Äúsavage indignation‚Äù expressed about other matters by the Roman poet Juvenal. As the bureaucracy associated with the latest stage of Brexit negotiations takes effect, making life harder for exporters and importers ‚Äì and guaranteeing delays and higher prices ‚Äì some Brexiters are beginning to run for cover. I was surprised when my friend the Keynesian economist Roger Bootle opted for Brexit. His latest column in the Daily Telegraph was headlined ‚ÄúNo, Brexit was not a terrible mistake‚Äù. But the article sounded defensive ‚Äì almost apologetic. He concluded: ‚ÄúAdmittedly, if the UK makes a mess of its independence while the EU gets its act together, then we will have paid a not inconsiderable price for our exit.‚Äù He says that ‚Äúon the balance of the evidence that is unlikely. But only time will tell.‚Äù Well, I think it is pretty obvious that time has already told. Our act of self-harm has not yet reached the stage which, according to Plutarch, led Caesar to abandon his conquest of Britain because ‚Äúthe islanders were so miserably poor that they had nothing worth left to plunder‚Äù. But a succession of recent governments has been working on it. As for Labour, I find that a disconcerting number of natural Labour sympathisers are not so sympathetic to the leadership‚Äôs ultra-defensive tactics. This applies to everything from the open goal of Brexit to the thorny subject of bankers‚Äô bonuses. Labour‚Äôs concentration on relatively peripheral issues calls to mind Proust‚Äôs passage in Swann‚Äôs Way about Charles Swann‚Äôs approach to life: ‚ÄúThus he had grown into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which enabled him to disregard matters of fundamental¬†importance.‚Äù I am told it will all be very different when ‚Äì or if ‚Äì they win the election. Let us hope so! Meanwhile, they are even backtracking on such important initiatives as their ¬£28bn green investment plan and taking fright at Neil Kinnock‚Äôs well-thought-out wealth tax proposal, calculated not to frighten the horses or even wealthy horse owners. This is a different kettle of fish from the question of changes to inheritance tax, the possibility of which seems to be worrying the Tories. However, I have said it before and I shall say it again: the revenues lost to the hit from Brexit will severely constrain a Labour chancellor. We need the single market!"

        "content": "Tim Fisher stands with his arms on his hips, inspecting the bins in front of him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a bit of hit and miss,‚Äù he says, digging through the mountains of disposed food on a muggy night in Sydney‚Äôs inner west. ‚ÄúYou never know what you‚Äôll find ‚Äì some of it is obviously about opposing waste and consumption, but some of it is the thrill of the chase.‚Äù   Related: Anthony Albanese announces year-long investigation into supermarket prices by ACCC   Fisher has come equipped with plastic tubs, tongs, bags and hand sanitiser ‚Äì and a sense of what to look for. He‚Äôs part of a growing community of dumpster divers in Sydney who share tips and locations on private Facebook groups. Many are people looking to dumpster dive for the first time, interested in the practice as a way to live more ethically.  Sign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Grocery prices and supermarket profit margins have been under intense scrutiny amid an ongoing cost of living crisis. In January, prime minister Anthony Albanese announced supermarkets would be targeted in an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry. For Fisher, dumpster diving is less about saving money, and more about reducing supermarket waste. ‚ÄúIt comes from a distaste for these supermarket giants, but it‚Äôs also altruistic in a way. We share locations with people, support food pantries and always leave food for others.‚Äù ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not an archaeologist‚Äô On this particular night, there‚Äôs a bounty. Fisher finds bread, fresh vegetables, dried and frozen meat, cheese and tubs of yoghurt.   I feel a responsibility, to the food I have and the mountains of food I find  Sahar    There‚Äôs so much that Fisher doesn‚Äôt need to search too hard to find anything to take home. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt dig too deep, I‚Äôm not an archaeologist like some other divers,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs also about leaving some stuff for others, we know lots of people come through here, so we just take what we need and leave the rest. As you can see, there is enough here for everyone.‚Äù At a second location, a security guard politely but firmly insists there isn‚Äôt any edible food in the bins. Fisher shrugs and walks away. Dumpster diving is a legal grey area, with police in all states and territories saying it could be considered trespassing ‚Äì although none could provide data on charges relating to dumpster diving. Fisher ends the night with half a cabbage, blueberry muffins, flowers for his wife and a packet of frozen schnitzels, all found in one bin. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúlight haul‚Äù he says ‚Äì it‚Äôs not something he desperately needs to do, but something he feels is the right thing to do. Fisher goes dumpster diving multiple times a week ‚Äì he says Monday, Wednesday and Friday are best. He‚Äôs still not used to seeing so much edible food thrown out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very frustrating,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI saw a bin last night that was just jam-packed with stuff that was due to expire multiple days later.‚Äù Australia wastes 7.6m tonnes of food each year, about 70% of which is edible. The latest Foodbank hunger report showed that 3.7m households reported food insecurity in the last 12 months. About 10% of food waste is related to the cosmetic standards imposed on fruit and vegetable growers by retailers, according to the Australia Institute‚Äôs food waste in Australia report. ‚ÄúIt is astonishing how much [supermarkets] throw out, how much they waste,‚Äù Fisher says. ‚ÄúIt might be metrics and processes for us, but this is food they are throwing out.‚Äù ‚ÄòName an item, and I‚Äôve found it discarded‚Äô Amy Booth, 29, has been dumpster diving in Hobart for five years. She says she consistently finds so much food that she no longer needs to go grocery shopping. ‚ÄúThere is always fruit and veg available, and it‚Äôs obviously seasonal as well. But we also get dairy products, cheeses, coffee, even eggs sometimes.‚Äù ‚ÄúName an item, and I‚Äôve found it discarded.‚Äù She says she is now ‚Äúdesensitised‚Äù to the amount of food she finds. ‚ÄúWhen I first started, I used to see the piles and piles of food and just be shocked by it. But now, this is how I get my food, so I open the bins and think I‚Äôm in for a treat now‚Äô. She says that saving money is a part of why she goes, but it isn‚Äôt the only reason. For her, the ethics and behaviour of major supermarket chains is also a major factor. It‚Äôs a perspective echoed by Sahar, who runs a Facebook and Instagram page called Food Bounty that shares large hauls from dumpster diving and allows people to pick up some of the items for free. The page is meant to be an easy way to share food and prevent waste. Sahar, who asked to remain anonymous, insists it‚Äôs about more than just saving money. ‚ÄúI feel a responsibility, to the food I have and the mountains of food I find. And so what I do is take a photo and share it with other dumpster divers I know who live in the area, and we coordinate ourselves and encourage more communication, so we all share the dive between us.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn many ways, it is about community. The page and its work is an opportunity to share and communicate with the people living around us.‚Äù Waste not, want not Sahar says it is ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù just how much food she finds in the bins ‚Äì she finds the wastage ‚Äúethically wrong‚Äù. She also says security measures implemented to prevent dumpster divers at some locations are ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen security guards at late hours ‚Äì even up to four in the morning ‚Äì telling me I had to leave, and it just makes me wonder why they are investing so much money in this. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre investing money in saving products that they‚Äôve discarded. It‚Äôs just disgusting.‚Äù A spokesperson for Woolworths said the supermarket giant has a policy of locking bins they manage, and that they ‚Äúwork hard to reduce waste‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe aim to only discard food that can‚Äôt be donated to charity, often for food safety reasons. ‚ÄúEvery one of our stores has a partnership with a local hunger relief organisation, passing on any food that can‚Äôt be sold, but is still safe to eat.‚Äù Last year, Woolworths group diverted 80% of their food waste from landfill and donated the ‚Äúequivalent of 28m meals to our hunger relief partners to help feed Australians in need‚Äù, they said. Coles said they ‚Äúdo not want‚Äù food to go to waste. ‚ÄúLast financial year we donated nearly 20,000 tonnes ‚Äì the equivalent of more than 39m meals ‚Äì of unsold edible food to food rescue organisations SecondBite and Foodbank. ‚ÄúWe have other food-waste solutions, including donations to farmers and animal or wildlife services, organics collections and in-store food-waste disposal equipment.‚Äù   Related: Instead of pursuing shoplifters, the big supermarkets should use their record profits to prevent food waste | Drew Rooke    They also said they strongly discouraged anyone from dumpster diving because there can be trucks moving about in the area. When asked if the supermarkets‚Äô donation drives were enough to offset the waste, Fisher waves dismissively, and points to the piles of still-sealed food in front of him. ‚ÄúHow can it be enough? Look at all this, it‚Äôs all still edible.‚Äù"

        "content": "BP is poised this week to reveal a set of financial results that the City believes will show a halving of profits compared with the year before ‚Äì but this isn‚Äôt the oil company‚Äôs biggest¬†problem. BP has emerged from an embarrassing misconduct scandal with a new leadership team, but questions remain about its future strategy, and pressure is growing for the board to abandon its green commitments and increase production of fossil fuels. Last week, it was revealed that a small London-based hedge fund, Bluebell Capital Partners, had written to the company to warn against locking itself into a future of falling fossil fuel production. The 30-page letter was sent shortly after the activist fund acquired a small stake in BP last October, just weeks after the company‚Äôs future was thrown into doubt following the shock exit of Bernard Looney, its former chief executive. Looney, the architect of BP‚Äôs net zero commitments, resigned after admitting last September that he had failed to fully disclose to the board a series of personal relationships with his colleagues. In early 2020, his green commitments included a pledge to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. Even Looney could not resist calls to water down the plan to target a 25% decline after a surge in global energy market prices in the wake of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years later. But so far Looney‚Äôs successor, Murray Auchincloss, has insisted that there will be no changes to BP‚Äôs strategic direction. The company‚Äôs former chief financial officer faces a difficult decision: on the one hand, a significant number of shareholders are understood to be eager to seize the opportunity presented by a change of leadership to steer BP back towards familiar territory and away from the riskier prospect of large green energy projects. On the other hand, BP has already sunk billions into a series of ventures ‚Äì most notably some eye-wateringly expensive offshore windfarm projects ‚Äì which to an extent has locked the company into a greener trajectory. Auchincloss can no doubt be only too aware of BP‚Äôs lagging share price relative to its rivals in recent years, which many blame on the company‚Äôs green agenda. BP‚Äôs shares are trading broadly in line with pre-pandemic levels, but by contrast ExxonMobil‚Äôs share price has surged by about 40% over the period. In setting a path for BP, Auchincloss may find it more useful to look to the future rather than the recent past. Energy market prices may have rewarded polluters in the two years since Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine ignited a global energy crisis. But uncertainty over the future demand for fossil fuels has already triggered a rethink among some of the market‚Äôs most powerful players. In recent weeks, the governments behind of the world‚Äôs biggest energy exporting nations have signalled big policy changes that could prove to be the beginning of the end for fossil fuel¬†growth. Saudi Arabia, the world‚Äôs biggest exporter of oil, ordered its state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco to halt a multibillion-dollar campaign to increase the kingdom‚Äôs maximum production capacity by 1m barrels of oil a day to 13m barrels a day by 2027. The reason? Its full oil export potential is already underused. Saudi Arabia produced about 9m barrels of oil a day last year, well below its maximum daily capacity of 12m, in order to help prop up global market prices, which have drifted lower in the years since Russia‚Äôs war began. The faltering global economy is expected to slow the growing demand for oil from this year, before the take-up of electric vehicles in the second half of the decade causes consumption to reach a peak, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).   Related: Biden‚Äôs delay of ‚Äòcarbon bomb‚Äô projects could be a big deal ‚Äì but will it last?   The decision emerged a week after Joe Biden‚Äôs administration said it would hit the brakes on the US‚Äôs surging exports of gas. The US, the world‚Äôs biggest exporter of gas last year, announced that it was pausing all pending export permits for liquified natural gas until it could come up with an updated criteria for approving new gas export projects that consider the impact of the climate crisis. Government officials in Washington may also be responding to the same market signals now shaping policy in Riyadh.The global gas market already has enough gas export terminals, either operating or in construction, to meet the world‚Äôs gas demand until 2050 - even if there is no increase in climate action over the decades ahead, according to the IEA. And as renewable energy claims an ever greater share of electricity generation the need for gas-fired power is likely to fall. Auchincloss may find that Looney‚Äôs strategy pays off in the end."

Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank, explains:   The strength of the US labour market continues to undermine the market‚Äôs view that interest rates will be cut soon and sharply. Job and wage growth, once again, were both stronger than expected, and the unemployment rate was lower.

Gains were well spread over sectors, more broadly than just government and healthcare sectors of recent months. The household measure of employment was weaker and showed marked divergence from the establishment survey.  Yet declines in labour supply meant unemployment remained low at 3.7% Average earnings provided a further surprise, rising by 0.6% m/m, up 5.4% (3m annualised). Despite focus on good inflation progress to date, the Fed cannot afford to ignore this robust performance.  This adds to our view that the Fed will not ease policy until June this year, and will cut four times, rather than the five still priced by markets across the course of this year.       4.04pm GMT   January‚Äôs jobs report shows the highest number of new jobs in a year, as Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, shows here:  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!

If March wasn‚Äôt off the table as far as rate cuts were concerned before today‚Äôs payroll numbers, it‚Äôs not even in the same room now. That said this wasn‚Äôt bad news for US markets given that the prospect of a recession looks even further away than ever, but also means that on an economic basis a resilient US economy should mean company earnings hold up. It also helps to explain why even though the S&P500 gave up most of its premarket gains, it still managed to open higher, along with the Nasdaq 100.      3.35pm GMT   In another boost, US consumer sentiment soared in January to its highest level in two and a half years. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index has risen by 9.3 points in January to 79.0, the highest since July 2021.

The average number of hours worked fell by 0.2 to 34.1, its lowest since March 2020. This may be because many of the jobs created were part time positions, or by because demand for labour weakened‚Ä¶  - A big drop in the work week to just 34.1 hours, the lowest number since 2010 outside of the pandemic recession.

Cooler employment figures would imply lower inflationary pressures, potentially paving the way for rate cuts. And while lower interest rates would surely be welcomed, it is becoming increasingly clear that markets and the economy are coping well with the high rate environment, so investors are perhaps feeling that the need for monetary policy to ease is less urgent.

Yesterday, the BoE‚Äôs policymakers were split three ways on monetary policy, with two voting to raise interest rates, one pushing for a cut, and the other six deciding rates should remain at 5.25%. The Bank appears to be inching towards a rate cut fairly soon; it wants more evidence that inflation will fall back to its 2% and then stay there. The City money markets predict the first rate cut will come by June, but that there‚Äôs a 10% possibility it might be as early as March. So, I asked ChatGPT when the Bank might cut rates ‚Äì and it provided some situations under which monetary policy could be eased:  Economic Downturn: If there is a significant economic downturn or recession, the Bank of England may lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing, spending, and investment. Lower interest rates can encourage consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, thereby boosting economic activity. Inflation Below Target: If inflation is consistently below the target set by the central bank, it may choose to cut interest rates to encourage spending and investment, which can help push inflation towards the target. Global Economic Uncertainty: External factors, such as global economic uncertainty or financial market turbulence, can also influence the Bank of England‚Äôs decisions. Cutting interest rates in such situations can be a preemptive measure to support the economy and financial stability. Exchange Rate Considerations: The central bank may also consider the impact of interest rate changes on the exchange rate. Lower interest rates may lead to a depreciation of the currency, which can benefit exports and contribute to economic growth. Credit Conditions: If there are signs of tightening credit conditions that could restrict borrowing and investment, the central bank might lower interest rates to make borrowing more attractive and accessible. Unemployment Concerns: If there are concerns about rising unemployment, the central bank might use interest rate cuts to stimulate economic activity and job creation.      7.59am GMT   The UK government doesn‚Äôt accept the claim that it is ‚Äútoo focused on a narrow view of AI safety‚Äù, as the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee warns.

In a major report on artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) ‚Äì which power generative AI tools such as ChatGPT ‚Äì the committee say the technology would produce era-defining changes comparable with the invention of the internet. However, it warned that the UK needed to rebalance its approach to the subject to also consider the opportunities AI can offer, otherwise it will lose its international influence and become strategically dependent on overseas tech firms for a technology which is expected to play a key role in daily life in the years to come. It said that some of the ‚Äúapocalyptic‚Äù concerns around threats to human existence from AI were exaggerated, and should not distract policy makers from responding to more immediate issues. Baroness Stowell of Beeston, Chairman of the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee, said:  The rapid development of AI Large Language Models is likely to have a profound effect on society, comparable to the introduction of the internet. That makes it vital for the Government to get its approach right and not miss out on opportunities ‚Äì particularly not if this is out of caution for far-off and improbable risks.

After leaving UK interest rates on hold at 5.25% yesterday, Andrew Bailey has said human workers will learn to work with new technologies. Bailey told the BBC that history shows the benefits of new technology:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an economic historian, before I became a central banker. Economies adapt, jobs adapt, and we learn to work with it. And I think, you get a better result by people with machines than with machines on their own. So I‚Äôm an optimist‚Ä¶‚Äù  Policymakers globally are grappling with the consequences of generative AI ‚Äì for the jobs market, but also its potential to generate misinformation (not forgetting its habit of ‚Äúhallucinating‚Äù and generating nonsense). Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned that almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI, requiring safety nets to protect those who lose out.   Related: AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality, says IMF head   The BoE itself is concerned that rapid developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning could pose risks to the UK‚Äôs financial stability; last December it launched a new review into their use across the City.   Related: Bank of England warns AI could pose financial stability risks   Many businesses have been flocking to implement AI tech such as chatbots, with nearly a third telling the BOE they have made significant AI investments in the past year. This week‚Äôs flurry of financial results from tech giants has shown the impact. Microsoft reported a 30% increase in revenues at its Azure plarform on Tuesday night, with artificial intelligence giving 6 percentage point boost. Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft, declared:  We‚Äôve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.‚Äù    Related: Microsoft‚Äôs Activision acquisition and bets on AI yield high quarterly revenue   But both Microsoft and Google warned that costs are rising as they race to develop cutting-edge AI products. Also coming up today The health of the US jobs market is also in focus today, as investors await the latest jobs report from the states. Investors expect a small slowdown in job creation; January‚Äôs non-farm payroll is expected to show 180 new jobs were created, down from the 216,000 in December. Average hourly earnings are seen rising 0.3% month-on-month (or 4.1% year-on-year). A strong jobs report would ease concerns that the US economy is slowing, but could also sink hopes that US interest rates would be cut as soon as March. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains:  A reasonably weak number should revive the Federal Reserve (Fed) doves, while a strong number should melt the March rate cut expectations. The probability of a March hike fell to 35% after the Fed said [on Wednesday] that March was probably too early to cut rates ‚Äì while this probability was around 80% at the start of the year. Everyone is focused on the May meeting now, with more than 90% probability priced in for the first Fed cut.

        "content": "Joe Biden declared the strong jobs figures released on Friday as proof that ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs economy is the strongest in the world‚Äù. The US jobs market defied fears of a downturn again, when figures were released on growth in January, with employers adding 353,000 new jobs over the month, the labor department announced. The jobs market has remained strong despite an aggressive series of interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve, aimed at cooling the economy and bringing down the rate of inflation. In January the unemployment rate was 3.7%, close to a 50-year low. Economists had been predicting that the US would add less than 200,000 jobs over the month. The labor department also revised its job gains for December up from an initial estimate of 216,000 to 333,000. The news was another boost to the US president, whose polling on the economy has remained weak despite the robust jobs market. Hiring was broad-based with gains in healthcare, government, professional and business services and retail. Biden pointed out that the US has added almost 15m jobs since he was sworn in in January 2021. In a statement from the White House, Biden said: ‚ÄúToday, we saw more proof, with another month of strong wage gains and employment gains of over 350,000 in January, continuing the strong growth from last year ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs great news for working families that wages, wealth and jobs are higher now than before the pandemic, and I won‚Äôt stop fighting to lower costs and build an economy from the middle out and bottom up.‚Äù He further said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll continue to stand in the way of efforts by congressional Republicans to enact massive tax giveaways for the wealthy and big corporations; cut Medicare, Medicaid and social security; and raise costs for American families.‚Äù But there have been signs recently that the strong labor market is weakening. On Wednesday, ADP, the US‚Äôs largest payroll supplier, said private employers had added 107,000 new jobs in January, less than analysts expected and down from 158,000 in December. Several large employers have also announced layoffs recently, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, PayPal and UPS. The US added 2.7m jobs last year even as the Fed drove interest rates up to a 22-year high. This week, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the US economy remained resilient and the rate of inflation ‚Äì which has fallen from a high of just over 9% in June 2022 to 3.4% in December ‚Äì was moving in the right direction. But the Fed is still targeting an annual rate of inflation of 2%. Powell warned: ‚ÄúInflation is still too high, the ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.‚Äù The latest jobs report will add pressure for the Fed to maintain its current interest rates. ‚ÄúThe big picture for now is that markets are no longer convinced that the Fed will cut rates in May, let alone March,‚Äù Capital Economics said in a note."

        "content": "The boss of Jaguar Land Rover has called on ministers to increase spending on policing to prevent car thefts rather than making tax cuts, after the Range Rover maker was hit by a wave of thefts of its luxury vehicles. Adrian Mardell, the British carmaker‚Äôs chief executive, said: ‚ÄúI would rather funds be put towards this rather than tax cuts next year. This is important to so many people. It goes to the fabric of the society we‚Äôre in. We‚Äôve got to sort this out.‚Äù Insurance premiums for JLR‚Äôs luxury vehicles have soared, prompting the company to relaunch its own insurance cover last October. Some insurers have refused to cover Range Rovers. The company, which is owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, is spending more than ¬£15m updating 450,000 older vehicles with new security software, and has installed it on 80,000 so far. ‚ÄúThe theft rates of those enhanced vehicles are as low as the new vehicles,‚Äù Mardell said. ‚ÄúSpeed of delivery, that is a problem. Many of these customers we don‚Äôt know because they‚Äôre second and third sales.‚Äù Of the 12,800 vehicles of the latest Range Rover sold since its launch two years ago, only 11 have been stolen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to make it more difficult for gangs and people to operate,‚Äù Mardell said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre partly funding police security at the ports because there isn‚Äôt enough. The containers are not being checked, and they get out of the country.‚Äù The comments came as the firm reported its highest quarterly profit since 2017 and said its new electric Range Rover had generated strong interest, as it pushes ahead with upgrades to its UK factories for electrical vehicle production. JLR made a profit before tax and exceptional items of ¬£627m in its third quarter, the three months to 31 December, up from ¬£235m a year earlier. Sales rose to ¬£7.4bn from ¬£6bn, as wholesale revenues of its Range Rover ‚Äì vehicles sold through dealerships ‚Äì hit a quarterly record. JLR sold 109,140 cars directly to customers. JLR said more than 16,000 people had signed up to the waiting list for pre-orders of the Range Rover Electric in the first six weeks, its new flagship vehicle that will be launched within the next 12 months. It is seen as a key step towards the company‚Äôs electric future as it tries to catch up with rivals. Mardell said: ‚ÄúThese are additional customers, not substitution customers. A couple of weeks ago, the wait list was about 10,000. So it‚Äôs grown a lot in January, which signals to me it‚Äôs going to increase at a steady pace over the next few months.‚Äù In December, JLR began road-testing prototypes of the vehicle, its first foray into building electric cars in the UK. Electric medium-sized sports utility vehicle prototypes and new all-electric Jaguar prototypes are also being built in the Midlands. JLR said it was installing a ¬£60m battery electric vehicle underbody line at Solihull, near Birmingham, a new body shop in Halewood, Merseyside, for electric models near completion, and production lines to manufacture electric drive units at Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. The carmaker has been relatively cautious about embracing electric vehicles, but last April announced a ¬£15bn investment plan to upgrade its factories and launch electric versions of its models, starting with the Range Rover. It is being manufactured at JLR‚Äôs factory in Solihull using many of the same tools as the existing Range Rovers, which are hybrids that combine smaller electric batteries with a petrol engine. The firm has not announced prices yet. The diesel hybrid Range Rover is priced from ¬£103,720.  Tata plans to invest ¬£4bn in opening an electric car battery gigafactory in Britain, creating 4,000 jobs. The facility in Somerset is due to begin production in 2026. Construction on the site has just started. At its Castle Bromwich site, JLR will expand stamping facilities that prepare pressed body metalwork to play a key role in the production of the next-generation electric vehicles. "

        "content": "The co-founder and boss of Superdry is hoping to buy back the struggling fashion brand as it considers store closures after a slump in sales. Julian Dunkerton, who owns a 20% stake, is in talks with potential partners to fund a cash offer for the company, which is valued at about ¬£40m on the stock market. Rumours of a possible offer for Superdry increased this week after it emerged that the Norwegian hedge fund First Seagull had bought a 5.3% stake in the hope of a buyout. Shares in the retailer jumped about 80% on Friday. Companies such as the Ted Baker owner Authentic Brands, and Next, which owns Joules, FatFace and Reiss, are possible backers for Dunkerton. The private-equity firm Sycamore Partners, which considered buying Ted Baker and previously owned Kurt Geiger, is another potential contender. Dunkerton has, meanwhile, held talks with the investment firm Rcapital and the restructuring specialist Gordon Brothers, the owner of Laura Ashley, according to Sky News. Dunkerton‚Äôs attempt to take Superdry private comes after the value of the company slumped more than 60% in the past year, as wholesale sales dived after exiting the US and many of its department store partners have closed or scaled back their operations. A warm autumn and winter also left the group with piles of unsold coats. Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 as a market stall in Cheltenham, growing it into one of the most successful names on the UK high street, selling T-shirts, jeans and coats. However, the business, which floated on the stock market in 2010, lost its way after Dunkerton left in 2018 before forcing his way back in a 2019 boardroom coup. Superdry confirmed that it had agreed to allow Dunkerton to start discussions with possible backers about a deal after its share price more than doubled on Friday morning. He has until 1 March to make an offer or stand down under Takeover Panel rules. The retailer said: ‚ÄúThese discussions are at a preliminary stage and no decisions have been made.‚Äù Superdry, which has about 3,350 staff and more than 215 stores, said it was continuing to draw up plans with newly appointed advisers for cost-saving measures, including possible store closures and job cuts, which were announced on Monday. That came on top of ¬£40m of cost cuts announced last week when the company reported that sales had dropped by nearly a quarter in the six months to October. Superdry also parted ways with its fourth finance director in five years as losses widened. Shaun Wills, who has been in the role for three years, is leaving the business and being replaced next week by the interim finance boss, Giles David, who previously worked at the struggling businesses McColl‚Äôs and the Casual Dining Group, both of which fell into administration."

        "content": "ExxonMobil has quashed an attempt by a group of climate activists to seek a vote on the US oil company‚Äôs climate strategy at its annual shareholder meeting later this year. A Dutch green activist investor group, Follow This, has dropped its petition for Exxon shareholders to vote on whether the company should set emissions reduction targets after Exxon took legal action against the plans. In a surprise move, the company filed a complaint at a US district court in Texas last month, which sought to prevent the activists from putting new climate targets to a vote at the company‚Äôs shareholder meeting in May.   Related: Shell to raise dividends again despite 30% fall in annual profits   It was the first time Exxon had sought a legal route to block shareholder activists, and the move was understood to have been closely watched by US corporations and shareholders. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: ‚ÄúGiven Exxon‚Äôs preference to fight a battle in court rather than allow shareholders the freedom of a vote at its annual meeting, we decided to withdraw the climate proposal. Now that we have withdrawn, the company has no reason to continue the lawsuit.‚Äù  Exxon argued that the Follow This proposal, which it put forward alongside Arjuna Capital, violated the SEC‚Äôs investor petition rules, which are designed to prevent shareholders being able to ‚Äúmicromanage‚Äù businesses‚Äô decisions through proposals. The company said that Follow This and Arjuna were ‚Äúdriven by an extreme agenda‚Äù and that their proposals were ‚Äúcalculated to diminish the company‚Äôs existing business‚Äù. Exxon reported one of its largest annual profits of the last decade of $36bn (about ¬£28.4bn) for 2023, which was the second-highest profit only to its $55.7bn profit for the year before. The 35% slump in profit was due to falling oil and gas market prices which peaked in 2022 following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. The global oil price averaged about $81 a barrel last year compared with $100 a barrel the year before.  Exxon has come under fire for producing more oil and gas despite warnings from experts around the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis. It has set a goal to reduce emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2050. But unlike other western oil companies, it has stopped short of setting reduction targets for the emissions created by burning its oil and gas, known as scope 3 emissions. The company said: ‚ÄúWe are simply asking the court to apply the SEC‚Äôs proxy rules as written to stop this abuse and eliminate the significant resources required to address them.‚Äù The SEC has come under pressure from some companies for allowing environmental groups to register what they believe to be too many motions at annual shareholder meetings, after it revoked policies adopted by the Trump administration."

        "content": "More than 130 years after it opened, the London flagship Fenwick department store will close its doors for the last time on Saturday. The four-storey shop in New Bond Street, Mayfair, is shutting after the retailer ‚Äì which is owned by more than 40 descendants of John James Fenwick, who founded the company with a single store in Newcastle in 1882 ‚Äì sold the property to developers for ¬£430m. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually devastated that it‚Äôs closing,‚Äù said Rosie Grant, 62, a costume designer, as she visited the store this week to give it ‚Äúone final, sad, farewell‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt just has an elegance to it that you don‚Äôt get in other shops. It‚Äôs more understated, it‚Äôs classic; it has things you actually need. You feel more at home than you do in a behemoth like Selfridges.‚Äù She has been coming to Fenwick at least twice a month, sometimes three times, for as long as she can remember. ‚ÄúIt always had a little something ‚Äì a hat, a ribbon, a bow ‚Äì that I could add to a costume to make it that little bit better,‚Äù Grant said. Grant would even take the people she was designing for into the store to try on designs. ‚ÄúThey had a nice discreet fitting room where we could try things,‚Äù she said. Those she has taken into that fitting room over the years include the Olivier award-winning actor and Sherlock star Lindsay Duncan, and Dame Judi Dench. This trip, however, Grant left Fenwick empty-handed. ‚ÄúThere was nothing I actually wanted,‚Äù she said of the store‚Äôs ‚Äúarchive sale‚Äù that promised up to 70% off. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much in there, most of the floors have been cleared out already, it‚Äôs a bit eerie.‚Äù Sali, also 62, had a much more successful shopping trip. ‚ÄúI got so many bargains,‚Äù she said, opening two large dark-green Fenwick paper shopping bags (the bags are listed on eBay for ¬£8 each). ‚ÄúI got a very cute little straw-coloured cap that was reduced from ¬£210 to ¬£100, and this [a jewelled headband] for ¬£50 ‚Äì it was ¬£195. ‚ÄúI am so sad that it‚Äôs closing. I have been coming twice a year for 35 years. It‚Äôs an institution. But money runs this place, and I guess money talks.‚Äù Fenwick‚Äôs official flagship store remains open on Northumberland Street, Newcastle, where it has been since 1884. The Fenwick family put the New Bond Street store, which opened in 1891, up for sale in late 2022, hoping it would fetch up to ¬£500m. It was sold for ¬£430m to Lazari Investments, a property development firm founded by the late Cyprus-born British billionaire Chris Lazari. Leonidas Lazari, one of his children, said previously: ‚ÄúOur group acquired the famous Fenwick department store that has been operating for 134 years, as well as the Dolce & Gabbana store on Bond Street in London. The corner site consists of six buildings and is considered one of the most attractive sites in Europe. The site includes 80 metres of exceptional frontage on Bond Street and Brook Street, with five upper levels.‚Äù The Lazaris have hired Norman Foster‚Äôs Foster + Partners architecture practice to ‚Äúrejuvenate‚Äù the site and create an almost 40%-larger building with a ‚Äúworld-class retail accommodation that is future-proof‚Äù on the ground and first floors with ‚Äúbest in class‚Äù offices above. Foster + Partners describe the plan as a ‚Äúdeep retrofit‚Äù that will include the demolition of parts of the buildings ‚Äì and while the facades will be kept, they will be raised significantly. Floorspace will increase by 38%. The building is not listed but is within the Mayfair conservation area. Part of the store will be taken over temporarily by a charity pop-ups. From 9 February, the Charity Super.Mkt group, which comprises five charities including Shelter, Traid, Shaw Trust and Havens Hospices, will inhabit the former handbag and accessories section. Described as the pre-loved department store, the multi-charity shop will open for a fortnight. It will also host events with DJs at weekends as it trades alongside luxury outlets including Dior, Herm√®s and Emporio Armani."

        "content": "An oil and gas company owned by a major Tory donor, which has been fined for illegal flaring, has been awarded a licence to drill for fossil fuels by the government. This week, the government granted the right to drill for fossil fuels in 24 new licence areas across the North Sea. One of the licences was given to EnQuest Heather, a subsidiary of EnQuest. Campaigners have criticised ministers for rewarding ‚Äúreckless and polluting behaviour‚Äù, pointing out that EnQuest was fined ¬£150,000 in 2022 by the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) for flaring an excess 262 tonnes of gas on the Magnus field between 30 November and 1 December 2021, despite knowing that it did not have the necessary consent in place. The campaigners also point out that since 2013, the EnQuest chief executive, Amjad Bseisu, has donated ¬£480,721.40 to the Conservative party in cash and in kind. The recent round of North Sea licences has been controversial. The government argues that producing more oil there will ‚Äúbolster energy security, reducing the UK‚Äôs reliance on imports from hostile foreign regimes such as Russia‚Äù, and that it is part of a ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù approach to the transition to net zero. The North Sea Transition Authority argues that the licenses ‚Äúwill help to ensure job security and provide benefits to the local and wider economy‚Äù. It said: ‚ÄúThe round is a key part of the North Sea Transition Authority‚Äôs (NSTA) drive to support the oil and gas industry, which currently contributes around three-quarters of domestic energy needs and, according to official forecasts, will continue to do so even as demand is reduced.‚Äù But the Climate Change Committee and other energy experts have warned that no new oil and gas licences should be given if climate catastrophe is to be averted. The Labour party has pledged that it would not grant any new oil and gas licences if in power. Flaring is a controversial process as it burns excess fossil fuels, so is unnecessarily polluting. It is a cheap method of disposing of the associated gas that comes from oil production, and is banned by countries including Norway but allowed in certain circumstances by the UK. The Good Law Project‚Äôs legal director, Emma Dearnaley, said: ‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs backing of a North Sea oil and gas extravaganza to help corporations and a wealthy few make huge profits instead of investing in cheaper and greener energy sources will come at huge cost to our environment and our economy. Do ministers think this a price worth paying just to keep their party donors happy?‚Äù Greenpeace UK‚Äôs senior climate campaigner, Philip Evans, said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that the Tory party might have an agenda when dishing out these new oil and gas licences. And since more oil and gas will only intensify the climate crisis, destroy lives and livelihoods around the world, and won‚Äôt even lower bills or make the UK more energy secure, you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that the government maybe doesn‚Äôt have our best interests at heart. But when those who are awarded the licences have a track record of reckless and polluting behaviour like breaching flaring rules all while bankrolling the Conservative government, of course eyebrows are going to be raised.‚Äù There are other methods to deal with excess natural gas, for example by capturing it so it is not wastefully burned, polluting the atmosphere for no reason. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: ‚ÄúEnQuest and the other companies that have been granted new exploration licences are betting that the world will fail to tackle climate change and that the demand for fossil fuels will stay high. ‚ÄúSuccessful global climate policy would mean demand will fall and the international market prices for oil and gas will drop. The relatively high operating costs in the North Sea mean that oil and gas production is unprofitable when market prices are low. ‚ÄúThat is why these operators need British consumers to continue to pay high prices for oil and gas, and why they prefer to vent and flare natural gas rather than make additional investments in the infrastructure to capture it instead. It is the economics of an industry that is awash with customers‚Äô money and finds it difficult to abandon inefficient, wasteful and polluting practices.‚Äù EnQuest and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero have been contacted for comment."

        "content": "Water companies have been urged to invest their profits in cutting bills to ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù trust in the tarnished industry, as suppliers in England and Wales announced costs would jump from April. Water UK, the industry trade body, said bills would increase by 6% or ¬£2 a month on average next financial year ‚Äì far more than the current 4% inflation rate. But the industry said bills would have been ¬£60 higher if they had kept pace with inflation over the past decade. However, the group‚Äôs argument will do little to reduce public outrage during a cost of living crisis for an industry that has been condemned for sewage dumping, years of underinvestment in infrastructure, large dividends, big bonuses and high debt levels. Water UK said the average combined bill for water and sewage services would be ¬£473 ‚Äì or ¬£1.29 a day ‚Äì from April. However, each supplier has set its own rates, based on factors including allowances and restrictions by the regulator Ofwat, bill increases in previous years and inflation. Wessex Water customers face the most expensive bills, with their annual cost rising to ¬£548 next financial year, from ¬£489. Anglian customers will pay ¬£529, up from ¬£489.  Interactive  The Observer revealed last month that the north Wales water company Hafren Dyfrdwy was expected to make the biggest increase, while Welsh Water was likely to reduce bills as a result of penalties for supply interruptions and leakage during the last financial year. Annual bills for Hafren Dyfrdwy customers will jump nearly 20% to ¬£433. Welsh Water will cut bills by ¬£20 to ¬£492 and South West Water will shave ¬£2 off annual bills by next year. In September, Ofwat ordered 12 underperforming companies to take ¬£114m off bills from April, including ¬£101m from debt-laden Thames Water. Severn Trent was allowed to add ¬£88m. Last year the industry vowed to invest ¬£10bn to tackle sewage pollution, but ‚Äúurgent‚Äù plans to detail the investments for MPs have been delayed. On Friday, Water UK said companies would invest ¬£14.4bn ‚Äì the highest amount in a single year ‚Äì to help ‚Äúensure the security of our water supply in the future and significantly reduce the amount of sewage in rivers and seas‚Äù. The Water UK chief executive, David Henderson, said: ‚ÄúNext year will see record levels of investment from water companies to secure the security of our water supply in the future and significantly reduce the amount of sewage in rivers and seas.‚Äù These investments include the completion of the Thames ‚Äúsuper sewer‚Äù; work on the Havant Thicket reservoir project in Hampshire; and a ¬£39m water treatment works to be built by South East Water in Kent, where residents have endured supply interruptions and water shortages. Henderson said support for customer bills was doubling, with more than 2 million families to be helped. But the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) repeated calls for the remaining water suppliers to join Welsh Water, Severn Trent, Yorkshire Water, SES Water and United Utilities in using their profits to help fund social tariffs, rather than part-funding this through charges on other customers. Mike Keil, the chief executive of the CCW, said: ‚ÄúAlmost a fifth of households say they struggle to pay their water bill, and these rises will heap even greater pressure on low-income customers. If water companies are serious about rebuilding trust in the sector, they should use some of their profits to help people who cannot afford another bill rise.‚Äù The Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, Tim Farron MP, said: ‚ÄúThis is a kick in the teeth from the same dodgy water firms who pollute rivers with sewage while pocketing millions in bonuses. They have no shame. This price hike is a disgrace and should be scrapped immediately.‚Äù"

        "content": "Labour will not raise corporation tax above its current rate of 25% during the next parliament, the party has pledged, in an attempt to offer businesses greater certainty ‚Äì but the promise has prompted warnings about a lack of fiscal flexibility.\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the tax pledge included maintaining full expensing, which allows businesses that invest in IT equipment and machinery to claim back up to 100% of the cost of the investment by writing it off against tax on their profits. \nShe said Labour would also maintain the annual investment allowance introduced by Jeremy Hunt.\nSpeaking at a conference in London attended by 400 executives, Reeves said business and government must work together ‚Äúlike never before‚Äù.\nShe said: ‚ÄúWe reject the calls from those on the right wing of the Conservative party to cut corporation tax. Our current rate is the lowest in the G7. \n‚ÄúWe believe that a 25% rate strikes the correct balance between the needs of our public finances and the demands of a competitive global economy.\n‚ÄúThe next Labour government will make the pro-business choice and the pro-growth choice. We will cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of 25% for the next parliament. And should our competitiveness come under threat, if necessary, we will act.‚Äù\n \n\n\n\n\n\nShe accused the government of pushing through Brexit without a plan and of bringing instability and uncertainty by churning through a succession of ministers. \nReeves has sought to woo the business community over several years as part of a strategy to improve the party‚Äôs reputation for managing the economy. ‚ÄúThis Labour party sees profit as not something to be disdained but of business succeeding,‚Äù she said.\nThe conference, for which tickets sold out within hours, heard that Labour would listen to the concerns of UK firms, overhauling the planning system and investing in green infrastructure.\nThe corporation tax pledge comes just a day after Reeves surprised some in the party by saying Labour would not reinstate a cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses if it wins power.\nCompass, the Labour-aligned thinktank, said the decision on corporation tax ‚Äúonly serves to underline how difficult it is to change things under our political system‚Äù.\nNeal Lawson, its director, said: ‚ÄúMore and more people and organisations want a society that is fairer and more equal, and better investment in our crumbling public services. \n‚ÄúBut to win under FPTP [first past the post] means promising to the corporate lobby that nothing much will change, and so dissatisfaction with politics grows.‚Äù\nEd Balls, the former shadow chancellor, said there was a risk that Reeves would ‚Äúbox herself in quite a lot‚Äù on tax before the election. \nHe told the Political Currency podcast: ‚ÄúThe more commitments you make on tax in opposition, the harder it is to govern when you‚Äôre there. And she‚Äôs definitely making her task more difficult.‚Äù\nWhile the conference was aimed at further boosting Labour‚Äôs ties with business, a key section of Keir Starmer‚Äôs speech to the event was to set out the party‚Äôs plan for better workers‚Äô rights, saying he wanted to ‚Äúlevel up workers‚Äô rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades‚Äù.\nHe said: ‚ÄúThat might not please everyone in the room or the wider business community. But nobody can doubt that our labour market is at the heart of our challenges on productivity, a clear reason why the wealth we create fails to generate economic security. That‚Äôs not just an argument about social justice, it‚Äôs also about growth.‚Äù \nShevaun Haviland, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses were having a tough time and ‚Äúurgently need stability and long-term certainty‚Äù.\nShe said: ‚ÄúThe [cap] will give both UK firms and global companies looking to invest here the confidence to help the economy get back to sustainable growth.‚Äù\nNigel Higgins, the chair of Barclays, who was on a breakfast panel with the Abrdn chair, Douglas Flint, and the chair of Legal & General, Sir John Kingman, said Labour‚Äôs report on the finance industry ‚Äì published at the conference ‚Äì showed how banks and insurance companies could support the wider economy.\n‚ÄúA vibrant and dynamic financial services sector is crucial for long-term economic growth. This report recognises this fact and helps to join up some of the interconnected issues, challenges and opportunities within the sector, including recognising the importance of international competitiveness,‚Äù he said.\nMiles Celic, the chief executive of TheCityUK, which represents the financial services industry, said the plan showed ‚Äúa clear focus on innovation, modernising the regulatory landscape, driving more investment, and unlocking growth in the wider economy‚Äù."

        "content": "Britain‚Äôs factories have been hit by disruption caused by Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea that led to shipping delays and contributed to rising costs, as the boss of Adidas warned about ‚Äúexploding‚Äù global freight rates. UK manufacturers have experienced growing supply chain difficulties, as the Red Sea crisis led to the rerouting of deliveries of raw materials, components and other goods away from the Suez Canal, a survey has shown. The UK manufacturing sector remained in decline at the start of 2024, when output and new orders fell further, leading to more job losses and cuts in purchasing and stocks, according to the monthly survey from S&P Global. Its purchasing managers‚Äô index was at 47.0 in January, up from 46.2 in December but below an earlier flash estimate of 47.3. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction; any reading above points to expansion. The Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran, have said they attacked ships in response to Israel‚Äôs bombardment of Gaza. Israel is retaliating against an attack on 7 October by Hamas, which controls Gaza. The US and UK governments have launched airstrikes against the Houthi rebels. Some manufacturers in the survey said 12 to 18 days could be added to some expected deliveries, disrupting their production schedules and raising inflationary pressures at a time when companies were struggling with weak demand at home and overseas. Bj√∏rn Gulden, the chief executive of Adidas, Europe‚Äôs largest sportswear manufacturer Adidas, said shipping disruptions would affect profit margins. He said ‚Äúexploding‚Äù freight rates were driving up costs and shipping delays were causing some delivery problems. Gulden said: ‚ÄúThe spot rates are exploding again, so if you don‚Äôt have a long-term contract or you ship more than your contract there is an increased cost because of that. ‚ÄúThere is a delay currently of about three weeks which of course causes some delivery issues, especially to the European market.‚Äù The world‚Äôs top shipping companies, including Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, have diverted ships from the Suez Canal and rerouted them around the southern tip of Africa, adding thousands of miles to journeys and delaying the arrival in Europe of manufacturing components and goods such as clothes and shoes made in Asia. Rob Dobson, the director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ‚ÄúCost and stock management initiatives are being complicated by the Red Sea crisis. Diverting purchased inputs, especially those sourced from the Asia-Pacific region, around the Cape of Good Hope is raising prices and extending supplier lead times.‚Äù The Suez canal normally handles about 12% of global trade, and about half of freight shipped through the canal is made up of containerised goods. Oil shipments also travel through this route, from the Persian Gulf to Europe and North America, and the continued Houthi rebel attacks on container ships have driven crude oil prices higher. In the US, the Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs latest manufacturing survey, also released on Thursday, showed supplier delivery times rebounded to their highest level in more than a year, while the prices paid index hit a nine-month high. However, the overall manufacturing index bounced back to 49.1 in January from 47.1 in December, suggesting the downturn in the sector wasreceding."

        "content": "Shell‚Äôs investors can expect another year of growing payouts after the oil company reported better than expected profits of more than $28bn (¬£22bn) for 2023 in one of its most profitable years on record. Shell‚Äôs profits tumbled by almost a third to $28.3bn last year, from record high profits of $40bn at the peak of the global energy crisis in 2022, after a cooling of oil and gas markets. But the company‚Äôs earnings were still the second highest it has reported since 2011 after a better than expected final quarter in which Shell reported adjusted earnings of $7.3bn compared with forecasts of just over $6bn. The oil company, which handed its shareholders $23bn in payouts last year, plans to raise its dividend by 4% and return $3.5bn to investors in share buy-backs over the first quarter of 2024. Shell‚Äôs chief executive, Wael Sawan, revealed the expectation-beating results as green activists staged a protest outside the company‚Äôs London headquarters. Greenpeace campaigners held a mock party dressed as Shell board members while holding a burning sign reading ‚ÄúYour Future‚Äù.  Sawan told investors that the company was on track to cut billions in costs while raising dividends and increasing its oil and gas production. The plans have angered green campaigners, who have called for the company to reduce its fossil fuel production and invest more of its profits in green energy alternatives. Shell invested $2.7bn in its low-carbon business last year, or just over 10% of its total investments, down from 14% of its total spending in 2022. Mark van Baal, the founder of green shareholder group Follow This, said: ‚ÄúThe decreased investments in its clean energy division show that Shell is not serious about the energy transition. As long as investments in fossil fuels dwarf investments in renewables, Shell cannot claim to be in transition.‚Äù  Sawan, who became chief executive early last year, has also reversed a plan to reduce Shell‚Äôs oil and gas production by 1-2% a year in pursuit of higher profits. He said the company added 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day to its production last year and by 2025 would start enough new fossil fuel projects to add half a million barrels a day. The new oil and gas projects would enable Shell to ‚Äúcontinue providing the energy security that the world needs, while delivering cashflow longevity into the future‚Äù, he said. The decision to continue investing in fossil fuels goes against advice from climate experts who have said there can be no new fossil fuel development if the world hopes to avoid a climate crisis. Shell said last year that it plans to cut hundreds of jobs from its low carbon division as part of a plan to cut its costs by between $2bn and $3bn by the end of 2025. Sawan said the company had already cuts its structural costs by $1bn. Sinead Gorman, Shell‚Äôs chief financial officer, said the company would remain ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù in its low-carbon spending and would ‚Äúwalk away‚Äù from opportunities where the returns are lower than their shareholders would expect. The company is expected to set out its priorities for low-carbon spending in March, but is not expected to set new green targets.  Sjoukje van Oosterhout, a researcher at Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands, accused Shell of choosing ‚Äúshareholders over the climate, once again‚Äù. ‚ÄúWael Sawan [CEO of Shell] is still pressing on the brakes when it comes to sustainable investments and in the meantime is still launching major new fossil projects, for example in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. Time is running out, but Shell refuses to change course and is racing full speed towards the destruction of the earth,‚Äù Van Oosterhout said."

        "content": "  3.55pm GMT  Closing post  Time for a recap. The Bank of England has dropped the broadest possible hint that the next move in interest rates will be downwards after forecasting inflation will fall below 2% within months, despite keeping borrowing costs unchanged for a fourth consecutive time. Threadneedle Street stressed that more evidence was required that inflation would stick at the target set by the government before the Bank could deliver a first cut to borrowing costs since the start of the pandemic. It warned that risks from fast-rising prices remained amid the cost of living crisis. In a widely expected decision, the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority to keep interest rates at the current level of 5.25%, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.  Interactive  However, one member of the panel ‚Äì the independent economist Swati Dhingra ‚Äì pushed for an immediate reduction in borrowing costs, in a powerful signal to financial markets that the central bank was edging closer to taking action. Two more policymakers, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann ‚Äì pushed for a further quarter-point increase in the Bank rate.   Related: Bank of England sticks with 5.25% interest rate but hints at coming cut   BoE governor Andrew Bailey said the recent falls in UK inflation were good news, but cautioned that the Bank needed to have more confidence that price rises would keep slowing, and stay low.  Governor Andrew Bailey explains today‚Äôs decision to hold interest rates at 5.25%. pic.twitter.com/7DUyd2BumC‚Äî Bank of England (@bankofengland) February 1, 2024  Bailey told reporters in London that inflation may rise a little in January, but is expected to then drop to the 2% target this spring, before rising again. He said:  ‚ÄúWe have had good news on inflation over the past few months. It has fallen a long way, from 10% a year ago to 4%. But we need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.‚Äù  Bailey also warned that the Bank couldn‚Äôt simply cut rates once inflation hits 2%, but explained that the bank has dropped its previous guidance that the next move in rates was more likely to be higher than lower. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt banged this message home too, saying it was good news that interest rates have peaked.

But, it suggests there is a 10%-ish chance of a cut ‚Äì even though two policymakers vote for a rise at this week‚Äôs meeting, and only one for a cut. Orla Garvey, Senior Fixed Income Portfolio Manager at Federated Hermes Limited, says Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann‚Äôs votes for higher interest rates seem ‚Äòrather incongrous‚Äô:  ‚ÄúAs expected, there was no change in UK monetary policy at this meeting of the Bank of England. Given that the voting split and the tone of the minutes were slightly dovish, the two votes for a hike seemed rather incongruous. We were focused on changes in forecasts, specifically to wages and CPI, both of which have come lower. The press conference had a relatively balanced tone, nevertheless, we noted Governor Bailey‚Äôs comments around keeping the March meeting live. Currently, a rate cut in March is priced at 12%.‚Äù      3.03pm GMT  Hunt: Positive news that rates seem to have peaked  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said it is ‚Äúpositive news‚Äù that interest rates appeared to have peaked. Speaking to reporters after the Bank of England held base rate at 5.25% today, Hunt said:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously very positive news for families with mortgages that interest rates appear to have peaked, but we should remember that inflation never falls in a straight line.‚Äù   The MPC maintained Bank Rate at 5.25% this lunchtime, while making something of a dovish pivot, in noting that the next move will be a cut, with focus now shifting to the duration for which rates will remain at their present levelRead the full article: https://t.co/G4mbzi7HjO pic.twitter.com/I5whoqykni‚Äî Pepperstone (@PepperstoneFX) February 1, 2024   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    2.52pm GMT  Bank of England interest rate decision: What the experts say  The Bank of England has sent three clear signals to markets that policymakers are shifting from a hawkish stance to a neutral one, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg. Those signals are the shifting balance of votes (one policymaker wanting a cut, while the number of votes for a rise fell from three to two); the removal of the guidance that the next move would probably be higher, and new forecasts showing inflation hitting 2% this spring. Pickering adds:  This opens the door for rate cuts soon as long as inflation heads lower at a pace roughly in line with the BoE‚Äôs updated forecast. On the news, money markets continued to expect five 25bp cuts in 2024 with a first cut in Q2 ‚Äì market participants are split on whether the first cut will come in May or June.  Gurpreet Gill, macro strategist at global fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says the Bank remains cautious:  ‚ÄúThe Bank of England removed its hiking bias but remains cautious on pivoting towards rate cuts. We continue to think the downtrend in inflation and subdued activity will see the Bank descend from its ‚Äútable mountain‚Äù posture this spring, with rate cuts at subsequent meetings throughout the year.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith market pricing for UK monetary easing now converging to our outlook and the potential for looser fiscal policy presenting upside risks to bond yields, we are cautious on UK gilts.‚Äù  Paul Dales of Capital Economics predicts that rate cuts could come sooner than the BoE implies, saying:  While leaving interest rates at 5.25% for the fourth meeting in a row today, the Bank of England sent a signal that the next move will be a cut, but it pushed back strongly against the idea that rates will be cut soon or far. Our forecast that inflation will fall further and faster than the Bank expects suggests it will change its tune in the coming months. A rate cut in June is still possible and we think rates will end 2025 at 3.00%. That‚Äôs lower than current market pricing of 3.25-3.50%.  Carsten Jung, senior economist at IPPR, warns that the Bank may act too slowly:  The fight against inflation is not yet over, but the end is in sight. This is largely due to global supply chains recovering and energy costs falling and not due to rising unemployment, as the Bank and most economists initially expected. ‚ÄúErrors were made, regarding how we‚Äôve been tackling inflation. There was too little focus on - and understanding of - the ripple effects of global shocks and too much attention on people asking for a pay rise. This matters because, as a result, the BoE tightened the screws too much. This will hurt the recovery. Similar to the US central bank, the Bank should reverse course and cut rates sooner this year. ‚ÄúBut even though inflation is coming down people‚Äôs incomes have still not caught up with the increased prices of the last years, with hundreds of thousands having newly fallen into destitution. More support is needed to support them. And we need more creative policy action to bring prices down, including on food and energy.‚Äù       2.24pm GMT  Analysis: UK interest rates have peaked, the next move is down ‚Ä¶ but not yet  Interest rates have peaked. The next move in borrowing costs will be down. But not yet. Those were the three key messages from the Bank of England in its latest assessment of the state of the economy, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes.  Those conclusions may not be immediately apparent from the minutes of the latest meeting on Threadneedle Street of the monetary policy committee (MPC) ‚Äì the body tasked with setting interest rates to hit the government‚Äôs 2% inflation target ‚Äì because the MPC had a three-way split. Six members voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25%, two voted for them to rise to 5.5% while one voted for a reduction to 5%.  Here‚Äôs Larry‚Äôs full analysis:   Related: UK interest rates have peaked, the next move is down ‚Ä¶ but not yet       2.21pm GMT  Video: Bank says 'we're heading in the right direction' in battle against inflation  The Bank of England have released a video of governor Andrew Bailey explaining today‚Äôs decision to leave rates on hold. In it, he makes some points we‚Äôve already heard in today‚Äôs press conference:  We‚Äôve held rates because, even though there has been good news on inflation, we need to be sure that it falls back to our 2% target and stays there sustainably. That means we need to see more evidence that inflation will fall further, and stay low, before we are able to lower interest rates.  Bailey adds that we can‚Äôt yet declare victory in the battle against inflation, but insists ‚Äúwe‚Äôre heading in the right direction‚Äù.  Governor Andrew Bailey explains today‚Äôs decision to hold interest rates at 5.25%. pic.twitter.com/7DUyd2BumC‚Äî Bank of England (@bankofengland) February 1, 2024      2.06pm GMT   Q: Is there a greater risk to waiting too long to cut rates, or from cutting too early? That‚Äôs a judgement we look at each meeting, Andrew Bailey says, a little cagely. But there is an important point ‚Äì policy could still be restrictive even if rates were cut.     2.05pm GMT   Q: How much of the previous tightening from the Bank of England is still to come through to the real economy? About 30%, Andrew Bailey estimates. That‚Äôs down from around 50% estimated in November ‚Äì partly because market interest rates have dropped, and partly because more time has elapsed.     1.51pm GMT   Andrew Bailey is then bowled a tricky delivery about crypto ‚Äì an area he‚Äôs been critical of in the past. Q: How do you feel when you see two former chancellor of the exchequer being paid by the crypto industry? Are you concerned there is a ‚Äúbackdoor channel‚Äù of influence into UK policymaking? [Reminder: yesterday we learned that George Osborne has been hired by the American cryptocurrency exchange operator Coinbase, following Philip Hammond who already chairs crypto firm Copper].   Related: George Osborne joins Coinbase as crypto firm faces US court fight   Bailey doesn‚Äôt directly address these moves by ex-chancellors. But he says there‚Äôs a difference between unbacked crypto, such as bitcoin, and stable coins. He still believes unbacked crypto has no intrinsic value, and is not money in any sense. Stablecoins, though, purport to be money, so should be held to a higher standard, Bailey says.   Related: Russian banker who is under sanctions sold ¬£15m of shares in Philip Hammond crypto firm Copper       1.43pm GMT   Q: Would the Bank of England feel comfortable holding interest rates on hold for longer, even if the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both cut rates earlier? Andrew Bailey smilingly replies that all central banks take decisions based on their domestic situation; that‚Äôs how they‚Äôll justify whatever decisions they take. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in too, pointing out that services inflation is lower in the US and eurozone.     1.39pm GMT   Q: When inflation falls to 2% in the spring, as you expect, many people will declare victory in the battle against inflation. Would they be wrong? Andrew Bailey says the Bank‚Äôs mandate is price stability ‚Äì defined at 2% on a sustained basis. So the Bank‚Äôs forecast that inflation falls to 2% in April-June, before bouncing up again, does not show sustained price stability. But, it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood news‚Äù that inflation is coming down, he insists. And he refuses to give any steer about what the Bank might do at its next meeting in seven week‚Äôs time; that meeting is ‚Äòlive‚Äô, and policymakers will look at all the data.     1.30pm GMT  Bailey: Don't need inflation back at 2% to cut rates  We don‚Äôt need to say inflation back at the 2% target before cutting interest rates, governor Andrew Bailey insists ‚Äì just more confidence that it is heading there sustainably.     1.30pm GMT   Q: What would it take for the Bank of England to cut rates? Lowest service sector inflation, more slack in the labour market, or a further fall in pay settlements? These are exactly the indicators that have guided us over the last year, says deputy governor Ben Broadbent. They‚Äôll remain just as important. He adds that the Bank needs to have more confidence that inflation will fall and stay low, rather than better-than-expected ‚Äúdownside surprises‚Äù in the data.     1.26pm GMT   Q: Are you worried that the government will ‚Äòthrow the kitchen sink‚Äô in March‚Äôs budget, and create more problems for the Bank of England? Andrew Bailey swerves any temptation to comment on tax and spending decisions, saying the Bank simply takes the government‚Äôs fiscal policy into account when it sets monetary policy.     1.24pm GMT   Q: History suggests that most pay deals are done by April‚Ä¶. do you want to see how this year‚Äôs negotiations play out before deciding whether to cut rates? Governor Bailey says the average weekly earnings index has fallen recently. He points out that wages are set in markets, but indicates that the fall in inflation could ease the pressure to raise wages. Bailey says inflation has been falling rapidly, that should be passed through into inflation expectations, and those expectations are then reflected into labour costs and services inflation. Bailey insists he‚Äôs not making a ‚Äúpreaching point, at all‚Äù (having been criticised a couple of years ago for warning that pay rises could embed inflation). This is simply the mechanism you‚Äôd expect to happen.     1.20pm GMT   Q: Fed chair Jerome Powell said yesterday he didn‚Äôt believe that working from home doesn‚Äôt boost productivity ‚Äì do you agree? Andrew Bailey says he‚Äôs not qualified to answer this one, as someone who comes into the office every day.  Updated at 1.20pm GMT    1.16pm GMT   Q: The public want as clear guidance as possible about what is likely to happen next to interest rates. Is the Bank signalling that interest rates have probably peaked, and the next move is probably down? Andrew Bailey repeats his earlier comment about the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù that inflation has fallen to 4%, and that the Bank has removed its earlier guidance that the next move in interest rates would probably be up. The question has changed, the governor says, from how restrictive should the Bank be to how long it should maintain its restrictive stance. That is the core question in our framework now, he insists. Q: Can you bring inflation down to 2% sustainably without pushing up unemployment? Bailey says the Bank‚Äôs latest forecast for unemployment is lower than it was in November.     1.10pm GMT  Bailey: Won't leave rates unchanged for longer than we have to  Q: Cash-strapped homeowners and renters will want to know why you‚Äôre not acting now, and cutting interest rates. Are you saying that things will get worse later in the year? Andrew Bailey says he very much understands the situation faced by those people. And he says the Bank has two messages: 1) It needs to get inflation down to target, and keep it there on a sustained basis. Although inflation is seen rising somewhat later this year, it‚Äôs not heading back to 10% (the 40-year peak in 2022). 2) The question it faces now is how long to maintain the current stance. Bailey says:  We will not maintain it for any longer than we need to do to achieve the objective of inflation being at 2% at a sustained basis.  Keeping inflation at 2% is the best thing we can do for households, the governor adds.  Updated at 1.12pm GMT    1.04pm GMT   Q: Given the stickiness of services inflation, will the ‚Äòlast mile‚Äô of bringing inflation down be the hardest part of the battle? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent explains that this ‚Äòlast mile‚Äô of inflation is to do with tackling stickier domestic inflation, rather than the impact of imported energy prices.     1.03pm GMT   Q: Yesterday, America‚Äôs top central banker, Jay Powell, indicated that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be able to cut interest rates as soon as March ‚Äì could the Bank of England come to a similar conclusion? Andrew Bailey resists any temptation to copy the Fed, saying he will not speculate what the Bank might do at its next meeting. He points out that two sets of inflation and labour market statistics will be released before the Bank‚Äôs next meeting in mid-March. They will inform the MPC‚Äôs decision.     1.00pm GMT   Andrew Bailey says he will not speculate on how the Bank might change interest rates in the future. Evidence will be assessed ‚Äúexhaustively‚Äù at each BoE meeting, he adds.     12.59pm GMT   Q: Is the Bank‚Äôs next move more likely to be a cut, or a hike, or are you competely neutral on that? Andrew Bailey flashes a bit of ankle (figuratively speaking!), pointing out that the Bank has removed language that had an ‚Äòupside bias‚Äô on the interest rate outlook from its statement.  Updated at 12.59pm GMT    12.57pm GMT   Q: Your forecasts suggest keeping rates on hold risks turning sluggish growth into a recession ‚Äì how do you justify that? This is a reference to a section of the Bank‚Äôs economic forecasts that show how the economy would fare with no changes to borrowing costs. Andrew Bailey points out that the market had not expected a rate cut today, so the Bank‚Äôs decision is consistent with those expectations.     12.54pm GMT   Onto questions‚Ä¶ Q: Given inflation is falling faster than expected, you‚Äôve marginally increased the tightening in the economy by leaving rates on hold ‚Äì how can you justify that when growth is so weak? BoE governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank is looking at the level of ‚Äòpersistence‚Äô of inflation, and repeats that inflation is expected to rise later this year after dropping to its 2% target this spring. Bailey then bats the question to his deputy, Ben Broadbent‚Ä¶.  Bailey bringing Broadbent in on the first Q is not usually a reassuring sign...‚Äî Michael Brown (@MrMBrown) February 1, 2024  ‚Ä¶. who denies that the BoE has effectively lifted ‚Äòreal rates‚Äô by leaving Bank Rate on hold even though inflation has been dropping. Broadbent argues that inflation expectations are more important than headline CPI, and that two-year interest rates are more important to the economy than overnight rates. Those two-year rates have dropped sharply in recent months, helping pull down mortgage rates.  Updated at 1.04pm GMT    12.50pm GMT    Bailey - about 2/3 of impact of impact of prior hikes has now fed through to the economy‚Äî Michael Brown (@MrMBrown) February 1, 2024      12.48pm GMT   Touching on the 6-2-1 split at this week‚Äôs meeting, Andrew Bailey says the Bank of England will ‚Äúkeep under review‚Äù how long it should keep interest rates at their current level.     12.46pm GMT   The Bank believes that if it keeps interest rates at 5.25% for the next three years, it‚Äôs likely that inflation would fall significantly below the 2% target, Andrew Bailey says. However, if the Bank followed the market path for interest rates (showing four or five rate cuts this year), inflation would be above that target for most of the period, he says. So how long will a restrictive stance be needed? It all depends on the incoming data, Bailey explains, such as for wage growth and unemployment. And he warns that geopolitical tensions have intensified ‚Äì with shipping volumes down materially on Red Sea routes, and shipping costs up.

Price stability is the foundation of a healthy economy, and we must get inflation back to the 2% target sustainably, and we will do that.  The governor then outlines that inflation may tick up in January‚Äôs report, but by March inflation could have fallen to 3%, and then fall to around 2% in April, May and June. But (as flagged earlier), inflation is expected to rise by the end of this year, as the negative impact from lower energy prices fades. It‚Äôs not a simple as saying the job is done when inflation returns to target in the spring, Bailey insists.     12.34pm GMT  Bank of England governor: Things are moving in the right direction  Over at Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England is holding a press conference to explain today‚Äôs decision. Andrew Bailey, the Bank‚Äôs governor, starts by saying that we‚Äôve had good news.  Inflation has fallen a long way, Bailey says, from 10% a year ago to 4% in December.  Things are moving in the right direction.  But, Bailey says, the Bank has to be more confident that inflation will fall to its 2% target, and stay there,  We are not yet at a point where we can lower interest rates.  As such, the level of Bank Rate ‚Äúremains appropriate‚Äù at 5.25%, he insists  (although three of the MPC didn‚Äôt agree with him!)  The #MonetaryPolicyReport press conference is about to start.

The Bank says the MPC is prepared to adjust monetary policy to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably, and will keep ‚Äòunder review‚Äô how long to keep rates at 5.25%.  It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.   NEW- @BankofEngland votes to leave interest rates on hold at 5.25%- One MPC member (Swati Dhingra) voted to reduce borrowing costs to 5%.- First three-way split on whether to cut, hold or raise since 2008.‚Äî Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) February 1, 2024      12.18pm GMT  How the Bank was split over rate vote  The minutes of the Bank of England‚Äôs meeting show that the two hawks, MPC members Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann, pushed to raise interest rates to 5.5% to tackle the risks of ‚Äúmore deeply embedded inflation persistence‚Äù. Mann and Haskel told colleagues that this would help to return inflation to target sustainably in the medium term. But across the table, Swati Dhingra argued that the MPC should cut rates now ‚Äì pointing out that monetary policy operates with a lag (so much of the previous increases since December 2021 haven‚Äôt fully fed through to the economy). Waiting for lagging indicators of domestic relative price growth to fall sharply before reducing rates would come with a risk of overtightening, Dhingra pointed out ‚Äì and after all, UK inflation was already on a firm downward trajectory. The remaining six members were happy, though, to sit on their hands ‚Äì concluding that the risks to inflation were more balanced.  The minutes say:  Although services price inflation and wage growth had fallen by somewhat more than had been expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remained elevated. There were questions, on which further evidence would be required, about how entrenched this persistence would be, and therefore about how long the current level of Bank Rate would need to be maintained.      12.10pm GMT  Inflation to hit 2% target, but not for long....  The Bank of England says inflation will hit its target of 2% in the second quarter of this year ‚Äì down from 4% in December. However, it‚Äôs not celebrating ‚Äì as inflation is expected to increase again in the second half of this year. CPI inflation is expected to be around 2.75% at the end of 2024, based on market expectation for interest rates. The Bank blames ‚Äúthe persistence of domestic inflationary pressures‚Äù, adding:  CPI inflation is projected to be 2.3% in two years‚Äô time and 1.9% in three years.   Updated at 12.11pm GMT    12.07pm GMT   The Bank of England says that global GDP growth has remained subdued since its last meeting in December ‚Äì although activity in the US is stronger. Inflationary pressures are abating across the euro area and United States, the BoE says. But it also points to the risks of geopolitical tensions pushing up costs, saying:  Wholesale energy prices have fallen significantly. Material risks remain from developments in the Middle East and from disruption to shipping through the Red Sea. Following recent weakness, GDP growth is expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag on the rate of growth from past increases in Bank Rate. Business surveys are consistent with an improving outlook for activity in the near term.      12.05pm GMT   I think this is the first time that the Bank of England‚Äôs policymakers have been split between raising rates, leaving them on hold, and cutting them since the financial crisis in 2008.  ps. in April, July and August 2008, Tim Besley went for a 25bps hike and Danny Blanchflower for a 25bps cut, with the majority voting to keep rates on hold... pic.twitter.com/mxsp2ApTAD‚Äî Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) February 1, 2024      12.02pm GMT  BANK OF ENGLAND HOLDS RATES IN THREE-WAY SPLIT  Newsflash: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged, in a rare three-way split! Bank Rate will remain at 5.25%, a 16-year high. That will disappoint borrowers, such as mortgage holders, hoping to see a drop in borrowing costs today. But it‚Äôs bang in line with City forecasts. But, the decision is not unanimous ‚Ä¶ two members of the Bank‚Äôs Monetary Policy Committee preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. The Bank says:  Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members voted against the proposition. Two members (Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%.

Monks adds:  ‚ÄúThe Bank of England‚Äôs updated narrative is likely to be that clear progress is being made on inflation, but that it is too early to declare victory and therefore caution must be exercised when thinking about when and how quickly policy can be normalised.      11.00am GMT  Bank of England interest rate decision nears  Excitement is building in the City as the clock ticks towards noon, when the Bank of England will set UK interest rates. As flagged in the introduction, the Bank is expected to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 5.25% today, their highest level since 2008. But there‚Äôs a lot of interest in how soon the BoE will start cutting rates, given the falls in inflation in the last year and concerns that UK could drop into recession. Mike Riddell, Head of Macro Unconstrained at Allianz Global Investors, predicts that the Bank will start to cut interest rates by the summer. But, he warns, ‚Äúthe water is getting muddier‚Äù. Riddell says:  Only a month ago, markets were convinced that the Bank of England would begin a rate cutting cycle in March, as the UK economy had stagnated and inflation was rapidly dropping.   The next move in UK interest rates will almost certainly be down, but the timing has become more uncertain. The UK economy, and indeed much of the rest of Europe, has been showing some signs of life again. Businesses and consumers are saying they‚Äôre more confident about the outlook. The UK housing market is also picking up, perhaps buoyed by a fall in mortgage rates. It seems likely that the Bank of England will revise its growth forecast for this year higher as a result.  Inflation optimism has faded a little too. The BoE will be relieved to see that the UK labour market has cooled further, but the reality is that wage growth remains elevated and at a level that is inflationary. Inflation itself is still running way too hot, and on some measures, surprisingly ticked higher in January. The recent escalation in the Middle East puts further upside risk to inflation.      10.50am GMT   Price rises have helped communications group BT to grow its revenues and profits. BT has reported that revenues grew 3% in the last nine months, due to price increases and the rollout of faster, ‚Äúfibre to the premises‚Äù broadband.

In its annual results this morning, Euroclear says it made ‚Ç¨5.5bn of net interest earnings in 2023, of which ‚Ç¨4.4bn relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings will generate over ‚Ç¨1bn for the Belgian State in 2023. Western sanctions means Euroclear is unable to pass on coupon payments and redemptions to sanctioned entities, so cash is stacking up on its balance sheet ‚Äì which had swelled by ‚Ç¨38bn by the end of 2023 to ‚Ç¨162bn. Euroclear says it incurred ‚Ç¨62m of direct costs related to Russian assets, on top of ‚Ç¨24m of lost business from sanctioned clients. Across the world, there are over $300bn of frozen Russian assets. In December, the US proposed that working groups from the G7 explore ways to seize this money, and use it to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine.  UK foreign secretary David Cameroon ramped up the pressure at Davos last month, saying there was a ‚Äúmoral, political, legal, and economic case for using the money to repair Ukraine‚Äôs war damage.   Related: UK urges west to use frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine‚Äôs economy   Euroclear says it will retain profits on Russian assets until it is provided with further guidance on the distribution or management of such profits. It says:  2023 also saw various parties contest the consequences of the application of sanctions, with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing, almost exclusively in Russian courts. Claimants have initiated legal proceeding aiming mainly to access the assets blocked in Euroclear‚Äôs books. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims. In parallel, the Board notes that the European Commission is contemplating various options to use the profits generated by the reinvestment of sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions, including Euroclear, for the financing of Ukraine‚Äôs reconstruction.      10.15am GMT   Once-troubled lender TSB is proving to be a cash generator for its Spanish parent company, Sabadell.  The UK lender had at one point been put up for a potential sale after years of losses linked to a major IT meltdown in 2018, related to its separation from Lloyds Banking Group. But TSB said on Thursday would be handing over a ¬£120m dividend to Sabadell this spring, up from ¬£50m in 2022, marking its second straight payout to the Spanish lender.  The payout follows its second straight year of annual profit, with pre-tax earnings rising nearly 30% to ¬£237m.  However, the rise in profits was driven by high interest rates that allowed the lender to charge more for loans and mortgages, but which are expected to fall throughout 2024. TSB is also expecting more customers to struggle to keep up on their repayments, resulting in a 24% jump in cash put aside for potential defaults, to ¬£63m. The lender said it reflected ‚Äúthe uncertain economic outlook, the higher interest rate environment and increasing inflationary pressures on our customers.‚Äù However, TSB‚Äôs CEO Robin Bulloch cheered the bank‚Äôs performance:  ‚ÄúWe are reporting another year of sustained profitability, demonstrating the impact of both our continued focus on customers, delivering products and services that genuinely meet their needs, and the work to make TSB a simpler, more efficient, and resilient bank.‚Äù      10.13am GMT  Eurozone inflation drops to 2.8%  Newsflash: Inflation in the eurozone has fallen back, partly reversing December‚Äôs jump.

Data firm S&P Global Insight‚Äôs latest survey of purchasing managers shows that the downturn in the UK manufacturing sector continued in January. UK firms reported that supply chain difficulties rose, as shipping firms rerouted vessels away from the Suez Canal following the attacks by Houthi rebels. Some firms estimated that a minimum of 12-18 days could be added to vendor lead times for goods ordered from the Asia‚ÄìPacific region.   Related: Global trade falls amid Houthi attacks on merchant ships in Red Sea   Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:  ‚ÄúCost and stock management initiatives are being complicated by the Red Sea crisis. Diverting purchased inputs, especially those sourced from the APAC region, around the Cape of Good Hope is raising prices and extending supplier lead times. Some of our panel members estimate that a minimum of 12-18 days could be added to some expected deliveries, disrupting production schedules and raising inflationary pressures at a time when manufacturers are already struggling with weak demand both at home and overseas. One small ray of light from the January data is manufacturers expect some of these issues may be temporary, with an increasing number (over 50%) still forecasting output to be higher 12 months out.‚Äù  Manufacturers also reported that output and new orders fell again last month, leading to additional job losses and cutbacks in purchasing and stock holdings.

Hunt, who in November announced he was cutting the main rate of national insurance contributions paid by employees from 12% to 10%, was widely believed to be gearing up for another tax giveaway after dropping a series of hints about what could be the Conservatives‚Äô last budget before a general election. However, the chancellor said he needed to manage expectations.  Hunt told the BBC‚Äôs Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast:  ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look to me like we will have the same scope for cutting taxes in the spring budget that we had in the autumn statement.‚Äù    Related: Jeremy Hunt plays down talk of spring budget tax cut after IMF warning       9.14am GMT  Eurozone manufacturing downturn cools in January  The eurozone‚Äôs factory sector has shrunk again, but at a slower rate, as Red Sea disruption leads to supply delays. Data provider S&P Global Insight reports that the slump in the eurozone‚Äôs manufacturing sector eased in January, with factory output and new orders declining at their softest rates since last April.  Its latest survey of purchasing managers shows that cutbacks to purchasing activity, stocks of inputs and employment also cooled, while business confidence rose to a nine-month high.

This can and should be funded in part through a windfall tax on the fossil fuel companies fuelling the climate crisis and driving up energy prices.‚Äù      8.47am GMT   The last two years‚Äô energy price boom has seen oil giants like BP and Shell and their investors emerge as winners ‚Äì at the expense of people and the planet, warns Sophie Flinders, data analyst at Common Wealth:  Shell has U-turned on climate targets and instead has committed to increasing their oil and gas production.

Updated at 9.07am GMT    8.02am GMT  Bank of England decision: What the analysts expect  BoE policymakers could be split three ways when they set interest rates today, predicts Michael Hewson of CMC Markets:  No changes are expected to monetary policy today with the main question being around whether our resident hawks decide to vote with the majority for no change and temper their hawkishness. Of the 19 meetings Catherine Mann has voted in she has voted to increase the base rate at 17 of them so a hold will be a rare event for her. There is also the possibility of a dovish outlier with the potential for Swathi Dhingra voting for a rate cut, prompting a split in the opposite direction to what we saw in December. Since joining the MPC, Dhingra has only voted to raise rates twice in the 11 meetings she has voted in, so if anyone is going to break ranks and starting voting to cut rates it will be her.  Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, expects the Bank of England to start opening the door to interest rate cuts later this year.  The Bank of England (BoE) has been the most hawkish of major central banks and this has made Sterling one of the best recent currency performers. With UK inflation still double its 2% target, economic growth has been better-than-feared, and the government set for more tax cuts at its March budget. But enough inflation-fighting progress has been made for the BoE to begin opening the door to lower interest rates starting this summer, with four cuts likely in the second half. This would lag behind the US Fed and Europe‚Äôs ECB but be welcome, and borrowers have already started to benefit from the fall in bond yields.  However, Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at T. Rowe Price, predicts the Bank will sound hawkish today, and signal that the markets are expecting too many rate cuts:  In December, UK inflation turned out to be stickier than expected, while survey data suggested a rebound in output and employment in the services sector. Mortgage approvals have begun to rise and mortgage rates are now falling, which will allow the mortgage and housing market to recover further over the next 6-12 months. Economic activity will continue to rebound over the next couple of months as a result of the 2% National Insurance cut, which became effective at the beginning of the year. This will raise demand in the economy, while any additional tax cuts may increase demand further.

Maja Darlington, Campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:  ‚ÄúFires are raging across Colombia, Britain has been wracked by floods, 2023 smashed global temperature records, but Shell is posting yet more obscene profits from climate-wrecking fossil fuels. While customers struggle with the cost-of-living crisis, Shell shovels over $20bn to shareholders and drills for yet more oil and gas, climate disasters are multiplying and hitting hardest those who have done the least to cause the crisis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to end the fossil fuel party. It would take the average British worker over 640,000 years to earn as much as Shell did last year. Our government must make oil companies like Shell stop drilling and start using their immense wealth to pay for the damage they are causing, before all our futures go up in flames.‚Äù   Updated at 9.01am GMT    7.42am GMT   Shell has beaten City profit expectations, by posting earnings of $28.25bn for last year. Analysts had expected Shell‚Äôs full-year 2023 net profit to come in at around $27.5bn, reports CNBC.     7.33am GMT  Shell profits drop, but shareholders still benefit  Profits at oil giant Shell have dropped by almost a third, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped it announcing another share buyback scheme and lifting its dividend. Shell has reported annual adjusted profits for 2023 of $28bn, 29% down from its record earnings of almost $40bn in 2022. The drop in profits is due to lower oil and gas prices, lower volumes, and lower refining margins, Shell says. In the last quarter of 2023, Shell made $7.3bn, up from $6.2bn in the third quarter of last year, but lower than the $9.8bn made in Q4 2022. The oil giant has also announced a new share buyback programme of $3.5bn, and is also lifting its dividend by 4%.     7.33am GMT  Introduction: Bank of England rate decision  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. These are tricky times for central bankers. Growth is being held back by high interest rates, while inflation is still over target despite falling back from the peaks of the last two years. So the Bank of England has plenty to ponder, as it prepares to set interest rates at noon today. The City is confident that the Bank will leave interest rates on hold at their current 16-year high of 5.25%. With inflation at 4% ‚Äì twice the BoE‚Äôs 2% target ‚Äì policymakers probably won‚Äôt feel confident easing policy. The money markets reckon there‚Äôs a 99% chance that the Bank holds rates unchanged today, with a 1% possibility of a shock rise to 5.5%. The Bank may also cut its forecast for inflation this year, while investors also expect the BoE to signal when rate cuts are likely to start this year.  The Bank of England is likely on Thursday to deliver a brighter outlook for the UK economy, reducing its forecast for inflation this year and potentially opening the way to interest-rate reductions that could boost growth https://t.co/bmoBKJQBuZ‚Äî Bloomberg Markets (@markets) February 1, 2024  Rates have been held at 5.25% since last August. But the nine members of the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy have been split at recent interest votes ‚Äì with some hawkish members pushing for higher borrowing costs. April LaRusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment, says:  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt expect any change in UK rates tomorrow, but the vote is going to be fascinating. At the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in December three members of the committee voted to increase interest rates to 5.5%. A lot has changed since then; the US Federal Reserve have pivoted to a more dovish outlook and markets are now pricing in a series of UK interest rate cuts starting in May. With inflation now considerably below the Banks own forecasts we expect a shift in tone ‚Äì but the Bank is going to face a tricky job to keep market perceptions on a realistic path.‚Äù    Related: Bank of England expected to hold rates and warn on inflation   Last night, America‚Äôs Federal Reserve left interest rate on hold, while Fed chair Jerome Powell tried to cool expectations that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates as soon as March. Powell insisted a March cut was not the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúbase case‚Äù, seen as an indication that the Fed could delay easing monetary policy until May. That, and jitters about the health of US regional bank New York Community Bancorp, knocked stocks in New York last night. It cut its dividend and posted a surprise loss, renewing fears over the health of similar lenders. The S&P 500 index of US shares lost 1.6%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2%. Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet, lost 7% after missing advertising revenue targets in its latest results.  The S&P 500 extended its losses and fell 1.6% today after #Fed Chair Jerome Powell ruled out rate cuts starting as soon as March ‚Äì a hawkish stance relative to market expectations, in my view.

Related: Online travel agent allows customers to filter out Boeing 737 Max planes   The company has been fighting to reassure regulators, airlines and passengers since a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet was forced into an emergency landing last month. The dramatic incident during an Alaska Airlines flight ‚Äì which prompted 171 Max 9 jets to be grounded for several weeks ‚Äì has sparked the biggest safety crisis for Boeing since the crashes of two of its Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. ‚ÄúI would absolutely not fly a Max airplane,‚Äù Ed Pierson, a former senior manager on Boeing‚Äôs 737 program, told the LA Times. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked in the factory where they were built, and I saw the pressure employees were under to rush the planes out the door. I tried to get them to shut down before the first crash.‚Äù Pierson, who left Boeing in 2018 and is now executive director at the Foundation for Aviation Safety, expressed concern about the way in which regulators permitted the Max 9 to return to service last week. He told ABC7 San Francisco: ‚ÄúIf you had a new car that had a part fall off of it and you had to pull over to the side of the road, and then you went to the shop, and the mechanic said, ‚ÄòHey, I‚Äôm finding some other things wrong with it, but here you go, ready to go get out on the road,‚Äô you would probably have some questions about [whether] anything else [has] been missed. So that‚Äôs a concern that we‚Äôve had.‚Äù Although Boeing insists it has taken steps to strengthen its safety and quality processes in recent years, its chief executive, Dave Calhoun, acknowledged on Wednesday that the company has ‚Äúmore work to do‚Äù as it attempts to repair its reputation. ‚ÄúI would tell my family to avoid the Max,‚Äù Joe Jacobsen, an engineer who worked at Boeing for a decade until 1995, also told the LA Times. ‚ÄúI would tell everyone, really.‚Äù Jacobsen later worked at the Federal Aviation Administration, and is now an advocate for aviation safety. Pierson described intense pressure faced by employees working on the Max production line. ‚ÄúEverybody can relate to schedule pressure in any job,‚Äù he told ABC7, ‚Äúbut when you‚Äôre building an airplane, you can‚Äôt afford to have those kinds of issues.‚Äù Boeing declined to comment on Pierson‚Äôs remarks. Last week, Stan Deal, president of the company‚Äôs commercial airplanes division, said winning back the confidence of ‚Äúcustomers, our regulator and the flying public‚Äù was its long-term focus. ‚ÄúFrankly, we have disappointed and let them down,‚Äù he wrote to staff."

        "content": "Tesco has found that thousands of tonnes of unwanted food it thought was going to feed animals has instead been used to generate energy, dramatically damaging its progress on reducing food waste. The UK‚Äôs biggest supermarket had said it had cut food waste by 45% between the 2016-17 financial year and 2023. But it has been forced to reduce the figure to just 18% after discovering that an unnamed food waste processor breached the terms of its contract. The debacle will be embarrassing for Ken Murphy, the chief executive of Tesco, who in September called for ‚Äúglobal action‚Äù to cut food waste at a UN gathering of business leaders in New York. Murphy‚Äôs long-term share bonus package is also partly linked to Tesco achieving its aim to halve food waste by next year, meaning that he could miss out on more than ¬£300,000 in shares as a result of the problem. In a statement on its website, Tesco said it had ‚Äúterminated our relationship‚Äù with the food waste processor in the UK after the issue was uncovered via an audit. An investigation into the incident is under way, according to The Grocer trade journal, which first reported the issue. Tesco said it was now reviewing how it would achieve its aim to halve food waste. Last year it pledged to meet that target by 2025, five years earlier than previously promised. It said the problem did not relate to food deemed fit for human consumption that it redistributes via partners such as Fareshare and Olio and it continued to ‚Äúwork closely with food redistribution groups and charities to donate as much surplus food to local communities as possible from our stores‚Äù. Claire Lorains, group quality, technical and sustainability director at Tesco, said: ‚ÄúWe have terminated our relationship with our food waste processor in the UK, following an internal review which showed that food which we believed was being processed for animal feed was in fact going to anaerobic digestion. ‚ÄúWhile anaerobic digestion can have a role in recovery of energy and avoids food going to landfill, under the food waste hierarchy, we count food going to anaerobic digestion as waste.‚Äù Anaerobic digestion is a method of breaking down food waste, which also produces renewable energy and avoids carbon emissions."

        "content": "Interest rates have peaked. The next move in borrowing costs will be down. But not yet. Those were the three key messages from the Bank of England in its latest assessment of the state of the economy. Those conclusions may not be immediately apparent from the minutes of the latest meeting on Threadneedle Street of the monetary policy committee (MPC) ‚Äì the body tasked with setting interest rates to hit the government‚Äôs 2% inflation target ‚Äì because the MPC had a three-way split. Six members voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25%, two voted for them to rise to 5.5% while one voted for a reduction to 5%.  Interactive  It is rare for the Bank to be this divided, and in theory rates could still rise further. Interestingly, the last time there was a similar difference of opinion was in August 2008, the month before the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers ushered in the most turbulent phase of the global financial crisis. Rates were subsequently cut aggressively. A repeat of the rapid easing of policy seen in 2008 is not on the cards right now, but the financial markets will read the runes. Assuming the economy pans out according to the Bank‚Äôs forecasts, the City will be pencilling in a cut in rates in late spring. In November last year, the MPC said it stood ready to raise interest rates should inflationary pressure prove more persistent. In fact, there has been better news on inflation and that language has now been dropped. What‚Äôs more, the Bank‚Äôs forecasts show that leaving rates at 5.25% would push the UK into a two-year recession lasting until the end of 2025 and for inflation to be well below its 2% target. Given those projections, it would be a little strange for the Bank to pretend that no discussions were taking place on the possibility of rate cuts. On the other hand, the fact that inflation peaked at more than 11% and has taken time to come down inevitably makes the Bank cautious about easing policy too quickly. The MPC is particularly focused on the level of pay settlements and inflation in the service sector ‚Äì both of which are seen as good bellwethers of underlying price pressures. Andrew Bailey, the Bank‚Äôs governor, voiced the view of the no-change majority when he said more ‚Äúgood news‚Äù on inflation was required for rates to be cut. The Bank has been surprised by the extent to which price pressures have eased in recent months and it now believes lower energy prices will bring inflation temporarily back to its 2% target by May. But it then thinks it will rise again to 2.75% by the end of the year. ‚ÄúWe need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2%, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates,‚Äù Bailey said. But as with other central banks ‚Äì the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ‚Äì the question is not whether rates have further to rise but when it will be safe for them to be cut. "

        "content": "The Bank of England has dropped the broadest possible hint that the next move in interest rates will be downwards after forecasting inflation will fall below 2% within months, despite keeping borrowing costs unchanged for a fourth consecutive time. Threadneedle Street stressed that more evidence was required that inflation would stick at the target set by the government before the Bank could deliver a first cut to borrowing costs since the start of the pandemic. It warned that risks from fast-rising prices remained amid the cost of living crisis. In a widely expected decision, the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority to keep interest rates at the current level of 5.25%, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. However, one member of the panel ‚Äì the independent economist Swati Dhingra ‚Äì pushed for an immediate reduction in borrowing costs, in a powerful signal to financial markets that the central bank was edging closer to taking action. The Bank issued a sharp downgrade in forecasts for inflation, pencilling in a fall below 2% in May for the first time since early 2021, although it warned it was likely to return above the target rate later this year amid robust pay growth in the British economy and the fading impact from lower energy prices. Andrew Bailey, the Bank‚Äôs governor, said: ‚ÄúWe have had good news on inflation over the past few months. It has fallen a long way, from 10% a year ago to 4%. But we need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.‚Äù Financial markets had predicted rates would be left unchanged for a fourth consecutive time after a steady decline in inflation over recent months, despite a small increase in December from 3.9% to 4%, with City investors anticipating a first rate cut from as early as June. The Bank has left borrowing costs unchanged since September, having paused its most aggressive hiking cycle in decades. The central bank lifted rates from a record low of 0.1% in December 2021, driving up the cost of mortgages and loans for millions of households.  Interactive  The prospect of interest rate cuts will provide a boost for Rishi Sunak as the prime minister prepares to send voters to the polls in a general election expected this autumn. Financial markets are anticipating a reduction in borrowing costs of up to 1 percentage point. Interest rates and inflation falling as financial markets expect would also provide a tailwind for economic growth, with the Bank pencilling in a modest upgrade to its GDP forecasts from zero growth this year to about a quarter of a percentage point. However, it warned inflation was only on track to fall ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù below 2% this spring before rising back to about 2.75% before the end of the year and remaining above the target for the rest of its three-year forecast, fuelled by the ‚Äúpersistence of domestic inflationary pressures‚Äù in the services sector and labour market. It also warned of risks over the coming months from disruption to shipping in the Red Sea amid the Israel-Gaza war, with the potential to drive up consumer prices in Britain. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt expect [inflation at 2%] to be the sustained level. It‚Äôs going to rise somewhat thereafter,‚Äù Bailey said. ‚ÄúThis is not back to 10%, let‚Äôs be clear. But that‚Äôs not an acceptable state of affairs as a resting place, so it‚Äôs important we do the rest of the work.‚Äù Exposing a three-way split on the committee amid concerns over the potential for inflationary pressures becoming entrenched, two members of the MPC ‚Äì the independent economists Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann ‚Äì pushed for a further quarter-point increase in the Bank rate. A majority of six members ‚Äì including Bailey ‚Äì voted to keep rates on hold. Reflecting concerns over stubbornly high inflation, the Bank highlighted robust levels of wage growth expected this year in surveys conducted by its network of agents across the country, which found companies were planning to offer pay settlements of about 5.4% this year, only slightly below the levels seen in 2023. It also insisted that borrowing costs would ‚Äúneed to be restrictive for an extended period‚Äù to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target, while indicating that it was prepared to keep them under review before taking action. Bailey said the question was how long the Bank needed to maintain rates at elevated levels, but added: ‚ÄúIt is too soon to take that decision, we need some more evidence.‚Äù"

The bank revealed its pre-tax profits had tumbled 10% in the fourth quarter, largely due to restructuring costs and a write-down on its takeover of the UK stockbroker Numis, which it agreed to buy in October last year. Full-year pre-tax profits rose 2% to ‚Ç¨5.7bn. However, Deutsche Bank‚Äôs shares were up nearly 4% in morning trading, as it gave a stronger outlook for revenues. The bank is part of a growing list of global banks that have shed thousands of jobs over the past year, particularly after a downturn in market conditions that have hit deal-making, and a shift in customer behaviour that has convinced more consumers to bank online. Some lenders who pledged not to cut jobs during the pandemic, have been cutting their workforce since. Major cuts have been announced by US lenders, including Citibank, which revealed last month that it would be cutting 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026 as part of its own restructuring programme. Barclays is slashing 5,000 jobs across its 84,000-strong global workforce in an effort to boost profits and appease shareholders. Meanwhile, Lloyds Banking Group said last week it was planning to cut 1,600 staff from its branch network as it tried to reduce costs and push customers towards digital services as part of a corporate overhaul. The announcement came weeks after Lloyds confirmed plans to slash nearly 3,000 middle-management roles including analyst and product management posts. Major staff cuts by mainstream US, UK and European banks since January 2023 UK Lloyds Banking Group: More than 4,600 Barclays: More than 5,000 Metro Bank: 800 Nationwide: 470 Europe UBS/Credit Suisse: 13,000 Deutsche Bank: 3,500 US Citigroup: 25,000 Morgan Stanley: 4,800 Wells Fargo: 12,000 JP Morgan: 1,000 Bank of America: 4,000 Goldman Sachs: 3,200"

The company that Elliot, a former co-chair of the Conservative party, set up in 2000, reported pre-tax losses of ¬£1.5m in the year to the end of April 2022, compared with a ¬£3.8m loss a year earlier. However, its post-tax losses increased to ¬£12.9m, up from ¬£8m the previous year. In its much-delayed filing with Companies House on Wednesday night, the company said its group‚Äôs liabilities had ballooned to ¬£29m, up from ¬£23.7m a year earlier. The company warned that if it required more ‚Äúexternal funding‚Äù it ‚Äúmay not be forthcoming and therefore this creates material uncertainty that may ultimately cast doubt about the group and company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern‚Äù. Quintessentially, which in 2016 was reportedly paid ¬£1.4m by the Department for International Trade to make introductions to ‚Äúattract the right high-value individual investors to the UK‚Äù, has borrowed more than ¬£12m from its largest shareholder, World Kinect Corporation (formerly known as World Fuel Services).

The company, which has promised it can source for its clients everything from a pet jellyfish to a Batcave, reported turnover of ¬£27.4m in the year to the end of April 2022. That is up from ¬£18.6m a year earlier. The firm had reportedly told its staff it expected to make a ¬£2.4m profit in the year to April 2022, which would have been its highest in a decade. In its 2019 accounts, Quintessentially admitted to making ¬£7m in accounting errors and paying out ¬£1.4m in unlawful dividends.

        "content": "The Czech billionaire whose company takes over running the UK national lottery from Thursday is still in business with the Kremlin-owned gas company Gazprom, nearly two years after promising regulators he would sever ties with Russia. The Gambling Commission awarded Allwyn the lucrative 10-year licence to run the lottery, estimated to be worth up to ¬£100bn in sales, in March 2022. The decision followed a three-way bidding war between Allwyn, media tycoon Richard Desmond, and Camelot, holder of every licence since weekly draws began in 1994. Allwyn, which successfully fended off legal challenges from the losing bidders after the licence was awarded, is ultimately owned by the Czech entrepreneur Karel Kom√°rek, via his holding company KKCG. Kom√°rek has condemned Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù invasion of Ukraine, including in an open letter published in March 2022, as the Gambling Commission was finalising its decision. Allwyn is also understood to have promised the regulator during the bidding process that Kom√°rek would terminate any links with Russia as soon as possible. But both the commission and Allwyn have since faced questions from MPs about Kom√°rek‚Äôs joint venture with Gazprom, which operates the Dambo≈ôice underground gas storage facility in the Czech Republic. Gazprom is not sanctioned in the UK but many of its executives are. MPs on the culture, media and sport committee have also expressed concerns about any lingering ties between Kom√°rek‚Äôs business empire and the Kremlin. In June 2022, Gambling Commission staff told the committee that they expected an announcement about plans to end the relationship within ‚Äúdays‚Äù. However, the plan had not been completed by November last year, a Tortoise podcast revealed. The Guardian has now established that, while Kom√°rek has taken steps to reduce Gazprom‚Äôs stake in the joint venture, the Kremlin-owned gas company still retains a 50% shareholding pending legal approval of a share issue that will dilute its holding to below 3%. Kom√°rek, who grew up in Moravia, where the gas facility was built, became a billionaire in post-Soviet Czech Republic, using a loan from his father as a platform to build an empire spanning oil and gas, property, technology and lotteries. His partnership with Gazprom began in 2013, when Czech firm MND, wholly owned by his Switzerland-based holding company KKCG, entered into a 50:50 partnership with Gazprom to build a gas storage facility in the Czech Republic. The resulting company, Moravia Gas Storage (MGS), carried on with the same equal ownership structure after Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Crimea the following year. But Russia‚Äôs all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is understood to have kickstarted efforts by KKCG to extricate itself from the co-investment with Gazprom. Less than a month later, KKCG-owned Allwyn won the fourth national lottery licence, after offering assurances that it was working to cut any ties Gazprom.  It has since struggled to effect the divorce, despite the Gambling Commission‚Äôs assurances to MPs that an announcement ending the partnership was imminent. In June, shortly after the select committee evidence session, KKCG did announce plans to transfer its shares in the storage facility, held via MND, to the Czech government. However, those discussions broke down and in October 2023, more than a year later, KKCG announced that MGS would issue new shares worth 36m Czech krona (¬£1.2m), all of which would be bought by MND. This, it said, would increase the stake held by Kom√°rek-owned MND to 97.37%, leaving Gazprom Export LLC, a subsidiary of Gazprom, with 2.63%. In November last year, the company received regulatory approval for the transaction although final legal approval to reduce Gazprom‚Äôs stake from 50% is still pending. KKCG is understood to be keen to remove Gazprom from the venture entirely and sources close to the company said its efforts to remove the Russian state gas company had been slowed by regulatory and legal processes. The Gambling Commission declined to comment. In a letter to the culture, media and sport committee, sent in December, the commission said it had been satisfied that Allwyn was not in business with any sanctioned entities and that any Russian interests had no bearing on the lottery. It said that KKCG had made ‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù in cutting ties with Gazprom and had already acted to sell an oil terminal in Russia‚Äôs Samara region. The regulator also said it had worked with UK Security Vetting, the government‚Äôs national security vetting provider. KKCG declined to comment."

        "content": "Bank of England policymakers are expected to hold interest rates at 5.25% when they meet today, but a rapid fall in inflation could mean a cut in the cost of borrowing comes as early as June. Analysts said revised forecasts for inflation were likely to show a steep drop in prices growth over the next six months, prompting bets in financial markets that the Bank‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) will make several cuts to interest rates in the second half of the year. In a move to dampen speculation about an early rate cut, the governor Andrew Bailey is expected to say that wages growth remains strong and that this could prompt a resurgence of inflation. The escalating conflict in the Red Sea could also hit shipments of goods through the Suez canal, putting upward pressure on prices. Business surveys have shown that companies are more confident about revenues and profits this year and house price surveys have shown the property market beginning to recover from a period of stagnation. However, steep falls in energy and fuel prices from all-time highs last year are due to reduce household bills, lowering the overall rate of inflation this year and giving the Bank room to cut interest rates during the summer. Financial markets have already scaled back the possibility of dramatic cuts in interest rates this year. Until last month, investors were betting on six 0.25 percentage point reductions starting in May, which would push rates to below 4% by the end of 2024. Ahead of the MPC meeting, investors expected the Bank would carry out only four rate cuts from June. Analysts at Investec said the Bank would be even more circumspect than financial markets predict about an early move to reduce interest rates. ‚ÄúOur base case is that the MPC will cut rates three times this year, beginning in June, with the [main] rate ending this year at 4.50%.‚Äù Highly indebted businesses and households are likely to be disappointed by predictions of a slow path of interest rate cuts. S&P, the rating agency, has warned that many large corporations that were able to hedge their interest rate costs during the pandemic could find themselves unable to meet debt payments should rates still be high next year. Households that must refinance their mortgages will also be hit by higher bills. Mortgage rates have fallen over the last few months in response to speculation that interest rates will tumble. But this trend could reverse if rates stay high for a longer period. Karen Ward, chief market strategist for Europe at JP Morgan Asset Management, warned the Bank not to focus unduly on falling fuel costs and to resist interest rate cuts unless wages growth falls back. ‚ÄúIf the labour market is still generating medium-term inflationary pressures, then cutting interest rates would be the wrong thing to do. Why? Sticky wage growth would be a sign that the labour market and broader economy is already at full capacity. ‚ÄúFalling inflation in itself could lead to a real wage boost and a re-acceleration in spending, above what the economy can cope with. Indeed, there is already some evidence of this re-acceleration in the business surveys. Adding rate cuts might further fuel the underlying capacity problem,‚Äù she added."

Under the offer, one grandparent on the trip can travel free of charge to countries including Spain, Greece and Italy. The tour operator said it hoped the deal would encourage Britons to take a holiday with three generations of their family or more. Matt Callaghan, the chief operating officer at easyJet Holidays, said it was proud to offer ‚Äúthousands of free kids places‚Äù but also wanted ‚Äúto recognise the grandparents‚Äù. Travel trade publications are calling multigenerational holidays one of the industry‚Äôs biggest post-pandemic trends amid a renewed desire among younger generations to holiday with parents.   Related: ‚ÄòWhy would we stop holidaying together?‚Äô Three families on the joy of travelling with adult children   A poll of 2,000 British adults, found more than half of those surveyed (56%) said they regretted not spending more time with grandparents and 54% said they were hoping to bring them on future holidays. More than half (59%) of those surveyed said they wanted to spend more time with the older generations in their family, with 57% saying they wanted to make holiday memories with grandparents. Callaghan said: ‚ÄúThis research shows how important grandparent and grandchild relationships are and how much can be learned from making time for them. We‚Äôve launched our ‚Äògrans go free‚Äô offer to tighten these important family relationships.‚Äù The polling also found that 77% of people agreed that the bond between grandparents and grandchildren was one of the most special relationships within a family ‚Äì yet 27% said they spoke to their grandparents less than once a week. The offer starts on 1 February and will be available for a limited number of customers. EasyJet Holidays said some additional spaces would also open on Monday. To qualify, the grandparent must be travelling as part of a family booking with at least one child. Proof of age and relation will be taken upon arrival at the destination hotel. EasyJet Holidays says the most popular destinations for a multigenerational holiday abroad are Spain, Italy and France. More than half of those polled said they would probably let their grandparents pick the destination if they were planning a trip together. For 45%, the grandparents in the family are the bigger earners, but despite this only 35% would expect a grandparent to contribute financially if they came on holiday with them, wanting to treat them instead. If they were to contribute, 39% of those surveyed would ask them to cover just their share of the holiday, while 21% would ask only that they pay for a meal or two on the trip."

The latest quarterly CPI figures released by the Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed annual inflation has fallen from 5.4% in the September quarter to just 4.1% in the December quarter of 2023:    If this graph does not display, click here That fall is the biggest drop ‚Äì outside the 2020 lockdowns ‚Äì for more than a decade. It means inflation is going down almost as fast as it went up.

On this measure ‚Äì which excludes a few items with prices that don‚Äôt generally change week to week or month to month, such as education costs ‚Äì estimated inflation in the past year rose only 3.4%. That is not only just a touch above the Reserve Bank‚Äôs target, it also puts us right next to the US:   Related: The old stage-three cuts are dead. Long live Labor‚Äôs new policy, which 90% of Australians will cheer | Greg Jericho      If this graph does not display, click here One criticism you may have heard from some sectors is that Australia‚Äôs inflation has been well above that of the US. Well, no more. On the monthly measure, US inflation rose 3.3% compared with our 3.4% and, even better, our inflation has been falling for the past six months, while in the US it has hit a plateau. But before we all get giddy, let‚Äôs not forget that it is easy to fall into the trap of only caring about the past year‚Äôs figures and forgetting what came before them. That prices only rose 4.1% (or even 3.4%) across 2023 does not remove the price increases that happened in 2022 and 2021. If the RBA is right and wage growth in the year to December last year will come in at 4%, that will still mean that over the past three years, while wages have risen a total of 10%, prices will have gone up 16.1%. That means the average wage is buying about 6% fewer things than it could in 2020. That will take a long time to recover. And even while inflation overall is now about the level of wage growth, it is worth noting that in the past 12 months the prices of non-discretionary items ‚Äì those things you can‚Äôt avoid buying or paying for (energy bills, food, insurance and rent, etc) ‚Äì rose 4.8%.    If this graph does not display, click here Because lower-income households spend a greater share of their income on these essentials, yet again, they have been hurt more than richer households who can afford to spend a larger share of their income on non-discretionary items such as holidays, eating out at restaurants or buying stuff at hardware or electrical stores.   Related: The stage-three tax cut changes could be a pivotal moment for Anthony Albanese ‚Äì if he frames them right | Peter Lewis   Of the 12 biggest contributors to overall inflation in the last six months of 2023 (which, combined, made up 90% of all inflation), eight were non-discretionary items:    If this graph does not display, click here This just reaffirms the decision by the Albanese government to reconfigure the stage-three tax cuts to give more to low-middle income earners who have been hit hardest by inflation. Of course, rental price growth has been the big issue for many Australians and the past two years have been brutal:    If this graph does not display, click here On the mainland, Canberra‚Äôs rental price growth has remained below CPI. Perhaps it‚Äôs no coincidence the ACT has rental price caps.  One key aspect of these numbers is that they don‚Äôt really take into account the November interest rate rise. It always takes a few months for the impact of a rate rise to flow through the economy. These figures would suggest the RBA hit inflation as it was already going down, and going down fast. The risk of course is that could be overkill and the rate rises cause unemployment to increase quickly. One sign the rate rise in November was not needed was that the retail trade figures for December, also released this week, show a big fall in our spending. This was in part due to ‚Äì as I noted last month ‚Äì our habits shifting to shopping at the Black Friday sales. But even when you count the total spending in October, November and December in 2023 compared with the same periods in 2022, retail spending grew only 1.4%:    If this graph does not display, click here That 1.4% growth is well below the 3% average growth of the pre-pandemic years. That is not a sign of a strong economy filled with households flush with cash. It is not a sign of an economy where strong demand is driving up prices. Instead, it shows that households were already doing it tough and were already stopping their spending right at the moment the RBA decided we needed one more whack. Inflation no longer seems to be a worry, but the economic health of households remains a concern. Let us hope the RBA does not believe we need any more hammering.

        "content": "Mike Lynch, the technology tycoon once lauded as the UK‚Äôs answer to Bill Gates and now facing criminal fraud charges in the US, is suing the Serious Fraud Office. Lynch, who was extradited to the US last year to face trial over allegations he duped Hewlett-Packard into overpaying when it struck an $11bn (¬£8.6bn) deal to buy his software firm Autonomy in 2011, has filed a data protection claim against the SFO in the high court in London. Details of the case have yet to be made public but Lynch, whose trial in the US is due to start on 18 March, has hired the law firm Pallas Partners to pursue the legal action against the director of the SFO, Nick Ephgrave. A spokesperson for Lynch declined to comment on the case. After the Autonomy deal, Hewlett-Packard took an $8.8bn writedown in the firm‚Äôs value after discovering what it called ‚Äúserious accounting improprieties‚Äù, blaming Lynch for perpetrating a $5bn fraud, an accusation he denies. In 2022, Lynch lost a six-year civil fraud case in the UK, with the high court judge ruling that HP had been induced into overpaying for the takeover because of fraud perpetrated by Lynch and Autonomy‚Äôs former finance director Sushovan Hussain, who is in jail in the US after being found guilty of fraud relating to the same deal. Lynch has now been charged by the US government with 17 counts of fraud over the deal, which enriched the billionaire by about $800m. The SFO opened an investigation into Autonomy and Lynch in 2013 but ended it in 2015, saying there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction of the software firm‚Äôs former executive. The SFO then ceded jurisdiction over aspects of the case to US authorities. Evidence provided by the SFO, which was also at one time an Autonomy customer, has been used in the US case against Lynch. The SFO deal with Autonomy is one of dozens of deals that US prosecutors have said they intend to use as evidence. The SFO has refused Lynch‚Äôs request for the data which has prompted the legal action. Anthony Hanratty, a senior associate at the law firm Withers, said: ‚ÄúDuring UK extradition proceedings, a lawyer for the SFO provided a statement of belief to the court that the UK was not the most appropriate forum for the prosecution, although the SFO had previously investigated the matter before ceding control to the US, citing evidential issues.‚Äù  Hanratty added: ‚ÄúAccess to any material relating to the defendant which was the basis for such a decision could result in valuable evidence being obtained which would not ordinarily be disclosed during the trial process.‚Äù The SFO says it did not oppose Lynch‚Äôs extradition to the US for reasons including that it was practical for all the prosecutions to take place in one jurisdiction, where HP is based. Lynch, who has pleaded not guilty and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, is now under house arrest in San Francisco. After landing in the US, Lynch was accompanied by the United States Marshals Service and a court ordered him to pay a $100m bond and called in 24-hour armed guards, deeming the billionaire to be a flight risk."

Related: US economic growth ends 2023 with surprising strength   Policymakers at the central bank, who have signaled they expect to cut rates three times this year, opted to keep rates steady at a 23-year high after their first two-day meeting of 2024. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, also pushed back strongly against the idea that it could start reducing rates as early as March. But officials are edging closer towards ordering the first rate cut since 2020. In a statement, the Fed said the factors behind its goals for inflation and employment were ‚Äúmoving into better balance‚Äù. It comes as price rises are easing, unemployment remains low and economic growth remains largely resilient, raising hopes that the Fed will guide the world‚Äôs largest economy to a so-called ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. Powell has cautioned that a declaration of victory would be premature. ‚ÄúInflation is still too high, the ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain,‚Äù he told reporters on Wednesday. The central bank has held rates between 5.25% and 5.5% since July. After this week‚Äôs meeting, it said its rate-setting policy committee ‚Äúdoes not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%‚Äù. It is trying to strike a delicate balance: moving ‚Äútoo soon or too much‚Äù on rates could reverse progress on inflation, Powell observed, but ‚Äútoo late and too little‚Äù action would risk knocking the economy. Inflation has weakened. The consumer price index, which peaked above 9% in June 2022, stood at 3.4% in December, according to official data. But many Americans are still grappling with the heightened cost of living, and price growth remains above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. Fed officials will closely scrutinize employment data for January, due out on Friday. The US economy added 2.7m jobs last year, defying fears of a downturn in the face of the Fed‚Äôs aggressive campaign against inflation. Wall Street came under pressure after Wednesday‚Äôs announcement. The S&P 500 slipped 0.8% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%. At a press conference, Powell noted that ‚Äúalmost every‚Äù Fed policymaker believes it will be appropriate to reduce rates later this year. ‚ÄúWe feel like inflation is coming down, growth has been strong, the labor market has been strong,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we are trying to do is identify a place where we are really confident about inflation getting back down to 2%, so we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level [of rates].‚Äù The central bank is scheduled to hold its next rate-setting meeting in March. Powell all but knocked down the prospect of a rate cut so soon. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to lower rates,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs to be seen.‚Äù"

        "content": "‚ÄúWas the world‚Äôs richest man overpaid?‚Äù begins Kathaleen McCormick in her ruling from the Delaware court of chancery. You bet. An incentive package worth up to $55.8bn for Elon Musk at Tesla in 2018 was over the top, unnecessary to secure the great man‚Äôs services and thus ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to other shareholders because of the dilutive effect on their holdings. Read the 200-page judgment and it‚Äôs hard to disagree with any step in her argument. Musk and his fanclub are enraged, naturally. ‚ÄúI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,‚Äù said Tesla‚Äôs chief executive. And it‚Äôs true that shareholders approved the scheme by a 73% majority back in 2018. Some said on Musk‚Äôs X that they‚Äôd happily do so again today because he hit his performance-related targets and Tesla‚Äôs value improved by a turbo-charged $600bn. (Back in 2018, remember, the electric vehicle company was worth $50bn-ish and there was a lively debate in the investment world about whether it would soon run out of money.) Yet the objection that shareholders signed off the whole thing misses the nuances, and careful stages, in McCormick‚Äôs ruling. Step one was to show that Musk‚Äôs 22% stake in Tesla gave him controlling status, meaning enormous influence. That wasn‚Äôt hard to show: Musk was chairman and ‚Äúsuperstar CEO‚Äù and ‚Äúenjoyed thick ties with directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla‚Äù. Step two was to ask, given the controlling status, whether the incentive package was fair. Delaware courts can shift the burden of proof when a transaction is approved by a ‚Äúfully informed‚Äù vote of other shareholders, but that‚Äôs where Tesla and the defendants started to fall down. The company‚Äôs proposal ‚Äúinaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process‚Äù. The judge is surely spot-on about the lack of independence. Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director negotiating for Tesla, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group, Antonio Gracias, had a 20-year one and regularly went on holiday with Musk‚Äôs family. A third member was the company‚Äôs general counsel, Todd Maron, who was Musk‚Äôs former divorce lawyer and ‚Äúwhose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition‚Äù. That set-up just looks too cosy. It was also a reason why McCormick concluded that the process behind the award was ‚Äúdeeply flawed‚Äù. In essence, Musk proposed the size and structure of his potential rewards and the compensation committee achieved concessions that weren‚Äôt true concessions in the judge‚Äôs view. Thus the argument moved on to the fairness of the award in terms of price. The board members argued that they wanted to set Tesla up for transformational growth and that Musk‚Äôs continued leadership was essential. McCormick knocked down the ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù appeal of that argument with a series of commonsense points. First, given Musk‚Äôs one-fifth stake, he already had ‚Äúevery incentive‚Äù to attempt transformation because a $50bn increase in Tesla‚Äôs market value would be worth $10bn to him. Second, he had no plan to leave. Third, the incentive scheme didn‚Äôt even require him to devote a set amount of time to Tesla. ‚ÄúSwept up by the rhetoric of ‚Äòall upside‚Äô, or perhaps starry eyed by Musk‚Äôs superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8bn question: was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?‚Äù asked the judge. Yes, that‚Äôs the nub of it. In being so lavish, the directors short-changed ordinary shareholders. The court order says the share options must be voided. Tesla may appeal or produce a new proposal (with correct disclosures on independence, one hopes). In the meantime, though, applaud a judgment that injects a dose of sanity into the process of awarding executive rewards at quoted companies ‚Äì a process that has become so inflationary, in part, because independent directors have taken timidity to new depths. ‚ÄúWhen seeking directors, CEOs don‚Äôt look for pit bulls. It‚Äôs the cocker spaniel that gets taken home,‚Äù another rich man, Warren Buffett, said a few years ago. Absolutely right. The job of independent director is meant to be about representing the interests of all shareholders. If you can‚Äôt act independently, you should not be there. Do not behave like members of a cult, which is roughly what happened at Tesla. Come on ‚Äì $55.8bn was always absurd."

        "content": "FTX has abandoned efforts to restart its crypto exchange, instead opting to liquidate all assets and return funds to customers, a company attorney said on Wednesday. The exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, has been negotiating for months with potential bidders and investors, but none were willing to put in enough money to rebuild it, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich said at a bankruptcy court hearing in Delaware. The failed negotiations underscored the fact that FTX was never what it appeared to be, and that Bankman-Fried never built the underlying technology or administration necessary to run the company as a viable business, Dietderich said.   Related: The problem with Sam Bankman-Fried? We wanted to believe in him | Josie Cox   Bankman-Fried has been convicted on fraud charges related to his operation of FTX. He faces decades in prison. ‚ÄúFTX was an irresponsible sham created by a convicted felon,‚Äù Dietderich said. ‚ÄúThe costs and risks of creating a viable exchange from what Mr Bankman-Fried left in a dumpster were simply too high.‚Äù The company will instead focus on liquidating its assets to repay customers whose cryptocurrency deposits were locked when the company filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. FTX has recovered over $7bn in assets to repay customers, and it has reached agreements with government regulators who have agreed to wait until customers are fully repaid before attempting to collect on about $9bn in claims, Dietderich said. It said it expected to pay all customers in full, although it will calculate their repayment based on cryptocurrency prices from November 2022, when the cryptocurrency market was suffering a prolonged slump. Dozens of customers have complained that they are being shortchanged by the use of November 2022 prices. The price of bitcoin has risen to about $43,300 from its November 2022 price of $16,872, for example. In November, a Manhattan federal jury found Bankman-Fried guilty on seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried, 31, siphoned ‚Äústolen funds‚Äù to make himself rich and cover Alameda‚Äôs high-risk investments, and boosted his luxury lifestyle with ‚Äúexorbitant spending unrelated‚Äù to FTX operations like $100m in political contributions and A-list celebrity endorsements, according to the indictment. This also included footing the bill for personal expenses such as $200m in Bahamas property and repaying loans given to Alameda, which faced an $8bn budget shortfall as the crypto market cratered in 2022. Bankman-Fried was accused of swindling FTX customers out of about $10bn. Prosecutors said that his fraud extended from 2019 to November 2022, when FTX collapsed under the weight of a liquidity crisis, caused by the lending of customer funds to Alameda Research, FTX‚Äôs sister hedge fund, without telling them. Bankman-Fried admitted to ‚Äúlarge mistakes‚Äù in his management of the exchange during his testimony, including never putting a risk management team in place. He attempted to evade prosecutors‚Äô questions with many statements of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall‚Äù only to be confronted with on-the-record statements he had made during his media interviews following the collapse. He faces a long prison term at a sentencing hearing that the US district judge Lewis Kaplan has set for 28 March."

        "content": "Morrisons is inviting shoppers to management meetings and holding monthly customer roundtables in stores as part of a strategy to ‚Äústart a new chapter‚Äù for the struggling supermarket chain under its new boss. Rami Baiti√©h, who took over from David Potts as the chief executive of Morrisons in November, said he would announce new plans for the business in March, adding that ‚Äúlistening to customers and colleagues will show us the way‚Äù. The Bradford-based chain has struggled amid heavy competition with rivals on price and the cost of servicing heavy debts since its ¬£7bn takeover by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in 2021. The German-owned discounter Aldi overtook Morrisons to become the UK‚Äôs fourth largest grocer in 2022. ‚ÄúWe are developing plans to reinvigorate, refresh and strengthen Morrisons and to start a new chapter,‚Äù said Baiti√©h, the former head of the France‚Äôs Carrefour chain who has a reputation as a turnaround expert. ‚ÄúSince the pandemic, Morrisons has not been on peak form. Our market share has slipped slowly and consistently and [underlying] sales have been below the pack for a while,‚Äù he said. Under a new regime intended to draw back shoppers, Baiti√©h said Morrisons would not have any major meetings without the presence of a customer panel that could offer insights into where it could improve. The customers will give views on pricing, service and products at the chain asking questions of management, and being asked their opinions by executives. Baiti√©h said the voice of store managers would also be given more emphasis within the business to gain insight from the shop floor. He said all stores would have monthly shopper roundtables and those that were particularly ‚Äúchallenged‚Äù would host one every week. ‚ÄúWe are beginning to have a new mindset in the company, a high performance culture,‚Äù he said. Baiti√©h said there was ‚Äúwork to do‚Äù on improving quality, price, ranges and profit margins, but he was ‚Äúconfident that Morrisons has the people, the talent, the assets and the desire to chart a bright future in UK grocery‚Äù. Morrisons said on Wednesday that sales had risen 3.3% in the three months to the end of October 2023 on the same period a year earlier ‚Äì well behind the rate of inflation. The UK‚Äôs fifth largest grocer, which has about 500 supermarkets, said its pace of growth had improved throughout last year so that total sales rose 2.7% to ¬£14.9bn in the year to the end of October. Underlying sales growth, which excludes the impact of store openings and closures, rose 1.8% for the year, indicating a fall in the amount of goods sold as food price inflation was more than 5% throughout the year. Annual underlying profits rose 6.5% to ¬£970m, but that figure does not include interest payments on Morrisons‚Äô debts of about ¬£5.5bn, which are thought to top ¬£400m a year. The chief financial officer, Joanna Goff, said the group had produced a pre-tax profit, before exceptional costs and benefits but declined to give an exact figure. She said the figure was an improvement on the previous year, when the company made a ¬£1.5bn pre-tax loss after finance costs of ¬£593m. The company said it had raised ¬£450m during the year from the sale and leaseback of assets, including its warehouses, and generated more than ¬£540m of cash. Earlier this week, the group sold off its petrol forecourts business to sister company MFG for ¬£2.5bn. The deal will hand Morrisons almost ¬£2bn and Goff said the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of that would go towards reducing the company‚Äôs debt pile, which would in turn reduce interest payments, freeing up cash to invest in prices, ranges and improved stores. The deal also leaves Morrisons with a 20% stake in MFG and Baiti√©h said a plan to install electric car charging points alongside the petrol forecourts near Morrisons stores would help attract shoppers. About 2,000 workers from the petrol forecourts will also return to Morrisons‚Äô main stores as part of the deal. The forecourts will be run by franchisees. There had been rumours that the business was considering selling off its food-processing arm, which includes 18 facilities including vegetable packhouses and abattoirs, in order to raise further cash amid rising interest rates on its debts. However, Baiti√©h said that division was central to his plans for the group and gave it a ‚Äúcompetitive advantage‚Äù against rivals, which did not have equivalent facilities. He said he wanted to make that part of the group more efficient and innovative and highlight its benefits more to shoppers."

        "content": "Businesses across the UK have been forced to pay an extra 10% on average for their gas and electricity because suppliers routinely add third-party broker commissions to their bills, according to a leading litigation law firm. Thousands of small businesses have joined a group legal action, led by the law firm Harcus Parker, to claw back up to ¬£2bn in undisclosed broker fees added to their energy bills. The commissions, which can in the most extreme cases be 60% of the energy costs, have heaped pressure on small companies already struggling to cope with the surge in energy prices caused by Russia throttling gas supplies to Europe after the invasion of Ukraine. The law firm claims that more than a million small businesses may have been forced to pay inflated prices over the past decade because suppliers include in the bill the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù fees or commissions charged by the energy brokers that market their deals. Customer bills often do not disclose that a fee has been added or the level at which it has been charged. Damon Parker, a partner at Harcus Parker, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve examined thousands of bills for customers joining our claim and it‚Äôs been quite shocking, in percentage terms, how much these secret commissions have added to their bills.‚Äù The fees piled on to energy bills to pay broker commissions are typically about 1.7p per unit of energy, which often costs around 10p per unit, according to Harcus Parker. On average, the law firm claims, broker fees add about 10% to the total energy bill for small businesses using a broker service. Energy suppliers are under increased scrutiny over their relationship with unregulated third-party brokers that target small business owners. Business groups have said that brokers have been free to ‚Äúrip off‚Äù companies, charities, care homes and faith groups by piling billions of pounds in hidden commission fees on to bills. The Federation of Small Businesses has also claimed that brokers have locked thousands of companies into poor-value long-term energy deals fixed when global market prices were at their peak, meaning they will be forced to pay above the odds even as energy market prices have come down. Harcus Parker has called on the energy regulator to force suppliers to come clean on the fees they pass on to their customers. Since October 2022, it has been mandatory for suppliers to disclose these charges to all ‚Äúmicrobusiness‚Äù customers ‚Äì those with a turnover of less than ¬£1.8m or fewer than 10 employees ‚Äì but small businesses that are slightly larger do not have the same protections. ‚ÄúPeople see a figure of 1p or 2p per unit and think nothing of it, but if this amounts to thousands of pounds over the course of a fixed contract, that [would] really help open customers‚Äô eye,‚Äù Parker said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been calling on Ofgem to make these broker costs transparent for all non-domestic energy customers for nearly a year, and we‚Äôre delighted that they‚Äôve finally listened. That said, others were raising this issue of secret commissions 10 years ago, so I‚Äôm not sure why it has taken so long. ‚ÄúIt seems some brokers were more interested in getting themselves the highest amount of commission possible than getting the customer the best financial deal.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe think a lump sum amount of how much brokers‚Äô commissions will cost companies and organisations will add another layer of transparency.‚Äù The law firm‚Äôs findings come on the day that Ofgem closes a consultation on plans to force major energy companies to disclose the rates they add to bills to cover broker fees. A spokesperson for Ofgem said: ‚ÄúAfter listening to concerns from businesses, Ofgem consulted on changes to supply licence conditions to require full transparency on how much is paid to energy brokers for securing a contract with the customer. ‚ÄúOfgem has asked government to introduce regulation of energy brokers, who fall outside our remit. While this is considered, we are working to ensure that customers are properly informed and protected with appropriate regulation on energy suppliers.‚Äù"

        "content": "The boss of Tata Steel has defended his decision to make thousands of workers redundant at Port Talbot, denying an accusation that ¬£500m in government support represented ‚Äúthe deal of the century‚Äù for the company. TV Narendran, Tata Steel‚Äôs global chief executive, told MPs on Wednesday that the decision to close two blast furnaces at the south Wales site was driven by steep losses at the steelworks, which he said came to ¬£160m in the last quarter. Tata Steel this month announced the blast furnaces would close by the end of summer, to be replaced by a new electric arc furnace part-funded by a ¬£500m government subsidy. The company said the decision would affect 2,500 jobs at Port Talbot and a further 300 at another south Wales site, in Llanwern. The switch will dramatically reduce carbon emissions, but will require far fewer workers, dealing a devastating blow to the town, whose economy and community is dominated by the steelworks. Welsh steelworkers protested against the blast furnace closure outside parliament on Wednesday. Narendran told a hearing of parliament‚Äôs Welsh affairs committee that the government would not consider covering the UK company‚Äôs losses and that shareholders in the Indian-listed parent group had grown weary over the billions of pounds spent on the plant during 15 years of ownership. Stephen Crabb, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: ‚ÄúWe have a plan now which doesn‚Äôt save blast furnaces, doesn‚Äôt save jobs in Port Talbot, and you‚Äôve managed to get UK government to give ¬£500m for it. I mean, that must be the deal of the century for you?‚Äù Unions at the hearing criticised Tata‚Äôs decision. Community, GMB and Unite have all called for the blast furnaces to be kept open for longer. Alasdair McDiarmid, Community‚Äôs assistant general secretary, said: ‚ÄúThe focus has been on price, rather than what‚Äôs best for the country, the industry and the workforce.‚Äù Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said that ‚ÄúTata must change direction‚Äù and wait for a Labour government; the party has promised about ¬£2bn in extra funding for UK steel on top of the ¬£1bn under discussion with Tata and the Chinese-owned British Steel. Narendran said Tata needed more detail on Labour‚Äôs plans. The hearing took place in a room named after Margaret Thatcher, who closed large parts of the UK‚Äôs steel industry in 1980 and privatised the rest.  The Tata decision, along with a similar plan by British Steel to close blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, will represent a new era for the UK as it will leave the country unable to produce steel from iron ore for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. Tata‚Äôs plan for Port Talbot instead relies on using scrap steel from the UK, which is mostly exported. Narendran confirmed that the company would consider investment in direct reduced iron (DRI) technology that could produce net zero iron from ore. DRI could be used with an electric arc furnace and would create hundreds of jobs, although not enough to counterbalance the thousands lost from the blast furnace closures. Narendran said the company would invest in DRI technology only if it could guarantee a good supply of, at first, methane and then zero-emissions hydrogen. He said the Netherlands, where Tata is building a DRI plant, had a supply of methane gas that was lacking in the UK, but MPs on the committee questioned whether the company could use existing gas supplies piped through south Wales from a terminal on the west coast. Narendran said: ‚ÄúAt a later stage if there is an availability of a lot of gas in Port Talbot and at whatever price ‚Ä¶ then we can certainly look at setting up a DRI plant in Port Talbot.‚Äù"

Updated at 1.08pm GMT    11.46am GMT  Novo Nordisk shares rise to record high  Novo Nordisk shares rose as much as 4% to hit a record high after the Danish drugmaker reported soaring sales of its obesity and diabetes drugs and higher profits. This pushed the company‚Äôs market value through $500bn, cementing its position as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, ahead of France‚Äôs luxury goods group LVMH.  Updated at 12.13pm GMT    11.44am GMT  New Morrisons boss says ready to 'start a new chapter' as sales rise 3.3%  Morrisons sales rose 3.3% last autumn, still well behind inflation, as the new boss of the struggling grocer‚Äôs new boss said it was ready to ‚Äústart a new chapter‚Äù. The UK‚Äôs fifth largest supermarket, which has about 500 supermarkets, revealed its pace of growth had improved throughout last year so that total sales rose 2.7% to ¬£14.9bn in the three months to the end of October.  Rami Baiti√©h, who took over from David Potts as chief executive in November, said:   We are developing plans to reinvigorate, refresh and strengthen Morrisons and to start a new chapter.  Underlying sales growth, which excludes the impact of store openings and closures, rose 1.8% indicating a fall in the amount of goods sold as food price inflation was more than 5% throughout the year. Underlying profits rose 6.5% to ¬£970m, but that figure does not include interest payments on Morrisons debts which stand at about ¬£5.5bn. The company said it had raised ¬£450m during the year from the sale and leaseback of assets, including its warehouses, and generated more than ¬£540m of cash. Earlier this week, the group also sold off its petrol forecourts business to sister company MFG (Motor Fuel Group) for ¬£2.5bn. The deal will hand Morrisions almost ¬£2bn to potentially pay down its debts or invest in lowering prices and improving stores. It has meanwhile kept a 20% stake in MFG.     11.27am GMT  China's Country Garden puts 1,000-home London project up for sale  The embattled Chinese property developer Country Garden has put its ¬£450m residential development in East London up for sale, as it flogs assets to raise money following a cash crunch. The property agent Knight Frank said it had been appointed by Risland UK, a subsidiary of Country Garden, to market its 1,000-home development at Calico Wharf in Poplar. Construction has not begun yet. The project has planning approval for several buildings, including a tower of up to 23 storeys, and is slated to include shops as well as homes. Country Garden is the largest private property developer in China, and like other developers is struggling after authorities sought to rein in excessive debt levels from 2021. It defaulted on $11bn of offshore bonds in October and has extended repayments for its onshore notes.

This would mean that TikTok would no longer have access to songs by artists including the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and Canada‚Äôs The Weeknd and Drake. Universal accused TikTok of ‚Äúbullying‚Äù and claimed it wanted to pay just a ‚Äúfraction‚Äù of what other social media sites pay for access to its vast song catalogue. Universal shares fell as much as 3.4%, its biggest intraday decline since October, in Amsterdam and are now trading 1% lower at ‚Ç¨27.39.

Earlier it was dragged lower by share price falls at Vodafone and GSK, while caution ahead of the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate decision tonight (we are expecting no change) and weak Chinese data also weighed on the global mood. Vodafone shares are down 3% after the the French telecoms firm Iliad said its British rival rejected a sweetened proposal to merge their Italian businesses. GSK shares fell 1.2% even though the drugmaker beat market expectations with its 2023 results and it upgraded its outlook. Germany‚Äôs Dax is trading 0.2% lower while France‚Äôs CAC is slightly negative and Italy‚Äôs FTSE MIB has gained 0.8%. Oil prices are falling today as sluggish economic activity in China, the world‚Äôs biggest oil importer, weighed on sentiment. Manufacturing shrank for a fourth straight month in January, an official factory survey showed. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has lost nearly $1 to $81.91 a barrel, down 1.2%. US light crude has fallen 1.3% to $76.81 a barrel.  However, oil prices remain on track for their first monthly gain since September as broadening Middle East conflicts raised concerns over supply. The pound has dipped 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2671.     10.44am GMT   Inflation has declined in six German states that are important to the economy in January, suggesting that national inflation has resumed its downward path and raising hopes for a slowdown in eurozone inflation. The inflation rate in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany‚Äôs most populous state, declined to 3% in January from 3.5% in December. In Bavaria, inflation eased to 2.9% from 3.4%; in Brandenburg to 3.7% from 4.5%; in Saxony, to 3.5% from 4.3%; in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, to 3.2% from 3.8% and in Hessen, to 2.2% from 3.5%. Germany publishes national figures at lunchtime, ahead of eurozone inflation data tomorrow which are expected to show a dip to 2.8% from 2.9%. European Central Bank policymaker Joachim Nagel said yesterday:  I am now convinced that we have tamed that greedy beast.  The ECB is expected to start cutting borrowing costs this spring, as inflation eases.     10.37am GMT   Here is our full story on Fujitsu: Bosses at Fujitsu have apologised to the wrongfully convicted Post Office workers and their families involved in the Horizon IT scandal and said it would work out the amount of compensation when the direction of the public inquiry became clear. Earlier this month, executives at Fujitsu told MPs it would contribute to compensation payments to post office operators who were wrongfully convicted after failures in the Horizon IT software made by the Japanese tech firm made it look like money was missing from their shops. Paul Patterson, Fujitsu‚Äôs boss for Europe, told MPs the company had a ‚Äúmoral obligation‚Äù to pay compensation but did not specify how much should be set aside to pay out. The UK business minister, Kemi Badenoch, wrote to the company to demand talks on how much it would pay.

Momentum, a grassroots organisation of the party‚Äôs leftwing, said:  This is a terrible decision totally out of touch with Labour‚Äôs values and public opinion. For over forty years our economic model has sucked wealth from the country & enriched a few in the City. It even crashed the economy in 2008. Yet instead of learning the lessons from New Labour‚Äôs failures, Starmer & Reeves seem determined to repeat them.  Labour has repeatedly criticised the Tories for removing the cap, so we can expect some comments at prime minister‚Äôs questions today about hypocrisy... Labour MP Darren Jones, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said at the time when the government lifted the cap on bankers‚Äô bonus, that it showed they were ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer previously attacked the plan to remove the cap on bankers‚Äô bonus as amounting to ‚Äúpay rises for bankers, pay cuts for district nurses‚Äù.

Speaking to journalists after the company released better-than-expected 2023 results, she said:  We‚Äôre absolutely delighted with the RSV launch, in four months reaching blockbuster status. We‚Äôre very optimistic about the long term prospects of this asset being at least ¬£3bn. We‚Äôre only 11% penetration so far in the US. We do expect ‚Äò24 to be a year of good growth as we continue to drive penetration. We‚Äôre excited about being able to hopefully add a further cohort of the 50 to 59 year olds.  The RSV vaccine is currently approved for people aged over 60, but GSK is seeking regulatory consent for those aged over 50. RSV, a common respiratory virus, can lead to hospitalisation and death in older adults. GSK has upgraded its outlook and now estimates it can deliver more than ¬£38bn of sales by 2031, compared with its previous forecast of ¬£33bn. It now expects to reach its original 2031 goal by 2026. The vaccine, called Arexvy, was launched in the US in the autumn. It was approved in the UK in July but is not available on the NHS yet. GSK remains in discussions with government. The shot can be bought privately at pharmacies and private clinics. Asked about vaccination rates, Walmsley said:  It will take a few years to get there, to get to the kind of the flu rates which are closer to 60%. And in the UK, we do have the vaccine approved privately. What we‚Äôre looking forward to is to be able to get to national immunisation programmes. The absolute key is this is a fantastic return on investment for any government because it keeps people out of hospital, it creates capacity in GP surgeries. It increases participation in the workforce which actively drives productivity for the country. So we know that every pound or dollar spent on vaccination is very, very well spent even before you talk about the benefits to patients. We‚Äôve been having very positive discussions with the government and we‚Äôre hoping to bring this to the UK public as soon as possible.  The GSK share price is down 1.2% at ¬£15.19 today, but has risen nearly 10% in the past six months.  Updated at 10.07am GMT    9.10am GMT  French inflation eases faster than expected to 3.1%  Inflation in France has eased faster than expected. It came in at 3.1% in January compared with 3.7% in December, according to INSEE, the French statistics office.  January‚Äôs figures are weaker than those forecast by INSEE in mid-December. The fall in inflationary pressure is particularly marked for energy (up by 1.8% year-on-year, compared with 5.7% in December), but also for food (+5.7% year-on-year, compared with +7.2% in December) and manufactured goods, where prices are virtually stable compared with January 2023 (+0.7% year-on-year, compared with +1.4% in December).  Charlotte de Montpellier, senior economist for France and Switzerland at ING, said:  This is clearly a move in the right direction, which should be greeted with relief by the European Central Bank. On the other hand, the rise in services prices was stronger in January, at 3.2% compared with 3.1% the previous month. Looking ahead, the leading indicators suggest that inflation in France will continue to fall over the coming months, although not necessarily continuously. In particular, the contribution of energy to inflation is likely to rise again in the coming months, due to a less favourable base effect for petroleum product prices and the end of various government support mechanisms for energy bills‚Ä¶ Ultimately, we expect inflation to remain close to 3% for the first part of the year, before gradually easing towards 2% in the second half and remaining close to that level in 2025. On average over the year, CPI [consumer prices index] inflation could be close to 2.5%.      8.55am GMT  Fujitsu says UK pullback may hit finances as it apologises again to victims of IT scandal  Japan‚Äôs Fujitsu remains committed to Europe, but said its pullback in the UK following the Horizon IT scandal may hit its financial performance, as it apologised again to subpostmasters and their families. The technology company‚Äôs chief financial officer Takeshi Isobe apologised after the scandal in which hundreds of Post Office workers were wrongly convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of glitches in the software developed by Fujitsu. He said Fujitsu must work to restore its credibility, and reiterated that the firm will refrain from bidding for new UK government projects, but will continue to work on existing projects. Isobe said Fujitsu does not expect an immediate financial impact in its fourth quarter and is trying to figure out the potential impact on its next financial year, which begins in April.

The building society‚Äôs index found that the average house price had increased by 0.7% in January on the previous month ‚Äì a significant turnaround from the December figures, which showed a 1.8% decline in prices. The average UK house price was ¬£257,656 in January, and was down 0.2% on a year earlier.

Rail passengers in the north of England face major disruption on Wednesday as strikes by train drivers stop all Northern and TransPennine Express (TPE) services. The 24-hour strike is the second in a series of rolling stoppages over a week by members of Aslef, the drivers‚Äô union, in the long-running pay dispute. It follows strikes that wiped out the biggest national rail commuter services in southeast England yesterday. Passenger numbers on the tube were down 10% from last Tuesday with many rail commuters unable to reach the capital, according to figures from Transport for London. Both Northern and TPE have warned customers not to attempt to travel on Wednesday as no services will run, including on TPE‚Äôs routes into Scotland. An overtime ban that started on Monday across all the operators in England is also expected to bring more short-notice cancellations to services and potential disruption until next Tuesday.

In the first annual results since the company spun off its consumer healthcare business Haleon (in July 2022), GSK reported a pretax profit of ¬£6.1bn, up 14% at constant exchange rates. Turnover rose 5% to ¬£30.3bn. It made sales of ¬£8.05bn in the final quarter of the year. Emma Walmsley‚Äôs strategy is focused on vaccines, infectious diseases and HIV drugs, with further acquisitions likely to boost the firm‚Äôs pipeline of new medicines. GSK has 71 vaccines and specialty medicines in clinical development, including 18 in late stage trials. Its Arexvy vaccine for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can be serious for children and elderly people, was the first approved RSV vaccine for older adults in May when the US regulator approved it.  The jab has become a blockbuster (with more than $1bn annual sales) and has outshone US rival Pfizer‚Äôs shot Abrysvo. More than a fifth of adults over 60 in the US have been vaccinated with either jab so far. GSK is attempting to lower the age threshold from 60 to 50. The RSV vaccine was launched in the US last autumn and has an estimated two-thirds market share, with sales of more than ¬£1.2bn so far.  It brought in sales of ¬£529m between October and December, while GSK‚Äôs shingles vaccine Shingrix generated ¬£908m. Walmsley said clear highlights in 2023 were the ‚Äúexceptional launch of Arexvy and continued progress in our pipeline‚Äù.  We are now planning for at least 12 major launches from 2025, with new vaccines and specialty medicines for infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory and oncology. As a result of this progress and momentum, we expect to deliver another year of meaningful sales and earnings growth in 2024, and we are upgrading our growth outlooks for 2026 and 2031. We remain focused on delivering this potential - and more - to prevent and change the course of disease for millions of people.  Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said:  GSK has delivered a reminder that it remains a serious player on the global stage, with successful product launches being followed by a strong pipeline of potential new drugs. The long-term potential of the sector is not in question, as moves towards personalised medicine and growing middle classes in emerging markets provide possibilities for endless demand. Meanwhile, the move away from the ‚Äúwhite pills and Western markets‚Äù model , a phrase which Glaxo coined some years ago, is translating into a more specialised business, which was confirmed by the spin-off of its consumer healthcare unit Haleon in 2022.   Updated at 8.34am GMT    7.51am GMT  Shadow chancellor Reeves rules out reinstating bankers' bonus cap  Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said that Labour will not reinstate a cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses that was scrapped lat year by the Conservative government. In a big shift from previous Labour policies, she set out Labour‚Äôs plans to boost economic growth through financial services, which she described as one of the UK‚Äôs greatest assets that the party will ‚Äúunashamedly champion‚Äù.  Bankers‚Äô bonuses were capped at 200% of their regular pay across the EU to deter the excessive risk taking that many say caused the financial crisis. The short-lived Liz Truss government abandoned the bonus cap. Reeves, a former Bank of England economist, told the BBC that she has no plans to reinstate it, despite criticism from the umbrella body for the UK‚Äôs trade unions at the time.  The cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses was brought in in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances. But that has gone now and we don‚Äôt have any intention of bringing that back. And as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.  Reeves said Labour‚Äôs policies will also include closer ties with the EU, expanding finance centres outside London, streamlining regulation and boosting pension investment in UK companies and green technologies.     7.32am GMT  Introduction: UK house prices rise in January, Novo Nordisk obesity drug sales surge ‚Äì business live  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. House prices across the UK rose this month, as buyers took advantage of mortgage rates trending down, according to a survey. The average price of a home increased by 0.7% to ¬£257,656 in January, following no monthly change in December, according to Nationwide building society. Compared with January last year, prices were down just 0.2%, following an annual decline of 1.8% in December. It was the smallest annual drop in a year. Robert Gardner, Nationwide‚Äôs chief economist, said:  There have been some encouraging signs for potential buyers recently with mortgage rates continuing to trend down. This follows a shift in view amongst investors around the future path of Bank rate, with investors becoming more optimistic that the Bank of England will lower rates in the years ahead. These shifts are important as this led to a decline in the longer-term interest rates (swap rates) that underpin mortgage pricing around the turn of the year. However, the partial reversal in recent weeks in response to stronger than expected inflation and activity data cautions that the interest rate outlook remains highly uncertain. While a rapid rebound in activity or house prices in 2024 appears unlikely, the outlook is looking a little more positive. The most recent RICS survey suggests the decline in new buyer enquiries has halted, while there are tentative signs of a pickup in the number of properties coming onto the market.  The Bank of England is expected to keep its base rate at 5.25% on Thursday but may lower some of its inflation forecasts, which could give it room to start cutting rates from the summer. Denmark‚Äôs Novo Nordisk has reported strong revenue growth, with sales of its obesity and diabetes drugs soaring. Obesity drug sales alone jumped 154% at constant exchange rates to 41.6bn Danish kroner (¬£4.8bn) last year, fuelled by demand for Wegovy. Sales of diabetes drugs such as Ozempic grew by 52%, and obesity and diabetes sales together totalled 215bn kroner (nearly ¬£25bn). Overall sales rose 36% to 232bn kroner, while profit before tax jumped 52% to 104.7bn kroner. The company has struggled to keep up with demand and is building more factories. For 2024, sales growth is expected to be 18-26% at constant exchange rates, and operating profit growth is expected to be 21-29%. Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, president and chief executive, said:  We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments. Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.

        "content": "Novo Nordisk shares hit a record high after the Danish company reported soaring sales of its obesity and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, pushing its market value past $500bn and cementing its position as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company. Runaway demand for the drugs, which are taken by celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, has left the company struggling to keep up with orders and scrambling to expand production sites. Novo Nordisk shares rose by 4% on Wednesday before settling to trade 1.2% higher, leaving its market value hovering near $500bn (¬£394bn). The obesity drug boom has turned the drugmaker into Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, ahead of France‚Äôs luxury goods group LVMH, with a market value of $422bn. Obesity drug sales jumped by 154% at constant exchange rates to 41.6bn Danish kroner (¬£4.8bn) last year, fuelled by demand for Wegovy, which brought in ¬£3.6bn. Sales of diabetes drugs such as Ozempic grew by 52%, and obesity and diabetes drug sales totalled nearly ¬£25bn. Overall sales rose by 36% to ¬£26.6bn, while profit before tax jumped by 52% to ¬£12bn. The company expects sales growth to slow to between 18% and 26% this year, and operating profit growth of 21% to 29%, as competition increases and supply constraints continue. The new generation of weight-loss drugs, which also include the US drugmaker Eli Lilly‚Äôs Mounjaro, sold as Zepbound, mimic the action of a gut hormone called GLP-1 by suppressing appetite and slowing the movement of food through the digestive system. They have helped many people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause side effects ranging from nausea, bloating, diarrhoea and fatigue to more serious stomach, kidney and gallbladder problems and inflammation of the pancreas. Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, the president and chief executive, said: ‚ÄúMore than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments. Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.‚Äù Blockbuster anti-obesity drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy also appear to dampen inflammation, raising hope that they could be used to treat diseases including Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs, which are characterised by brain inflammation, according to the journal Nature.As more patients start on the drugs, which they self-inject weekly, Karsten Munk Knudsen, the chief financial officer of Novo Nordisk, said prices for Wegovy and Ozempic would gradually come down to ease pressure on national healthcare systems and insurers. In the US, Wegovy‚Äôs list price for a month‚Äôs supply is $1,349 while Zepbound is at $1,060. In the UK, Wegovy‚Äôs list price for a high-dose pack with four pre-filled pens is ¬£175.80. Separately on Wednesday, the GSK chief executive, Emma Walmsley, said its new RSV vaccine was expected to bring in annual sales of at least ¬£3bn in future. Britain‚Äôs second-biggest drugmaker beat analysts‚Äô expectations with fourth-quarter profits and sales as the RSV vaccine became a blockbuster, racking up ¬£1.2bn sales in four months, on top of steady demand for its shingles shot and HIV medicines. RSV, a common respiratory virus, can lead to hospitalisation and death in older adults. In the first annual results since it spun off its consumer healthcare business Haleon in July 2022, GSK reported a pre-tax profit of ¬£6.1bn, up by 14% at constant exchange rates. Turnover rose by 5% to ¬£30.3bn.  The company has upgraded its outlook and now estimates it can achieve more than ¬£38bn in sales by 2031, up from ¬£33bn estimated in 2021. The RSV vaccine, Arexvy, was launched in the US last autumn. It was approved in the UK in July but is not yet available on the NHS. The shot can be bought privately at pharmacies and private clinics. Walmsley said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having very positive discussions with the government and we‚Äôre hoping to bring this to the UK public as soon as possible.‚Äù The GSK share price reversed earlier losses and rose 3.6% to ¬£15.93 on Wednesday, and has increased 15% in the past six months."

        "content": "Boeing faces a ‚Äúserious challenge‚Äù to win back the confidence of regulators and airlines, its CEO has said, as the aircraft maker faces intense scrutiny after a cabin panel blowout. Dave Calhoun acknowledged the business has ‚Äúmuch to prove‚Äù since a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet was forced into an emergency landing earlier this month.   Related: After the latest Max crisis, Boeing must focus on flight, not finance   The dramatic incident during an Alaska Airlines flight ‚Äì which prompted 171 Max 9 jets to be grounded for several weeks ‚Äì has sparked the biggest safety crisis for Boeing since the crashes of two of its Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. As it reported its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, Boeing declined to provide Wall Street with guidance for the year ahead, stating that its ‚Äúfull focus‚Äù was on working to ‚Äústrengthen quality‚Äù at the company. In a letter to employees, publicly released alongside the results, Calhoun described ‚Äútough and direct conversations‚Äù with airlines, regulators and politicians in recent weeks. ‚ÄúThey are disappointed and we have much to prove to earn our stakeholders‚Äô confidence,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThere is no message or slogan to do that.‚Äù Officials have expressed more than disappointment. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ramped up oversight of Boeing, and last week barred the company from increasing production on its Max manufacturing line. ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt be back to business as usual for Boeing,‚Äù warned Mike Whitaker, the agency‚Äôs administrator, who stressed it would not approve any production expansion ‚Äúuntil we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved‚Äù. Such scrutiny ‚Äúwill make us better‚Äù, Calhoun told staff. But it has also prompted anger from Boeing‚Äôs customers, and prompted some, such as United Airlines, to weigh plans to leave a forthcoming Boeing jet, the Max 10, out of its fleet. Boeing posted a 10% rise in revenue to $22.02bn in the fourth quarter, which finished days before the Alaska incident on 5 January. Its net losses narrowed from $663m to $30m over the same period. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken significant steps over the last several years to strengthen our safety and quality processes,‚Äù Calhoun wrote, ‚Äúbut this accident makes it absolutely clear that we have more work to do.‚Äù The CEO nevertheless insisted that Boeing‚Äôs management still has ‚Äúevery confidence‚Äù in the company‚Äôs recovery. ‚ÄúWe have a serious challenge in front of us ‚Äì but I know this team is up to the task.‚Äù"

        "content": "Labour will not reinstate a cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses if it wins the next election, the shadow chancellor has said.Rachel Reeves said she had ‚Äúno intention‚Äù of bringing back the cap, saying she wanted to be the ‚Äúchampion of a thriving financial services industry‚Äù.\nThe regulations, which limited annual bonus payouts to twice a banker‚Äôs salary, were introduced by the EU in 2014, in a move aimed at preventing excessive risk-taking after the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn 2022, the then chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced that he would be removing this rule as part of his now infamous mini-budget amid Liz Truss‚Äôs short tenure as prime minister.\nThe decision received widespread criticism for rewarding bankers and failing to address cost-of-living concerns affecting households across the UK.\nHowever, it was one of the few mini-budget policies to be kept under Rishi Sunak‚Äôs leadership, with the new rules coming into force in October last year.\nUnions claimed Sunak was fuelling a ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù culture in the City of London. The cap originally limited bonuses to two times bankers‚Äô salaries, giving the average City worker an opportunity to pocket as much as ¬£120,000 extra, equivalent to about seven times the average pay of a care worker, the Trades Union Congress said.\nMomentum, a grassroots organisation of the party‚Äôs leftwing, said: ‚ÄúThis is a terrible decision totally out of touch with Labour‚Äôs values and public opinion. For over 40 years our economic model has sucked wealth from the country and enriched a few in the City.\n‚ÄúIt even crashed the economy in 2008. Yet instead of learning the lessons from New Labour‚Äôs failures, Starmer and Reeves seem determined to repeat them.‚Äù\nLabour has previously criticised the Tories for removing the cap, saying it was ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù with the British public.\nDarren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said in October, after the lifting of the cap: ‚Äú‚ÄòAt a time when families are struggling with the cost of living and mortgages are rising, this decision tells you everything you need to know about the priorities of this out of touch Conservative government.‚Äù\nReeves told the BBC on Wednesday: ‚ÄúThe cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses was brought in in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances.‚ÄúBut that has gone now and we don‚Äôt have any intention of bringing that back. And as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.‚Äù\nLabour said on Tuesday that it planned to cut swathes of red tape in the financial services sector, while ‚Äúunashamedly championing‚Äù the industry.\nIn a 24-page document, seen by the Guardian, Labour has promised to cut down 10,000 pages of regulations and ruled out a windfall tax on bank profits.\nReeves defended the move, insisting it was not about watering down protection for consumers or the UK‚Äôs financial stability.\nLabour will formally announce its plans to harness the strengths of the financial sector to City bosses at its business conference in London on Thursday.\nTo counter the growing support across industry and the City for Labour‚Äôs pro-business stance, Sunak has recruited chief executives from some of the UK‚Äôs largest companies to advise him and ‚Äúhelp drive the government‚Äôs growth agenda‚Äù.\nThe prime minister said a number of bosses from a wide range of industries would attend a new business council, including the chief executives of BT, Nationwide, Unilever and Greggs.\nSunak said: ‚ÄúComing from a small business family, I know how integral business is to communities and the wider economy. Without the jobs, growth, and innovation created by UK firms, the country simply wouldn‚Äôt function.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting businesses in for a regular update on how well we are doing in delivering for business ‚Äì straight from the shop floor.‚Äù"

        "content": "Rail passengers in the north of England face major disruption on Wednesday as strikes by train drivers stop all Northern and TransPennine Express (TPE) services. The 24-hour strike is the second in a series of rolling stoppages over a week by members of Aslef, the drivers‚Äô union, in the long-running pay dispute. It follows strikes that wiped out the biggest national rail commuter services in southeast England on Tuesday. Passenger numbers on the tube were down 10% from last Tuesday with many rail commuters unable to reach the capital, according to figures from Transport for London. Both Northern and TPE have warned customers not to attempt to travel on Wednesday as no services will run, including on TPE‚Äôs routes into Scotland. An overtime ban that started on Monday across all the operators in England is also expected to bring more short-notice cancellations to services and potential disruption until next Tuesday. While the government hoped that its recently passed anti-strike laws would push train operators to enforce minimum service levels (MSLs) this week, none have attempted to deploy the powers. LNER, one of the four state-run operators, was faced with five additional days of strikes after tentatively starting the process, until it withdrew plans to enforce the strike-busting law. Unions have said that MSLs are unworkable. However, Downing Street piled on pressure this week by claiming that they were ‚Äúa key tool that train operators themselves have asked for to reduce the impact of disruption on passengers. They should now use them‚Äù. Train operators, however, told House of Commons hearings last year that they had no clarity over how they should be used. A senior rail industry source said it was not true that operators had lobbied for the anti-strike powers ‚Äì a Conservative manifesto pledge ‚Äì and instead had warned that they were likely to exacerbate industrial unrest. Further strikes will follow at LNER, Greater Anglia and C2C on Friday. No trains will run across West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast and East Midlands Railway during strikes on Saturday. The overtime ban‚Äôs impact is likely to peak on Sunday, reducing timetables at a number of operators which rely on voluntary rest day working. The last strikes will take place at Great Western, CrossCountry and Chiltern on Monday. The pay dispute affects train operators in England contracted to the Department for Transport (DfT), although the industrial action will also affect some cross-border services to Scotland and Wales. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, has advised passengers to check before they travel throughout the week. Aslef has warned it will continue strikes until there are further negotiations on a pay deal. It said some drivers were now approaching five years without a pay rise, after working through the pandemic. The RDG said Aslef should stop calling ‚Äúdamaging industrial action‚Äù and work with them to resolve the dispute and make ‚Äúthe changes needed to make services more reliable‚Äù. Huw Merriman, the rail minister, said: ‚ÄúPassengers are being targeted by Aslef‚Äôs decision to go on strike, despite union bosses having an offer on the table that would take train drivers‚Äô average salary up to ¬£65,000 for a four-day week. ‚ÄúWhile the RMT [National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers], TSSA [Transport Salaried Staffs‚Äô Association] and Unite have all agreed deals for their members, Aslef‚Äôs leadership isn‚Äôt even putting the fair offer on the table to a vote of their members.‚Äù"

        "content": "Australia‚Äôs inflation retreated to a two-year low in the December quarter as food and fuel prices increased at a slower pace, fanning hopes the next move by the Reserve Bank will be an interest rate cut.\nThe consumer price index came in at 4.1% in the final three months of 2023 compared with a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had expected CPI to come in at 4.3%, easing from the September quarter pace of 5.4%.\nFor the quarter alone, CPI rose 0.6%, or half the pace of the September quarter. Economists had tipped the quarterly rate would be 0.8%.\n\n Related: Dutton under pressure to back stage-three tax changes as analysis shows big benefit to Coalition electorates  \n\nFor December alone, CPI was 3.4%, also lower than the 3.7% pace predicted by economists.\n‚ÄúThe lower-than-expected December quarter consumer price index result should effectively kill off any lingering chance of an RBA rate hike next week,‚Äù said David Bassanese, the chief economist at BetaShares.\nThe treasurer, Jim Chalmers, welcomed the CPI figures. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing here is inflation is slowing, real wages [are] growing, and from the first of July we will see tax cuts flowing,‚Äù he said.\n‚ÄúThis is not mission accomplished, but it‚Äôs really welcomed and it‚Äôs really encouraging progress.‚Äù\nAmong the key movers, food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 0.5% in the quarter, with lamb prices falling 12.1% and beef and veal 1.5% as farmers destocked. Automotive fuel prices were also down 0.2% for the quarter even with the eruption of the war in Gaza after the 7 October attacks against Israel.\n Interactive\n\nInsurance costs, though, rose 3.8% in the quarter, quickening from September‚Äôs 2.8% pace. The 16.2% increase from a year earlier was the most since the March quarter of 2001, the ABS said.\nThe RBA had forecast in November that inflation would end 2023 at an annual rate of 4.5%. Prior to today‚Äôs CPI figures, investors saw minimal chance the central bank would lift its cash rate from 4.35% when its board meets for the first time this year next Monday and Tuesday.\nAttention is instead focusing on how soon the RBA will start cutting interest rates if it becomes confident inflation will drop back within its 2-3% target range before the end of next year. The trimmed mean measure of inflation that strips out more volatile movers was up 4.2% in the quarter from a year earlier.\nRetail sales figures for December out on Tuesday showed turnover was just 0.8% higher than a year earlier, implying spending sank once inflation was deducted and underscoring weakness in the economy. Excluding the Covid lockdown periods, retail growth was the weakest since July 2000, the Commonwealth Bank said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dollar fell about 0.2 US cents to 65.8 US cents and the Australian share market added about 0.25% as investors trimmed their bets for any more interest rate rises, with the ASX200 share index later rising to a record high.\nThe EY chief economist, Cherelle Murphy, said the inflation data showed the RBA‚Äôs 13 rate rises since May 2022 had worked and there was ‚Äúno reason to lift the cash rate next week‚Äù.\nHowever, mortgage holders will likely have to remain patient about early rate cuts. ‚ÄúDomestic sources of inflationary pressures are still present ‚Äì including continued strong demand for housing, rising insurance premiums and a tight labour market,‚Äù Murphy said.\n‚ÄúInternational sources, including conflict in the Middle East and global shipping issues, could also be a source of upward pressure on energy and transport prices as the year rolls on,‚Äù she said.\nHousing costs were up 1%, while rents rose 0.9% for the quarter, a reduction from the 2.2% pace in the September quarter. Rents were still rising at a 7.3% rate at the end of 2023 compared to a year earlier, marginally less than the 7.6% pace in the September quarter.\nFurnishings and other household equipment fell the most of any category, dropping 1% in the quarter.\nNon-discretionary goods and services were up 4.8% from a year earlier for the December quarter, and up 0.6% in the quarter itself. With wage increases likely to be running at about a 4% clip at the end of 2023, many households would still be getting squeezed in real terms.\nBy contrast, discretionary goods and services rose at a 3% pace in the December quarter compared to a year earlier.\nThere was also quite a wide difference between tradeable goods and services and non-tradeable ones. With Covid disruptions all but over and with China battling falling prices, tradeables were 1.5% more expensive than a year earlier ‚Äì the slowest increase in almost three years. Non-tradeables, though, were up 5.4%.\nPower prices in the December quarter were up 1.4%, or a third of the pace of increases in the September quarter, the ABS said.\nElectricity prices were up 6.9% from a year earlier ‚Äì less than the half the increase we saw in the September quarter. The timing of the government‚Äôs energy bill rebates made a difference. Since the June quarter, power prices are up 5.7% but without the rebates the increase would have showed up as a 17.6% hike, the ABS said.\nThere is increasing expectation that electricity prices will be lower after 1 July given the fall in wholesale prices in 2023, as reported last week.\nAcross the cities that the ABS surveys, Hobart posted the slowest annual increase at 3.3%, with Adelaide‚Äôs 4.8% increase the highest."

        "published_date": "2024-01-31T00:01:09+00:00",
        "content": "Today will bring the first stage in new, wide-ranging Brexit border controls on the import of plants, animals and food to the UK from the European Union. The changes, the most significant for importers since the UK left the single market three years ago, are poised to have huge ramifications for businesses that rely on imports from the continent. So what exactly are the changes, and will they push up the prices we pay for food and plants? What are the new border controls? At midnight on Tuesday, the government triggered the first stage of a rolling programme of tighter controls on goods entering the UK from the EU. The new system, christened the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), classifies all plant and animal products coming from the EU and puts them into three risk groups: high, medium and low. Medium- and high-risk plant and meat products will now require health certificates before they can enter the UK. High-risk products include plants for planting, some seeds, tubers and live animals. The medium-risk category covers cut flowers and other parts of plants such as tomato plant cuttings, as well as meat, non-pasteurised milk, eggs and some fish. From today, anyone exporting meat and dairy products to the UK will need to find a vet in the country of origin to fill out a seven-page form giving assurances that the product is disease-free. For plant products the same assurances will be needed but from a plant health inspector. Low-risk products, which include some fruit and vegetables such as cucumber and asparagus, processed meats, and cheese made from pasteurised milk, will be exempt from extensive documentation. What are the next stages? The most significant change will come on 30 April, when the government begins physical checks at the border on medium-risk and high-risk goods coming into the country. These checks will take place at specially designated border control posts. Many of these control posts are extensions of existing facilities, which check plant and animal goods coming in from non-EU countries. However, some have been established specifically for these changes. This includes a new ¬£147m facility at Sevington, near Dover, which will process all the products coming through the UK‚Äôs busiest port. The final major change will come in October, with the government requiring safety and security declarations for medium- and high-risk imports, while also introducing a single trade window, which the government says will reduce the number of forms needed for importers. As of yet, goods coming from the island of Ireland will not require physical checks but the government has said these will be introduced at some point after 31 October this year. Will the new border controls push up prices? The government has acknowledged that the extra checks are likely to add to costs for businesses and the consumer. It has calculated a cost of about ¬£330m a year, and reckons this would push up retail food prices by 0.2% over three years. However, this may be an underestimate. This is because the government intends in October to add many more fruit and vegetable products, such as strawberries, apples, sweet potatoes and carrots, to the medium-risk category, meaning additional checks and certification. The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates this will add a further ¬£200m a year to the cost of importing fruit and vegetables from the EU. There are also concerns that the changes could result in less consumer choice. The Guild of Fine Food, which represents independent food and drink retailers, said smaller suppliers of certain products across the continent were likely to stop exporting to the UK because of the extra red tape. Why are these changes being made? First, there is a legal requirement. World Trade Organization rules state that trade borders for the EU must match those of the rest of the world, so as not to give the bloc a trading advantage. The controls, which have been delayed five times over fears that they could cause disruption and further fuel price inflation, also now mirror those that UK exporters have faced since January 2021. Meat and dairy farmers, who faced red tape when exporting to the EU while competitors from Europe had unfettered access to UK markets, have welcomed the changes. The other major reason for imposing controls on incoming goods is biosecurity. The new checks will be important for ensuring that plant and animal diseases, such as xylella, a fast-spreading bacterial disease for plants found in mainland Europe, or African swine fever, which affects pigs, are not imported."

        "published_date": "2024-01-30T22:59:03+00:00",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund has issued a strong warning to Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes in his budget in March, stressing the need to boost key areas of public spending instead. In updated forecasts for the UK and the rest of the global economy, the Washington-based fund doubted whether the widely anticipated tax cuts would be possible without extra borrowing or post-election spending cuts. The IMF said the chancellor should be focusing on repairing the public finances after the damage caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine in order to meet growing spending pressures.   Related: IMF warns Hunt against tax cuts; eurozone avoids recession ‚Äì business live   An IMF spokesperson said: ‚ÄúPreserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government‚Äôs budget plans. ‚ÄúAccommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.‚Äù Hunt is expected to cut income tax in the budget, but the IMF called on the chancellor to increase carbon and property taxes, take steps to eliminate loopholes in the taxation of wealth and income, and overhaul the pensions triple lock. ‚ÄúIt is in this context that [IMF] staff advises against further tax cuts,‚Äù the IMF said. Hunt rejected the IMF‚Äôs call. ‚ÄúThe IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside national insurance cuts to improve work incentives,‚Äù the chancellor said. ‚ÄúIt is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.‚Äù However, it has been reported the Hunt warned the cabinet that ‚Äúmajor structural weaknesses‚Äù in the economy meant tax cuts would be smaller than in the autumn statement, when he reduced national insurance contributions by two percentage points. ‚ÄúWe are not likely to have as much room for tax cuts as we had in the autumn,‚Äù Hunt told a cabinet meeting, according to the Times. The IMF said it was forecasting UK growth of 0.5% in 2023 and 0.6% in 2024 ‚Äì both unchanged from October ‚Äì and with only Germany of the leading G7 industrialised economies expanding more weakly. With lower inflation likely to boost consumer spending power, the IMF said it was pencilling in UK growth of 1.6% in 2025 ‚Äì slower than forecast three months ago. ‚ÄúThe markdown to growth in 2025 of 0.4 percentage points reflects reduced scope for growth to catch up in light of recent upward statistical revisions to the level of output through the pandemic period,‚Äù the IMF said. Last year, the Office for National Statistics revised up its estimates of UK growth in 2020 and 2021 by 1.8 points in total across the two years. The IMF said the global economy was gliding towards a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù after coping with the impact of tough central bank interest-rate action to reduce inflation. Revising up its growth estimates for 2024, the IMF said a number of big economies ‚Äì including the US, China, Russia and India ‚Äì had posted stronger than expected performances in 2023 and it was surprised by the resilience shown. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF‚Äôs economic counsellor said: ‚ÄúThe clouds are beginning to part. The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up.‚Äù Announcing details of the interim World Economic Outlook (WEO), Gourinchas said the IMF expected global growth to be 3.1% in 2023 and 2024, upward revisions of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But he stressed the pace of expansion ‚Äì which compares with an average of 3.8% during the 2010s ‚Äì remained slow and there was a risk of turbulence ahead. The IMF said the likelihood of a hard landing had receded and risks to its forecasts were evenly balanced. Growth could be higher than expected if tumbling inflation allowed deeper cuts in interest rates, if governments facing elections boosted public spending or if artificial intelligence increased productivity. However, the IMF warned of downside risks including the volatile situation in the Middle East; the possibility that inflation would prove stubborn and signs that investors were excessively optimistic about the scale of interest rate cuts from central banks this year.   Related: The global economy is poised for another tumultuous year in 2024 | Kenneth Rogoff   Gourinchas said he had been particularly surprised by the rapid improvement in the supply side of the global economy, singling out higher labour force participation rates, the easing of supply chain bottlenecks and lower commodity and energy prices.  He warned that central banks ‚Äúmust avoid premature easing that would undo many hard-earned credibility gains and lead to a rebound in inflation‚Äù. However, Gourinchas added: ‚ÄúSigns of strain are growing in interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as construction, and loan activity has declined markedly. ‚ÄúIt will be equally important to pivot toward monetary normalisation in time, as several emerging markets where inflation is well on the way down have started doing already. Not doing so would jeopardise growth and risk inflation falling below target. ‚ÄúMy sense is that the US, where inflation appears more demand-driven, needs to focus on risks in the first category, while the euro area, where the surge in energy prices has played a disproportionate role, needs to manage more the second risk. In both cases, staying on the path toward a soft landing may not be easy.‚Äù The IMF produces two full versions of the WEO each year, in April and October, then updates its forecasts in January and July. The latest interim WEO revised up US growth for 2023 from 2.1% to 2.5%, China from 5% to 5.2%, India from 6.3% to 6.7% and Russia from 2.2% to 3%. The eurozone, in contrast, performed less strongly in 2023 than previously forecast and its growth has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points to 0.5%."

        "content": "Labour has pledged to ‚Äúunashamedly champion‚Äù the UK‚Äôs financial services sector, as it promised to cut down 10,000 pages of regulations and ruled out a windfall tax on bank profits. However, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, signalled that Labour would not bow to intensive lobbying from the private equity industry, telling the Guardian she still planned to close a ¬£500m tax loophole benefiting Britain‚Äôs private equity executives. In a 24-page document seen by the Guardian, Labour said it would aim to harness the strengths of the financial sector, which it claimed the Conservative party had taken for granted.   Related: Green economy must be next UK government‚Äôs No 1 priority ‚Äì Lane Fox   ‚ÄúBritain‚Äôs financial services lead the world ‚Ä¶ But too often that success has been in spite, not because, of the actions of the government, which has lacked commitment to its success and stoked instability,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúWe will unashamedly champion our financial services sector as one of the UK‚Äôs greatest assets,‚Äù Reeves added. Labour, which will formally unveil the plans to City bosses at its business conference in London on Thursday, said the move would involve cutting the industry‚Äôs ‚Äúregulatory burden‚Äù including by streamlining some ‚Äúexcessively procedural rules‚Äù in the Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs (FCA‚Äôs) 10,000-page regulatory handbook. It will also find and scrap overlapping rules set by the FCA, the Bank of England and the Competition and Markets Authority, and create a ‚ÄúRegulatory Innovation Office‚Äù that could help regulators share data, and will monitor the watchdog‚Äôs work. Reeves defended the move to cut down on City rules, saying it was not about watering down protection for consumers or the UK‚Äôs financial stability. ‚ÄúIt is important to have a proper review to make sure that the rules and regulations that we‚Äôve got are fit for purpose and don‚Äôt cut across each other. So it‚Äôs about having smart and sensible regulation that works for consumers, and also works for the sector.‚Äù Labour‚Äôs charm offensive comes as the City faces growing threats from rival financial hubs including New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, particularly post-Brexit. London‚Äôs stock market has seen an exodus of companies, with Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, saying this week it was considering moving its primary listing to New York ‚Äúas soon as practicable‚Äù. The UK‚Äôs ¬£275bn financial and professional services sector accounts for about 12% of the economy and is a huge tax generator. While the report, titled Financing Growth, is silent on Labour‚Äôs tax plans for the sector, Reeves said confirmed that banking executives could rest easy. ‚ÄúWe have no plans for a windfall tax,‚Äù Reeves said.  Some bankers have been concerned that Labour could end up following in Italy‚Äôs footsteps and launching a tax raid on profits, which have been bolstered by rising interest rates. Banks were criticised last year for raising rates on mortgages and loans more quickly than those offered to savers. Reeves also said she was not backing down on her plan to scrap a discounted tax rates for ‚Äúcarried interest‚Äù in the private equity industry, referring to the share of profits that fund managers make on successful deals. Dealmakers pay 28% capital gains tax on those profits, much lower than the 45% income tax levied on higher earners. ‚ÄúThat is one of the three tax-raising policies that we have announced along with closing the non-dom tax loophole and applying VAT and business rates on private schools,‚Äù the shadow chancellor said. The report takes a swipe at the Tories‚Äô record on supporting the financial sector post-Brexit and says a Labour government would work with the EU to remove ‚Äúunnecessary barriers‚Äù for firms. In an attempt to revive the UK‚Äôs flagging stock market, Labour said it would launch a campaign to encourage consumers to buy up the shares of British companies and encourage pension schemes to push more cash into small private companies, venture capital and infrastructure investments. For consumers, the party said it would focus on forging on national financial inclusion strategy, to support vulnerable households. That would involve quickly rolling out regulation of controversial buy now, pay later products, and giving regulators power to guarantee face-to-face banking for branchless communities across the UK. Labour also said it would partner with City firms to make the UK a ‚Äúglobal hub for green finance‚Äù, and ramp up the decarbonisation of the country‚Äôs housing stock, by expanding green mortgages and partnering with City firms to create loan products that can better fund retrofitting. It would also force City firms and the UK‚Äôs largest listed companies on the FTSE 100 to publicly declare their carbon footprint and adopt ‚Äúcredible‚Äù climate transition plans. The shadow Treasury team said it aimed to spread the wealth, with plans to expand the financial services into regional hubs, beyond London and Edinburgh, and it would establish a ‚ÄúSkills England‚Äù body to seek out and foster talent in those areas. ‚ÄúNone of the ambitions of the next Labour government can be achieved without a strong financial sector playing its part in reviving investment,‚Äù Labour said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time we took pride in what Britain does best.‚Äù"

        "content": "Sky is to cut about 1,000 jobs as customers move away from traditional satellite pay-TV to streaming-based services, in the latest round of redundancies to hit the UK media industry. The company, which employs about 26,000 staff in the UK, is seeking to reduce its workforce by about 4% this year. The cuts will come mainly from its army of workers that install equipment in households, with the number employed expected to be reduced by about a quarter, as more consumers make the shift to plug-and-go internet-based products such as Sky Stream and the Sky Glass smart TV. Sky estimates that about three-quarters of new products being taken are internet-based, reducing the need for installers. Sky‚Äôs move comes days after Channel 4 confirmed that it is to reduce its headcount by 240, the biggest round of cuts since 2008, in response to the slump in the TV ad market, which has prompted an acceleration of its plans to become a digital-first broadcaster. While Sky is not as dependent on advertising as broadcasters such as Channel 4 and ITV, which is also widely expected to unveil a job cuts programme in the coming weeks, the company has also been affected by the downturn. In 2018, the US media giant Comcast acquired Sky, which includes its operations in Germany and Italy, for ¬£32bn. However, two years ago Comcast recorded an $8.6bn write-down on the Sky business over growing concern over the economic outlook as the cost of living crisis began to impact consumer spending. In the final quarter last year, Sky reported a 13% decline in revenues to $4.42bn (¬£3.48bn), although this decline was significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. ‚ÄúThe launch of Sky Glass and Sky Stream represents a shift in our business to deliver TV over IP [an internet connection] rather than satellite,‚Äù said a Sky spokesman. ‚ÄúIncreasingly, customers are choosing Sky Glass and Sky Stream which don‚Äôt require specialist installation, and that has led us to change the number of roles we need to deliver our services.‚Äù Sky is not the only media and telecoms business seeking to reduce staff in its traditional business. Last year, BT said it intends to reduce its workforce by as much as 55,000 by 2030, more than 40% of its global employee base, in large part due to the completion of the roll out of full-fibre broadband and 5G networks. And Vodafone is in the process of cutting 11,000 jobs from its global workforce by the end of 2025, more than 10% of its 104,000 global staff, the largest round of cuts in the troubled telecoms group‚Äôs history. The company employs about 9,000 people in the UK, including at its headquarters in Berkshire. However, Sky, which is now part of a wider group that includes film studio Universal, is still recruiting in growing parts of its business. In 2021, the company says it intends to create 2,000 new jobs at its new studio complex at Elstree."

        "content": "Britain‚Äôs next government should make the transition to a green economy its No 1 priority to reboot economic growth and avoid falling behind rival nations, the head one of the country‚Äôs most powerful business groups has said. Urging the Conservatives and Labour not to backtrack on environmental promises to score points in the general election campaign, Martha Lane Fox, the entrepreneur and British Chambers of Commerce president, said there was a danger of politicians creating a ‚Äúsignificant brake on progress‚Äù by politicising climate goals. ‚ÄúThis is beyond your electability,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is the fundamental plank to build a robust economy. [And] the climate is too important to denigrate in the list of political priorities.‚Äù Speaking in an interview to mark a major report setting out business leaders‚Äô priorities for the green transition, to be launched in Glasgow on Wednesday, Lane Fox said company bosses wanted clearer and more consistent policymaking from the government. It comes after Rishi Sunak scaled back the government‚Äôs net zero policies last autumn, drawing fierce criticism from business leaders, while Keir Starmer is under pressure to ditch a promise to invest ¬£28bn in green industry. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always going to be that level of political noise, especially in an election year. I personally wish it wasn‚Äôt thus, but I hope the serious politicians and serious policies are still clear for business,‚Äù Lane Fox said. ‚ÄúNone of us will have a business life, none of us will have an economy, if we don‚Äôt put the planet at the heart of how we think about the next decades. It‚Äôs a bit existential. And at a more capitalist level, if you like, I really do believe that the world‚Äôs first trillionaire will come from green-related business.‚Äù In the first report produced by the BCC‚Äôs business council ‚Äì launched last year after turmoil at the Confederation of British Industry ‚Äì it called on the next government to implement a green industrial strategy to cement the UK‚Äôs status as a global leader in low-carbon enterprise. It also suggested the creation of a permanent cross-government body that takes a strategic approach to delivering green skills and jobs growth in the UK, inspired by the success of the Covid vaccine taskforce. The report from the BCC is the first in a series on five key challenges for the UK economy identified by its business council ‚Äì which counts companies including BP, Drax, Heathrow and IHG Hotels & Resorts as members ‚Äì alongside ‚Äúdigital revolution‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople and work‚Äù, ‚Äúglobal Britain‚Äù and the ‚Äúhigh street‚Äù. Lane Fox said a new body to coordinate the green transition could give business more confidence to invest in Britain, ‚Äúmaking sure that stuff happens and that you can‚Äôt be subject to the vagaries of the political cycle‚Äù after Sunak used a speech last autumn to push back decarbonisation deadlines. The prime minister drew widespread criticism from business after rolling back a 2030 deadline for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by five years, while easing a ban on the sale of gas boilers from 2035. Lane Fox said more certainty would help after a period of ‚Äúchop and change‚Äù in government, with three prime ministers in as many years. ‚ÄúWe have had relatively more stability in the past year which I think has been helpful, but there‚Äôs a long way to go. It‚Äôs going to be a very noisy political year,‚Äù she said. Asked whether Labour should keep a promise to increase investment in green industries by ¬£28bn a year by the end of the next parliament, Lane Fox said business leaders were looking for a ‚Äúsignificant commitment‚Äù from government to support decarbonisation. ‚ÄúHelping unlock and having as much significant investment into this agenda would be fundamental for the future resilience of our economy and our businesses. So I don‚Äôt know if ¬£28bn is exactly the right number. I just hope that whatever the number, that the party continues to put the green transition at the heart of how it thinks about its policies,‚Äù she added."

Moreover, fiscal policy will be restrictive as well, with energy-support measures for households and companies being unwound. On the other hand, the combination of a drop in inflation and still elevated wage growth will support household income.\n Besides, the upcoming start of interest rate cuts by the main central banks has resulted in some easing of financial conditions and has also lifted consumer and producer confidence, which should support domestic spending. No sharp rebound in growth is expected, however, and we do not expect growth to gain momentum and rise above the trend growth rate until around the end of the year\n\n\n\n\n 12.18pm GMT \n\nAway from the eurozone, Mexico‚Äôs economy only managed modest growth at the end of 2023.\nGovernment statistics show that Mexico‚Äôs economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter, weaker than the 0.4% growth expected by economists.\n\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Mexico expanded 0.10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 over the previous quarter.https://t.co/jZz1k45nzz pic.twitter.com/EAsnRGLyWO‚Äî TRADING ECONOMICS (@tEconomics) January 30, 2024\n\n\nOn an annual basis, Mexico grew by 2.4%, below the 3.1% expected.\n\n\n\n 12.16pm GMT \n\nToday‚Äôs GDP report shows that Ireland‚Äôs GDP contracted in each of the four quarters of 2023, shrinking by 1.9% in Q1, 0.4% in Q2, 1,9% again in Q3 and then 0.7% in Q4.\n\n\nüìäEuropean Countries 2023 Q4 GDP QoQIreland üáÆüá™: -0.7Germany üá©üá™: -0.3Lithuania üá±üáπ: -0.3Euro area üá™üá∫: 0EU üá™üá∫: 0France üá´üá∑: 0Sweden üá∏üá™: 0.1Czechia üá®üáø: 0.2Italy üáÆüáπ: 0.2Austria üá¶üáπ: 0.2Belgium üáßüá™: 0.4Latvia üá±üáª: 0.4Spain üá™üá∏: 0.6Portugal üáµüáπ: 0.8#MM pic.twitter.com/3Dwu1CkbC2‚Äî MacroMicro (@MacroMicroMe) January 30, 2024\n\n\nIreland‚Äôs Central Statistics Office says this is due to a decrease in the ‚Äúmultinational dominated sectors of Industry‚Äù ‚Äì ie large international corporations who base themselves in Ireland, partly for tax reasons.\n\n\n\n 12.11pm GMT \n\n\n\nüá™üá∫ The Euro Area is clearly stagnating, and quite possibly will not be able to start growing without rate cuts by the ECB‚û°Ô∏è QoQ: 0% real GDP growth, with contractions in Ireland, Germany, Lithuania and a stagnation in France‚û°Ô∏è YoY vs Q4-22: 0.1% real growth, with contractions‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ybEFqkS5oZ‚Äî Nikolay Kolarov, CFA (@libertniko) January 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.13am GMT \n\n\n\nIreland dragged substantially on eurozone GDP growth, the eurozone would have grown by about 0.06% excluding Ireland in 4Q. pic.twitter.com/8kP2MLWns2‚Äî Bert Colijn (@BertColijn) January 30, 2024\n\n\nIreland‚Äôs GDP readings can be volatile due to the large multinationals based in the Republic, and isn‚Äôt really a good tracker of its econony.\n\nUpdated at 11.13am GMT\n\n\n 11.11am GMT \n\nThe eurozone‚Äôs refusal to fall into recession (yet, anyway) takes some pressure off the Euroepan Central Bank as it assesses when would be safe to start cutting interest rates.\nAlex Livingstone, head of FX and trading at Titan Asset Management, says:\n\n‚ÄúThe Q4 2023 growth numbers for the Euro Area revealed stagnant 0% growth, surpassing the -0.1% consensus for the quarter.\nBecause growth isn‚Äôt crumbling under the pressure of higher rates like some thought it might, this latest data print will buy [Christine] Lagarde some more time for inflation to return to the ECB‚Äôs 2% target before cutting rates.\n\n\n\n\n 10.50am GMT \nKey event\n\nIt‚Äôs not all doom and gloom for the eurozone, insists Michael Field, European market strategist at Morningstar:\nField points out that growth among Europe‚Äôs peripheral countries helped the eurozone avoid a recession, while the Big Two members struggled.\nHere‚Äôs his take on this morning‚Äôs GDP data: \n\n‚ÄúEuro area GDP was flat in the last quarter of 2023, coming in better than expectations of a 0.1% fall. This means that for the entire year, growth in the euro area economy was essentially steady. There are two ways to look at this. On the negative side, 2023 was effectively a dead year with zero growth, but on the positive side, despite record high interest rates and high inflation levels not seen since the 1970‚Äôs, the euro area economy successfully managed to avoid a recession.\n ‚ÄúA rebound in the peripheral economies of Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, registered the highest level of growth at 0.8% in the fourth quarter. While not blistering, this growth helped mitigate depressed growth in Europe‚Äôs two powerhouse economies of Germany and France.\n‚ÄúLack of growth in the euro area contrasts uncomfortably with the over 3% growth in the US over the same period. The negative implication of this is that it makes regional investment decisions for international firms all that much easier to make, with Europe looking much less attractive at this point in time. This situation is reflected in economic sentiment readings released today, which declined month on month.\n‚ÄúHowever, it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom in Europe. Inflation is within touching distance of central banks‚Äô targeted levels, meaning interest rates should decline over the course of this and next year. This brings much welcome relief to businesses and indeed consumers‚Äô pockets.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n 10.47am GMT \n\nToday‚Äôs data shows that the eurozone fell further behind the United States at the end of last year.\nData last week showed that US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.3% in Q4, which means a quarter-on-quarter increase of around 0.8%.

This growth has been primarily driven by smaller businesses having difficulty paying back government COVID support leading to an uptick in the number of Creditor‚Äôs Voluntary Liquidations. \n‚ÄúHowever, as we head further into 2024, we are likely to see more large-scale administrations compared to 2022 and 2023, as the impact of high interest rates begins to bite even further. This year is likely to be the busiest 12 months for insolvencies since 1993 as similar challenging conditions to 2023 will prevail ‚Äî ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, falling house prices, still low levels of consumer confidence ‚Äî combined with the lack of availability of interest payment holidays.

        "content": "Saudi Arabia has cast doubt on the future of the global oil market after abandoning plans to grow its crude production capacity by 1m barrels a day. The world‚Äôs biggest exporter signalled a big change in policy by ordering the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, to drop plans to expand its maximum production capacity to 13m barrels a day by 2027. The decision has raised questions over the future of global oil demand growth, weeks after an influential report found that a worldwide peak in crude demand could come before the end of this decade.   Related: BP under pressure from hedge fund to ditch clean energy strategy   The International Energy Agency said that the faltering global economy would slow the world‚Äôs growing demand for oil from this year, before the take-up of electric vehicles in the second half of the decade causes consumption to reach a peak. Riyadh‚Äôs order to drop Aramco‚Äôs expansion plans is expected to ‚Äúcause reverberations across the energy complex‚Äù, and has already ‚Äútriggered much speculation on the potential implications on global oil demand over the medium and long term‚Äù, according to Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital. The move may also help to support the flagging oil markets in a blow for the US president, Joe Biden, who would benefit from weaker pump prices ahead of the election later this year. The benchmark oil price is about $81 a barrel, narrowly below the average price during 2023, despite the conflict between Israel and Gaza that erupted in October and a significant escalation in attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. In response, Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) have agreed to hold back more than 1m barrels of oil production a day to help prop up prices. Saudi Arabia produced about 9m barrels of oil a day last year, enough to meet almost 10% of the world‚Äôs demand, but it has the capacity to produce up to 12m. In the past, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has claimed that the kingdom could increase its capacity to 20m barrels a day. The decision to scrap plans to expand its capacity could ‚Äúsuggest that Opec+ is beginning to recognise it has a problem‚Äù, according to analysts at Citi. They added that it represented ‚Äúa huge rethink of strategy and will have wide ramifications to Aramco capital spending, the Gulf supply chain and of course Opec+ oil policy‚Äù. The crown prince called for the multibillion-dollar expansion plan in 2020 in a show of strength as the global oil market began to falter in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic."

        "content": "The green-and-yellow Minis, sharp suits and skiing trips for the top 100 performers are back at Foxtons. Chief executive Guy Gittins started his career at the listed estate agency chain in 2002, and his efforts to rebuild the firm‚Äôs database, hire more staff, bring back face-to-face training, offer more incentives and double down on the lettings business seem to be paying off. He says Foxtons has the largest database in London, with 5.5 million contacts (landlords, tenants, vendors and buyers) and a timeline for every property the firm has ever dealt with. It will use AI tools to predict customer behaviour. Founded in 1981, Foxtons quickly became a leading player in London, known for its F-emblazoned cars and aggressive sales tactics. It went through rocky times, with branch closures, job cuts and plunging revenues under Gittins‚Äôs predecessor Nic Budden. But last October, a year after Gittins took the helm, the company declared it had got its ‚Äúmojo‚Äù back and reestablished its position as London‚Äôs No 1 estate agency brand, based on market share and growth of new instructions. But for some in the capital, it is a brand synonymous with the worst excesses of London‚Äôs property crunch: ever more unaffordable housing and pushy estate agents hungry for commission at all costs. Lettings now make up 70% of group revenues and offer stable income, unlike property sales, which are tied to the economic cycle. Lettings grew by 16% last year, delivering more than ¬£100m revenue for the first time, while sales revenues slid by 14%. Rents, which have soared in recent years, were expected to stabilise and remain at historically elevated levels, Foxtons said last week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not healthy for anybody,‚Äù says Gittins. ‚ÄúAnd we absolutely do not welcome 20% rent increases in a year. It‚Äôs not good for London, it‚Äôs terrible for tenants. The reality is it is a supply and demand imbalance that‚Äôs causing that issue.‚Äù A year ago, Foxtons wrote to the government asking it to act to encourage landlords back into the sector, after a removal of tax relief on mortgage interest and other measures. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not seeing a mass exodus of landlords ‚Äì that‚Äôs definitely not happening,‚Äù Gittins says. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not seeing the same volume of new landlords entering the market.‚Äù He sees ‚Äúsome green shoots‚Äù for tenants, saying there are 30% more rental properties on the market across all agencies than at this point last year. Unlike some rivals which are predicting further hefty rises in rents (Savills has forecast 6% increases), Gittins estimates it will be between 0 and 2%. When he was growing up, Gittins says, he was ‚Äúobsessed with engines and taking things apart, trying to find a way to improve them or make them go faster ‚Äì when I was in my early teens, I just wanted to be a race engineer‚Äù. So he studied engineering at Oxford Brookes University and spent a year with the Mitsubishi World Rally team, where he met businesspeople and wondered: ‚ÄúHow did they become so¬†successful?‚Äù That led him to his first job, at Foxtons‚Äôs largest branch in South Kensington. He was still living with his parents at the time and had borrowed a suit, tie and shoes for the interview; when he was told he could start the following Monday, he went shopping with his mum to buy his own outfits. He recalls: ‚ÄúFoxtons, particularly in the early 00s, was known as the cult because we worked and played together.‚Äù He soon became the top salesperson, because he got a flat near the office with a parking permit, which meant he could ‚Äúget an extra hour‚Äôs sleep‚Äù and ‚Äúdo an extra viewing each day across the entire week‚Äù while others were commuting from outside London. After meeting the property, oil and shipping magnate Peter de Savary through Foxtons, Gittins worked for him abroad on a number of island projects, including a marina and resort village in Grenada in the Caribbean. Four years later, he returned to the UK to launch the luxury apartment block One Hyde Park for the Candy brothers, who racked up more than ¬£2bn in sales from 86 flats. A 10-year stint at Chestertons ‚Äì one of the UK‚Äôs oldest estate agents, founded in 1805 ‚Äì followed, where he rose through the ranks from sales director to chief executive and turned the loss-making chain¬†around. Gittins was brought in by Foxtons‚Äôs new chairman, Nigel Rich, after the company came under mounting pressure for a change in leadership from large shareholders including Hosking Partners and Converium Capital. Activist investor Catalist claimed Foxtons had ‚Äúlost its way‚Äù. Those investors say that Gittins is doing a good job but complain that the company‚Äôs share price, while improved, is not reflecting the progress made. Some investors are urging Foxtons to put itself up for sale, pointing to other private equity-backed deals in the sector. (Foxtons has been in private equity ownership before, when founder Jon Hunt sold it to BC Partners in 2007.) The shares, which floated at 267p in 2013 and reached a peak of 399p in 2014, are changing hands for about 54.9p. But they have risen more than 40% in the last three months. Django Davidson, portfolio ¬≠manager at 10% shareholder Hosking Partners, says: ‚ÄúA sale is one way to close this valuation gap ‚Äì a fact that we‚Äôre sure is not lost on the current board.‚Äù Cory Bailey, co-founder of 3G Capital, which also owns 10% of Foxtons, agrees: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be hard for Foxtons to become a significant part of the consolidation in the sector unless they‚Äôre part of a private equity firm.‚Äù He says Foxtons‚Äôs lettings book of 30,000 properties in London is a ‚Äúprime asset‚Äù. Chestertons was recently sold to European real estate services group Emeria, owned by the Swiss private equity firm Partners Group, for a reported ¬£100m. Gittins dodges the buyout question. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre 100% focused on delivering the strategy that we set out, which is to deliver ¬£25m to ¬£30m of adjusted operating profit within the next three years,‚Äù compared with ¬£14m last year, he says.

        "content": "Buying bigger packs of products including toilet roll, cheese, laundry detergent pods or discounted ketchup may not always mean shoppers get a better deal, according to a competition watchdog investigation of grocery prices. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had examined a basket of 26 items and found examples when shoppers had not got a better deal by relying on ‚Äúrule of thumb‚Äù assumptions about what is best value in the first phase of an inquiry launched a year ago. ‚ÄúWhile it was usual for bigger packs to have a lower unit price than smaller packs, this wasn‚Äôt always true. We saw examples in our basket of groceries of larger packs having higher unit prices,‚Äù the CMA said in its first release of analysis from its investigation.   Related: Mr Kipling maker to cut more prices after bumper festive sales   It found that while products on promotion were generally cheaper than those not, there were examples where discounted items ‚Äúhad an equal or more expensive unit price than alternative pack sizes which were not on promotion‚Äù including ketchup and laundry detergent packs. It also found examples where items in multipacks, including mayonnaise, were more expensive for each unit than other packs that were not on promotion. ‚ÄúOur pricing analysis highlights the value of unit pricing when comparing between grocery items ‚Äì revealing that shoppers‚Äô commonly held assumptions about what products are cheapest on a per unit basis aren‚Äôt always right and that the pricing of some products relative to others can be surprising,‚Äù the CMA said. The watchdog has called on supermarkets to make their prices clearer ‚Äì laying out how much an item is per unit, such as per litre or kilogram, in a more consistent and legible way so that shoppers can know for sure if they are getting a better deal. The government has said it will introduce new rules for clearer labelling on supermarket shelves ‚Äì via an update to the price marking order ‚Äì but the CMA said the legislation may take time to introduce. The latest news on pricing comes as the CMA said it would examine whether retailer loyalty scheme discounts really offer a good deal and if they could disadvantage some groups of shoppers in an investigation that formally kicked off on Tuesday. The CMA said in November it was to investigate schemes such as Tesco‚Äôs Clubcard Prices and Sainsbury‚Äôs Nectar Prices amid concerns they could limit competition and stoke price rises for shoppers not signed up to such marketing schemes. The schemes, which offer immediate discounts for loyalty cardholders, have been credited with helping Sainsbury‚Äôs and Tesco fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl in the last year. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sainsbury‚Äôs was the fastest-growing of the traditional supermarkets and even outpaced Aldi in the three months to 21 January, according to Kantar. Sales at the UK‚Äôs second largest supermarket rose by 8.1% handing it a 15.7% share of the UK take-home grocery market, while Aldi‚Äôs sales rose by 7.2%. Tesco‚Äôs sales rose by 6.3%, taking its stake in the market to 27.6%. Sainsbury‚Äôs began offering special discounts for its Nectar card holders and the Co-op brought in members‚Äô pricing last year, and both have gradually ramped up their programmes. Tesco, which has the longest-running scheme, has increased the prevalence of its Clubcard discounts in the past year. Lidl launched a loyalty scheme in 2020 and updated it in 2022 so that shoppers had to spend more to get the top level of discounts. The CMA said on Tuesday it had begun speaking to supermarkets about the subject and expected to release an update in July. It said it had yet to form any views on the subject but would be investigating ‚Äúwhether any aspects of loyalty pricing could mislead shoppers,‚Äù including whether the discounts were ‚Äúa genuine promotion or as good a deal as presented‚Äù. Other topics it will look at include whether the schemes are affecting consumer behaviour in a way that could affect competition and if any groups of shoppers could be disadvantaged by the schemes. The consumer group Which? said it had asked the regulator to look at whether supermarkets could be raising ‚Äúregular‚Äù prices to make it appear that loyalty scheme customers are getting a better deal than they actually are."

        "content": "Flutter, the FTSE 100 gambling firm that owns Paddy Power, Betfair and Sky Bet, has been teasing us for the past year about moving its primary share listing to the US ‚Äúin due course‚Äù. Now, on the first day of New York trading in its shares in add-on secondary form, the company says it likes the place so much it wants to go all in. Shareholders will vote in May on a proposal to relegate the London listing to secondary status, which would amount to making it virtually irrelevant, and adopt New York for the primary. The lure of membership of the S&P 500 index beats the (dwindling) prestige of the Footsie. Flutter ‚Äì a top-20 stock with a market value of ¬£28bn ‚Äì is a bad one for London to lose. Other high-profile departures had stronger stories to tell. BHP Billiton was always Australian, so Sydney was the right venue to unify a clunky, dual-headed corporate structure. Plumbers‚Äô merchant Ferguson had sold almost all of its UK assets by the time it left. Flutter‚Äôs arguments are sketchier. While everybody understands that the US gambling market is booming and will soon represent the company‚Äôs biggest geographical source of profits, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily follow that the ‚Äúnatural home‚Äù, as chief executive Peter Jackson puts it, for the shares must also be the US. Many large Footsie companies, from AstraZeneca and Shell downwards, make substantially more money in the US than they do in the UK. Indeed, about 75% of Footsie firms‚Äô aggregate earnings are estimated to come from overseas. Flutter is perhaps unusual in that its head office is in Dublin and past acquisitions, including the purchases of FanDuel, the US operation, and Canada-based PokerStars have added to the international flavour on the shareholder register. These days, US-based investors own 53% of the shares, according to Bloomberg data. Even so, if alarm bells weren‚Äôt already sounding at the London Stock Exchange Group (and chief executive David Schwimmer often gives the impression he hasn‚Äôt heard them), they should be now. You can‚Äôt live for ever off past Anglo-Dutch unification victories for London such as Unilever and Relx, especially when you failed to bring Arm Holdings back to the UK market. The exchange could do with some help from the dwindling band of UK loyalists. While US shareholders dominate at Flutter, the UK-based percentage is still 21.4%, which is not nothing in the context of a special resolution that requires a 75% majority. How should the UK crew respond to Flutter‚Äôs intended flight? One hopes they vote against. It would at least send a message to other wannabe escapees in UK boardrooms that exiting to the US is not as easy as flicking a switch. For those funds that are allowed to own stocks only within UK or European indices, this ought to be a no-brainer. They will become forced sellers of a company with good long-term growth prospects and won‚Äôt receive a takeover premium by way of compensation. From where they sit, that proposal should have zero appeal. It is a moment to be irritating in a (probably) doomed cause."

Zero growth in the single currency zone in the final quarter of last year followed a 0.1% economic contraction in the third quarter, meaning that recession ‚Äì defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction ‚Äì was just averted. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the eurozone‚Äôs economy to shrink by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The eurozone‚Äôs two biggest economies both performed poorly in late 2023, with Germany contracting by 0.3% and France posting no growth for a second successive quarter, according to Eurostat, the EU‚Äôs statistical agency. There was better news from the other two members of the eurozone‚Äôs ‚Äúbig four‚Äù. Italy, which had been expected to stagnate, recorded growth of 0.2%, while Spain expanded by 0.6% ‚Äì three times the 0.2% forecast. Of the smaller eurozone economies, Portugal grew by 0.8% in the final quarter, Austria expanded by 0.2%, while Ireland‚Äôs economy contracted by 0.7% ‚Äì its fourth successive quarterly fall in 2023. Eurostat said that the broader 27-nation European Union also posted no growth in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023, the eurozone expanded by just 0.1%, while the EU grew by 0.2%. ‚ÄúThe eurozone economy escaped recession by the skin of its teeth by the end of 2023,‚Äù Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said. ‚ÄúThe outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions.‚Äù   Related: Eurozone GDP: Germany on brink of recession, as France stagnates; UK shop price inflation falls ‚Äì business live   The eurozone‚Äôs stagnating economy will further pressurethe European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the countries in the monetary union, to start cutting borrowing costs.  Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank, said: ‚ÄúA technical recession has just been avoided in the eurozone. Still, the eurozone economy has now been broadly stagnating since late 2022 and has lost substantial ground to the US in terms of GDP in recent years. After the buoyant post-pandemic reopening phase, the economy has now entered a phase of prolonged weakness.‚Äù Since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, the eurozone has been struggling to cope with higher energy and food prices, and the damage caused to business and consumer confidence. The ECB raised interest rates last year to their highest level since the euro was launched in 1999. Nicola Mai, economist at asset manager Pimco, said: ‚ÄúDespite a resilient early start in 2023, the eurozone economy was weak through much of the year, and we anticipate that this fragility will persist in 2024. ‚ÄúThe reasons for this ongoing weakness are clear. Europe is still recovering from a lingering energy shock and has not experienced the same degree of fiscal stimulus as the more resilient US economy in recent years. The region‚Äôs shorter debt maturities also mean that interest rate hikes have been felt more quickly.‚Äù"

        "content": "A delivery rider for Hungry Panda is launching legal action against the company over claims she was denied work on the app for promoting protest activity over pay and safety. Zhuoying Wang used TikTok and WeChat to promote a stop-work meeting in Sydney, a meeting she had helped organise over rider pay and safety. Wang alleges that during the protest she received no orders on the app. The Transport Workers Union wrote to Hungry Panda last week, claiming Wang was given just five orders, which was extremely low for a public holiday.   Related: Uber warning that food delivery prices could spike 85% shows gig workers are underpaid, experts say   A table of Wang‚Äôs orders over the past two months, provided to Guardian Australia, show that during the 10-hour days she worked, she completed between 30 to 70 orders per shift, but this dropped down to zero around the protest and in the days following.  Sign up for Guardian Australia‚Äôs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  A spokesperson for the TWU said Wang would file a case with the Fair Work Commission alleging a breach of section 346 of the Fair Work Act, which protects workers from adverse action for engaging in industrial activity. The company in 2021 allegedly kicked off two workers from its platform after organising a protest against rate cuts. It reportedly claimed it was due to customer and restaurant complaints but the two drivers were later restored on the platform. The TWU said one of the riders, Jun Yang, is a lead organiser of a protest on Wednesday over a drop to the base rate for delivery riders from $7 to $4 for motorcycle riders, and $6 to $5 for bicycle riders. The union said a bonus scheme designed to give riders one-off payments for completing a number of deliveries in a set time frame, had been introduced. It claims this is unrealistic and unsafe. ‚ÄúFood delivery riders are racing towards death under pressure to keep up with unrealistic delivery deadlines imposed by algorithms,‚Äù TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said. ‚ÄúWorkers just trying to make a living are pushed to rush, are pitted against each other in an overcrowded rider pool, and have had their pay rates arbitrarily go backwards, forcing them to work longer, harder and faster to put food on the table.‚Äù On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Hungry Panda said the company supports delivery riders‚Äôs rights to express concerns and engage in lawful protests. ‚ÄúWe are diligently investigating Ms Wang‚Äôs claims to ensure our platform maintains fairness and transparency,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúIn the light of concern, we want to clarify that Ms Wang‚Äôs account has always stayed active, and is still currently active hence her ability to accept orders is not restricted.‚Äù The company said it was open to engaging in constructive dialogue with Wang and the union to address concerns. The union called on the Senate to pass law reforms guaranteeing minimum standards for the gig economy industry as soon as possible. ‚ÄúThis ordeal just goes to show how volatile this industry is without minimum standards in place. While Uber, DoorDash and Menulog are supportive of reform to set standards in the gig economy, Hungry Panda is clearly the outlier,‚Äù Kaine said."

        "published_date": "2024-01-30T09:00:24+00:00",
        "content": "The Bank of England has shelved a ¬£250,000 plan to revamp its museum, adding at least a year to more than five years of debate about how to provide a focal point for financial education in England and Wales. As a recently launched parliamentary inquiry into the state of financial education in English schools progresses, the central bank‚Äôs move shines a spotlight on the UK‚Äôs lowly position in international league tables for the general understanding of financial matters. The UK is ranked 15th out of 29 countries for financial literacy by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), despite having the largest and most powerful financial services industry in Europe. The Bank‚Äôs latest decision on the path of interest rates, due on Thursday, could send people in the UK scrambling to examine their mortgage rates if policymakers hint at an early move. Robin Walker, the Tory MP for Worcester and chair of the all-party education committee conducting the inquiry, says the UK needs to use its expertise ‚Äúto help children and adults better understand money and economics‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe should welcome more opportunities for them to understand the role of finance and financial services. Institutions like the Bank of England need to play a part in that education,‚Äù he adds. In the time since officials at the Bank began considering a revamp of the only money museum in England and Wales, a string of museums have opened or been overhauled at a cost of more than ¬£100m. The Museum of Making in Derby, based in the world‚Äôs first fully mechanised factory has opened after an ¬£18m project. The Imperial War Museum in London has undergone a ¬£30.5m refit and the Museum of the Home in east London, has expanded at a cost of ¬£18m. The Bank‚Äôs museum is housed on the ground floor of its grade-I listed building on Threadneedle Street and displays rare coins, cash registers and a collection that includes historically prominent women on banknotes. An exhibition on the City‚Äôs links to slavery closes next month. The museum, which usually attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year, will soon host an exhibition on digital payments, asking: ‚ÄúCan the tooth fairy go cashless? Are cryptoassets money?‚Äù The Bank refused to explain the decision to delay a refurbishment that was expected to introduce interactive exhibits to supplement the displays of coins and memorabilia that take up most of the space. It is understood museum staff have faced constraints that apply to any building with a Grade I-listing ‚Äì in this case the architect Sir John Soane‚Äôs neo-classical fortress that stands opposite the Royal Exchange in the heart of London‚Äôs financial district. Heritage regulations raise the costs of a revamp and limit what staff can do to refresh exhibits dating back to the Bank‚Äôs foundation in 1694.  It museum‚Äôs only rival in the UK is Edinburgh‚Äôs Museum on the Mound, which also examines ‚Äúthe story of money‚Äù and has about 50,000 visitors a year. Like its London-based counterpart, it is not an independent institution, after being set up and run by Bank of Scotland, which is now part of Lloyds Banking Group. To give a comparison, the Science Museum group, which operates London‚Äôs Science Museum, the Science and Industry Museum, National Railway Museum, Locomotion, and National Science and Media Museum, expects 5 million visitors in 2026. Walker‚Äôs review is focused on the financial education of school-age children and how teachers can incorporate basic concepts into the maths curriculum. The Labour party has already pledged to teach more of the maths curriculum through the prism of household budgeting, currency exchange rates for going on holiday, sports league tables and cookery recipes. The thinktank Centre for Social Justice carried out research in 2022 that found two-thirds of young adults who experienced financial difficulties believed better financial education could have helped them. The government-funded Money and Pensions Service (MaPS) estimated in 2020 that 4.8 million children had received ‚Äúa meaningful financial education‚Äù. It wants to increase the number to 6.8 million by 2030. MaPS research found that half of 18- to 24-year-olds report feeling anxious when thinking about their money, while about two-thirds (65%) of the same age group could not add interest earned to a savings balance or understand compound interest. Just over half (55%) of young people aged 16 and 17 are not able to read a payslip correctly. Sara Weller, the chair of the MaPS, said: ‚ÄúExperts are clear, that children form a view of money before they are seven years old and currently we don‚Äôt have a framework for teaching it until secondary school level, when children are already 11 years old.‚Äù However, the plan to expand financial literacy in schools faces an uphill task. A study by the Bank in 2022 found almost two-thirds of teachers felt there was not time or resources to fit the subject into the school year. The most prominent exhibition in recent years to debate the importance of money was staged last year at the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is funded by the University of Cambridge. Under the title, Defaced! Money, Conflict, Protest, the show focused on money as a medium for protest and dissent and ‚Äúhighlighted the small defacements on coins and notes, which revealed the opinions of people who otherwise went unheard‚Äù. Much of the exhibition is on tour, but not in the UK ‚Äì it can now be seen at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada. Dr Richard Kelleher, the exhibition‚Äôs curator, says: ‚ÄúThere was a noticeable demographic shift in the age of visitors to Defaced! compared with other shows, with the biggest proportion in the 45-54 range and a definite increase in the number of younger people coming to the museum.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúPart of the appeal of exhibitions about money is their ability to connect with the visitor. For better of worse money is a constant part of our lives and we all have a relationship with cash. ‚ÄúWe covet it, don‚Äôt have enough of it, try to hide it, worry about it, try to grow it. For these reasons and others we have a means to connect. Money exhibitions can play a powerful role in developing visitors‚Äô financial literacy; particularly driving a better understanding of the banking system, debt, assets and liabilities, inflation and concepts of value, through creative presentations of the history of money. Sharon Heal, the director of the Museums Association, says an independent money museum to house permanent exhibitions could fall foul of a funding crisis that is forcing many museums to consider restricting opening hours or higher charges for special exhibitions. ‚ÄúThere is money for capital spending but the cuts to revenue budgets are severe,‚Äù she says. The largest and most advanced money museum in the world is the Interactive Museum of Economics in Mexico City. Funded by the central bank, government departments, big commercial banks and financial institutions, but with an independent charter, it is housed in a refurbished convent in the heart of the city. Among exhibits of old coins, the museum boasts a trading room with virtual reality headsets that can turn a classroom of children into day traders. There is also a ‚ÄúFuture of Money‚Äù room that allows visitors see how digital money is created and to experiment with different ways to pay electronically. There are no proposals to set up an independent economics or money museum in the UK and a revamp of either of the existing museums in London or Edinburgh seems a long way off."

        "content": "HSBC has been fined ¬£57m by the Bank of England‚Äôs financial stability arm for failing to protect customer deposits in the event of a banking collapse. It is the second-highest fine imposed by the Bank‚Äôs Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and reflects the seriousness of the failings, the watchdog said. The highest fine was ¬£87m, imposed on Credit Suisse last July. HSBC failed for many years to properly implement the requirements set out in the depositor protection rules, the PRA said. The failings occurred between 2015 and 2022. The fine was imposed on two UK subsidiaries of HSBC Holdings, which are deemed to have the ‚Äúcapacity to cause significant disruption to the UK financial system if they were to fail‚Äù.   Related: Lloyds to cut 1,600 jobs across branches in shift to online banking   The bank failed to accurately identify deposits that were eligible for Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection, which insures deposits if a bank collapses. HSBC lacked ‚Äúadequate systems and controls, and governance‚Äù necessary to enable FSCS to make prompt payments to depositors in the case of a banking collapse, the PRA said. It added that the failings had ‚Äúmaterially undermined the firm‚Äôs readiness for resolution‚Äù. The PRA said the bank failed to alert the regulator about problems identified in the incorrect marking of accounts as eligible for FSCS protection over 15 months. HSBC also breached other rules that state that lenders must prepare for resolution with a minimum disruption of critical services in the event of a banking collapse. Sam Woods, the PRA chief executive and deputy governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England, said: ‚ÄúThe serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA‚Äôs safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution. ‚ÄúHSBC Bank plc fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today‚Äôs action, including the significant fine.‚Äù The bank cooperated with the regulator throughout the investigation and agreed to resolve the matter, which meant the fine was reduced; otherwise it would have been ¬£96.5m. The PRA said HSBC failed to assign a senior manager to the resolution processes required in the event of a banking failure. HSBC Bank plc, the non-ringfenced part, also incorrectly marked 99% of its eligible deposits as ‚Äúineligible‚Äù for FSCS protection. HSBC said it was ‚Äúpleased to have resolved this historic matter, which relates to the bank‚Äôs compliance with certain parts of the PRA‚Äôs depositor protection rules. ‚ÄúThe PRA‚Äôs final notice recognises the bank‚Äôs cooperation with the investigation, as well as our efforts to fully resolve these issues. We continue to remain focused on serving our customers.‚Äù"

        "content": "The term ‚Äúbracket creep‚Äù is getting thrown around with wild abandon at the moment, so we might as well get a handle on what it means and work out if it is actually all that important. So  what is bracket creep?   Related: The stage-three tax cut changes could be a pivotal moment for Anthony Albanese ‚Äì if he frames them right | Peter Lewis   Slow down, there; first we have to talk about marginal tax rates. In Australia, we tax income at different levels (or ‚Äúbrackets‚Äù) depending on how much you earn. The more you earn, the higher your marginal tax rate in that bracket. That‚Äôs ‚Äúprogressive taxation‚Äù and it is done in pretty much every country, because the more you earn, the more capacity you have to pay. Alright, I‚Äôm with you. Australia currently has five different tax brackets:  0-$18,200 ‚Äì 0% tax $18,201-$45,000 ‚Äì 19% tax $45,001-$120,000 ‚Äì 32.5% tax $120,001-$180,000 ‚Äì 37% tax $180,000+ ‚Äì 45% tax  It looks like this:    If the graph does not display click here What is that ‚Äúaverage rate‚Äù line? That‚Äôs there because the marginal tax rates only apply to money you earn in those brackets. Imagine you earn $80,000. You pay no tax on the first $18,200 you earn, 19% tax on the $26,800 you earn between $18,200 and $45,000, and then you pay 32.3% on the $35,000 you earn above $45,000 So your $80,000 is taxed like this:  On the first $18,200, you pay 0% tax. On the next $26,800, you pay 19% tax. On the remaining $35,000, you pay 32.5% tax. In total, on your income of $80,000, you end up with a 20.6% average tax rate.  That leaves you with $63,533 after tax. I assume we are going to get to bracket creep at some point? Yep, we‚Äôre nearly there. Now assume you get a 5% pay rise, because inflation has also gone up 5%. Now your income is $84,000, and this is how it is taxed:  On the first $18,200, you pay 0% tax (no change). On the next $26,800, you pay 19% tax (no change). On the remaining $39,000, you pay 32.5% tax. In total, on your income of $84,000, you end up with a 21.2% average tax rate.  That leaves you with $66,233 after tax. And that is bracket creep. All that happened is you got a pay rise to keep pace with inflation, but the tax system doesn‚Äôt account for inflation so you were taxed at a higher average rate.   Related: Toto the tax cut cavoodle explains the updated stage-three tax cuts! | First Dog on the Moon   So what‚Äôs the big deal? Well, it means your ‚Äúbefore tax‚Äù income went up 5% but your ‚Äúafter tax‚Äù income only went up 4.2%. So, your real wage after tax went down. And that is bracket creep. And why is this complicated? Politicians will often try to tell you bracket creep is something else. For example, when he was trying to sell the stage-three tax cuts, the then treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told parliament that stage three ‚Äúwill tackle bracket creep. If you get another job or a promotion, or you do some overtime, you won‚Äôt necessarily pay a higher marginal rate of tax.‚Äù But if you get a promotion or another job that pays more, that‚Äôs not bracket creep ‚Äì that is just you getting a better paying job, and under progressive taxation you are now able to pay a bit more in tax. You will still be better off. Why would he or anyone else try to say that‚Äôs bracket creep? Did you miss the part about how he was trying to sell the stage-three tax cuts? Bracket creep actually affects lower-income people more because wage rises mean a bigger change in the amount of their income that is taxed at a higher rate. By June, inflation will have risen around 17% since the tax rates were last changed, so the impact of bracket creep looks like this:    If the graph does not display click here But now let‚Äôs include the old stage-three tax cuts:    If the graph does not display click here The old stage three was all about giving the biggest tax cuts to those on the highest income, but they are not as affected by bracket creep, so all the talk about it curing bracket creep was a bit of a fib. It was about a high-income tax cut. So if bracket creep is about inflation, why not just increase the thresholds by inflation? That would do it, but the question is what year you choose to start increasing the thresholds from. Why not from now? So you think the tax system designed by Scott Morrison is the one we should stick to? Errr ‚Ä¶ can I say no? What about the 2006-07 scales? If we had increased the top tax threshold in line with inflation from then, $150,000 would now be $237,596. Or should we go from the 2004-05 financial year when the top threshold was $70,000? If we had increased that in line with inflation it would now be just $117,724.    If the graph does not display click here This is getting complicated. That‚Äôs the problem with ‚Äúfixing‚Äù bracket creep. Indexing the thresholds means picking a moment and essentially suggesting that was the ideal level of tax rates. If we look at the percentage of tax paid by the richest 10% and the bottom 50%, you can see that the old stage three essentially wanted things to be as they were at the end of the Howard years when the top decile paid around 47% of tax. The new stage three mostly changes them back to where they were at the end of the Gillard years, when the top 10% of income earners paid 49% of tax:    If the graph does not display click here So that‚Äôs it? One last thing.  Why is bracket creep bad? Because I pay more tax just because of inflation? And why is that bad? Doesn‚Äôt tax pay for services, such as health and education and roads, the cost of which has also gone up due to inflation?   Related: Guardian Essential poll: one in two voters back stage-three tax cuts changes   Yeah, but ‚Ä¶ And shouldn‚Äôt the governments we vote for be the ones to decide tax rates rather than some arbitrary moment in time being the point we decided to make it automatic? Well, sure, but ‚Ä¶ And Australia already is a low taxing nation when it comes to income. Compared to other nations in the OECD, we don‚Äôt tax income much at all:    If the graph does not display click here And the average tax rates we pay are less than the UK and US.    If the graph does not display click here And will you actually want to work less? Wait, what? Economists like to say that bracket creep is a disincentive on work, because as your marginal tax rate rises, you are apparently less likely to want to earn more money because doing so could take you into a higher tax bracket. Is that real? Do you think about marginal and average tax rates when you are offered a higher-paying job? And would you turn down a promotion because your average tax rate might go from 20.6% to 21.2%? No. Correct. Most people don‚Äôt, but it looks good in theory when we assume people act like a calculator. The ones who really care about such things are those on low and middle incomes who get less childcare subsidy and other benefits once they earn over a certain amount. For people in those situations, and also those paying off Hecs, there can be times where earning more money makes you worse off. So shouldn‚Äôt we be more focused on those people? Now you‚Äôve got it.

        "content": "As China‚Äôs most embattled ‚Äì and indebted ‚Äì property developer is ordered to liquidate, the effects that Evergrande‚Äôs collapse will have on investors, debt holders and the hundreds of thousands of homebuyers who have paid deposits for homes remains uncertain. Evergrande, the Chinese property developer, was worth just $275m on Monday, down 99% from its peak in 2017. It owes more than $300bn to various creditors, according to its most recent financial report. In a scathing judgment delivered in Hong Kong‚Äôs high court on Monday, Justice Linda Chan said ‚Äúenough is enough‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is indisputable that the company is grossly insolvent and is unable to pay its debts,‚Äù Chan wrote, as she ordered the company to liquidate its assets.   Related: Xi Jinping says Chinese business having ‚Äòtough time‚Äô in new year message   But enforcing that order will be the next challenge and the queue of creditors who are lining up is likely to remain for many months. Evergrande can still appeal against Monday‚Äôs ruling. More importantly, over 90% of its assets ‚Äì which include more than 1,300 housing projects in 280 cities ‚Äì are in mainland China, a separate jurisdiction from Hong Kong, where it is far from clear if Justice Chan‚Äôs order will be enforced. ‚ÄúGood luck enforcing,‚Äù says Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of J Capital research. She recalled that when Kaisa, another Chinese property developer, defaulted on its debts in 2015, local governments in China took control of Kaisa developments and renamed them, in some cases physically barring Kaisa staff from accessing the properties. This means that foreign bondholders ‚Äì including Top Shine Global, which brought the winding-up petition against the Evergrande ‚Äì will be ‚Äúhung out to dry‚Äù, says George Magnus, an economist and associate at Soas University of London. And a bailout is unlikely. The Chinese government ‚Äúcertainly don‚Äôt want to give priority to making good the losses of foreign creditors over domestic citizens,‚Äù says Magnus. ‚ÄúThat just wouldn‚Äôt be a good look. So to the extent that somebody is going to pay a price, it will be the foreign bondholders.‚Äù With tumbling Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets, a predictable commercial insolvency process is an important pillar in determining whether or not foreign companies will want to continue investing in China. It will be the steps taken by Beijing that will shape the extent to which foreign investors can feel confident that their investments into Chinese companies will be treated fairly. But many analysts believe that the mood music for this has already been set. ‚ÄúTo the extent that companies have been gradually and gingerly shying away from future investment decisions in China ‚Ä¶ [Evergrande‚Äôs impact] is pretty neutral,‚Äù said Magnus. The question now is whether or not the crisis for the company that was once the jewel of China‚Äôs property sector will have repercussions throughout the wider financial system. Analysts have warned against predictions of China‚Äôs ‚ÄúLehman moment‚Äù, when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers bank in 2008 became a crisis for the US economy. Experts at China Beige Book, a financial research firm, said that ‚Äúcontagion is near impossible‚Äù because Beijing maintains a tight control over the wider financial system. On Sunday, Chinese state media reported that the government plans to merge three of the country‚Äôs biggest debt managers into the sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, a move that analysts have pointed to as an example of Beijing taking over the restructuring of financial institutions rather than bailing them out or paying out to creditors. Evergrande can still challenge Justice Chan‚Äôs decision. The company‚Äôs executive director called the judgment ‚Äúregrettable‚Äù but said that operations would continue in mainland China, according to the BBC. That will matter to the many homebuyers who have made down payments on properties on which Evergrande has halted construction. In 2021, when Evergrande‚Äôs troubles first emerged, some 1.6 million homebuyers were in limbo as the company had taken their deposits without delivering their homes. In a country where nearly three-quarters of household wealth is tied to property, the future of Evergrande‚Äôs assets will be a major concern for the hundreds of thousands of ordinary Chinese whose nest eggs may be about to disappear."

        "content": "Taxpayers are not being guaranteed value for money or transparency at a regeneration project overseen by the Conservative Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, according to a review that cleared it of cronyism and corruption. An independent review of Teesworks, one of the highest-profile, government-backed regeneration schemes in Britain, found the project was excessively secretive and could not ensure public money was being well spent. However, the reviewers said there was no evidence to support allegations of corruption or illegality at the industrial project, which is central to the Teesside freeport, in a wider programme championed by Rishi Sunak. In an otherwise damning review, the panel made 28 recommendations to improve transparency and decision-making at the project, which is overseen by the rising Tory star Houchen‚Äôs South Tees Development Corporation (STDC) and companies run by two local developers. The review into the project at Redcar was ordered by the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove in May 2023. The land at the centre of the row has been described as Europe‚Äôs largest brownfield site and was once home to the town‚Äôs steelworks. ‚ÄúWe have found no evidence to support allegations of corruption or illegality. However, there are issues of governance and transparency that need to be addressed and a number of decisions taken by the bodies involved do not meet the standards expected when managing public funds,‚Äù the review said. The heavily delayed report said the systems of governance at Houchen‚Äôs Tees Valley combined authority and STDC did ‚Äúnot include the expected sufficiency of transparency and oversight across the system to evidence value for money‚Äù. It also warned of what appeared ‚Äúto be a persisting theme or culture of excessive confidentiality/lack of transparency‚Äù. In a letter to Houchen, Gove acknowledged ‚Äúsome specific areas for improvement and lessons to be learned‚Äù but underlined that the report made ‚Äúclear that the panel found no evidence of corruption or illegality‚Äù. Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of parliament‚Äôs business and trade committee, said the report showed the need for the National Audit Office to investigate Teesworks. ‚ÄúMr Gove has praised Teesworks as a flagship for freeports yet today‚Äôs report highlights ‚Äòdecisions taken by the bodies involved do not meet the standards expected when managing public funds‚Äô,‚Äù said Byrne. ‚ÄúSo it [would] now be wise to have a NAO investigation into the value for money for this project that funnelled ¬£124m profit to a firm that actually did very little to invest significantly in creating jobs.‚Äù Justin Madders, a shadow business minister, said the report was a ‚Äúdamning one‚Äù as ‚Äúthe issue has always been one of value for money‚Äù, and on that the report showed ‚Äútaxpayers money was not being spent in the way the public would expect‚Äù. The report, he continued, shows a ‚Äúsystemic and flawed decision making process that hinders transparency and fails to show value for money. ‚ÄúThis scandal has exposed gaps in accountability and serious questions remain about the lack of local democratic scrutiny throughout this process.‚Äù Madders added: ‚ÄúNo amount of bluster will make this a good deal for the taxpayer and nothing they [government ministers] say will change the view still held by many that something is seriously wrong in the Tees Valley.‚Äù Lee Rowley, the housing minister, said the review showed ‚Äúno corruption, no illegality‚Äù and had recommended improvements that he was confident would be put into action. The row over Teesworks has been an acrimonious one, with the Middlesbrough MP, Andy McDonald, using parliamentary privilege to accuse Houchen of ‚Äútruly shocking industrial-scale corruption‚Äù. Houchen responded by calling McDonald a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and a ‚Äúcoward‚Äù for failing to repeat the allegations away from the Commons chamber. The mayor welcomed the report, ‚Äúwhich sets out in black and white that there is no corruption or illegality at Teesworks‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúI welcome the recommendations of the panel and my team and I are already working to review the recommendations to improve our processes and procedures in line with the report‚Äôs findings.‚Äù Afterwards, McDonald said: ‚ÄúThis report is absolutely damning and what is clear is there are massive concerns about governance and finance, oversight, scrutiny, value for money ‚Äì all of the things that I have said over these years. ‚ÄúThe system is completely flawed and as a net result we have got the enrichment of a handful of businessmen making money hand over fist at no risk whatsoever. Where is the morality in that? Where is the value for money and due diligence? Are we really saying we are content with that?‚Äù"

        "content": "BP is under pressure from a hedge fund to ditch a strategy that will see it cut its oil and gas output in favour of investing in clean energy. London-based Bluebell Capital Partners has written to BP arguing that the FTSE 100 energy company‚Äôs strategy has depressed its share price and presumed a ‚Äúdrastic decline in oil and gas demand, which we consider to be utterly unrealistic‚Äù. BP was already undergoing significant changes under former chief executive Bernard Looney, who had set a course to cut oil output by a quarter compared with 2019 levels by the end of the decade ‚Äì making it the only oil major to pledge to cut output, albeit having reduced its ambitions. The company has also invested in green energy such as solar, wind and biofuels, and it is looking at green hydrogen production as it considers ways to make money once oil demand falls. Looney was ousted as chief executive in September after admitting he failed to fully inform the BP board about relationships with colleagues. He was later formally dismissed and denied more than ¬£32m in pay and share awards over ‚Äúserious misconduct‚Äù. However, BP is still run by supporters of Looney‚Äôs strategy. Chairman Helge Lund appointed Looney‚Äôs former finance boss, Murray Auchincloss, as chief executive. Bluebell co-founders Giuseppe Bivona and Marco Taricco wrote in their letter that they would have called for Looney‚Äôs resignation had he not left. The letter was sent in October, shortly after it acquired a small stake in BP. Bluebell is a relatively small but influential fund which has previously mounted campaigns against French food company Danone, where it played a part in the departure of its chief executive, as well as in Glencore, where it failed in its efforts to have the UK-listed commodities company sell its thermal coal operations. However, it only manages about $150m across a dozen or so companies, meaning it does not have the financial might to force BP into a shareholder vote. Bivona told the Guardian that the company was made up of ‚Äúpassionate environmentalists‚Äù, and that the fund manager was ‚Äúnot telling BP to stay away from clean energy‚Äù. However, he said he wanted BP to ‚Äústay away from businesses in which they have no right to win‚Äù and where investment returns are low, such as solar and offshore wind. In the 30-page letter, which was first reported by the Financial Times, Bluebell argued that BP was worth 50% more than its share price implied, and called for it to increase production in the next few years and pledge only to cut emissions ‚Äúin line with society‚Äù. BP‚Äôs shares traded at 466p on Monday, valuing the company at ¬£79bn. Bluebell‚Äôs calls for a change in strategy will face opposition from BP‚Äôs leadership and also from environmentalists, many of whom argue that the company is still not doing enough to cut emissions. The International Energy Agency in 2021 said that no new oil and gas fields should be drilled if the world is to limit temperature increases. Mark van Baal, head of Dutch activist group Follow This, has in recent years forced shareholder votes at BP, Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil calling for stronger emissions reduction targets. ExxonMobil is taking legal action to try to dismiss a resolution for its next annual meeting. Van Baal questioned whether Bluebell would gain much shareholder support, and argued that BP‚Äôs share price under performance versus peers was related to its decision to cut its dividend in 2020. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think responsible shareholders will allow a conservative investor to slow down a transition that is already moving far too slowly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLetters don‚Äôt change companies; shareholders‚Äô votes do. Let them file a shareholder resolution and see how many shareholders support going back in time. We don‚Äôt think they will get much votes.‚Äù A BP spokesperson said the company ‚Äúwelcomes constructive engagement with our shareholders‚Äù and that it has received support for its strategy after recent meetings with most major shareholders. The spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe continue to make significant progress, remain focused on delivery, and are confident the strategy will grow the value of BP and deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders.‚Äù"

        "content": "  3.31pm GMT  Closing post  Time to wrap up‚Ä¶ Amazon has dropped its planned acquisition of the Roomba vacuum cleaner maker iRobot, days after it was reported the EU was preparing to block the deal. The e-commerce company will pay a $94m break fee to iRobot, which immediately announced plans to axe 31% of its workforce ‚Äì or 350 employees ‚Äì and the departure of its chief executive. The Wall Street Journal had reported on 18 January that the EU‚Äôs executive arm was preparing to block the deal and had informed Amazon of its proposed view. Amazon and iRobot said in a joint statement the takeover had ‚Äúno path to regulatory approval in the European Union, preventing Amazon and iRobot from moving forward together‚Äù. iRobot is now planning 350 jobs cuts, or almost a third of its workforce, as it tries to cut costs.   Related: Amazon drops $1.4bn deal to buy iRobot after EU veto reports   In other news‚Ä¶ Online betting company Flutter is proposing moving the primary listing of its shares from London to New York, as its shares start to trade on Wall Street for the first time today. The change is subject to shareholders‚Äô approval at a vote in May, and would be another blow to the London Stock Exchange, even though Flutter would keep a secondary listing here. The oil price hit its highest level since November, before dropping back, as tensions in the Middle East rose after three US troops were killed in drone strike yesterday and an oil tanker was hit by a missile on Friday night.

They say:  Amazon‚Äôs proposed acquisition of iRobot has no path to regulatory approval in the European Union, preventing Amazon and iRobot from moving forward together‚Äîa loss for consumers, competition, and innovation.       1.55pm GMT  IRobot to lay off 31% of staff  There‚Äôs more bad news for iRobot‚Äôs workers today. Following the collapse of its takeover by Amazon, the robot vaccum maker is cutting 350 jobs, or over 30% of its workforce. The cuts are part of an operational restructuring plan which includes making $80-$100m of cost savings. IRobo also plans to cut its R&D spending by $20m year-over-year, by outsourcing more non-core engineering functions to ‚Äúlower-cost regions‚Äù, and to cut marketing spending by $30m.  The company is also pausing all work related to non-floorcare innovations, including air purification, robotic lawn mowing and education. There‚Äôs change at the top too ‚Äì co-founder Colin Angle is stepping down as chairman and CEO. Andrew Miller, the new chairman of the Board, says:  ‚ÄúiRobot is a pioneer of the consumer robot field and beloved by its customers around the world. With a legacy of innovation and a foundation of creativity, the Board and I believe that iRobot can ‚Äì and will ‚Äì grow its presence and continue to build a cutting-edge suite of robotic floorcare solutions that help consumers make their homes easier to maintain and healthier places to live.  To do this successfully, however, we must rapidly align our operating model and cost structure to our future as a standalone company. Though decisions that impact our people are difficult, we must move forward with a more sustainable business model, and a renewed focus on profitability.      1.44pm GMT  Amazon's iRobot takeover collapses in face of EU opposition  Newsflash: Amazon‚Äôs takeover of robot vacuum maker iRobot has collapsed. The teo companies have announced they have agreed to terminate the agreeement that Amazon would buy iRobot for $1.7bn, which was agreed in August 2022. Instead, Amazon will pay iRobot a $94m termination fee. The move follows reports that the European Union‚Äôs competition watchdog planned to block the deal, due to concerns that it could restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners. iRobot‚Äôs gadgets include the Roomba i7, a wifi-connected vacuum cleaner that it claims maps and learns rooms and empties itself when full. David Zapolsky, Amazon SVP and General Counsel, says the e-commerce giant is ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù that the deal could not proceed, adding:   ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre believers in the future of consumer robotics in the home and have always been fans of iRobot‚Äôs products, which delight consumers and solve problems in ways that improve their lives. Amazon and iRobot were excited to see what our teams could build together, and we‚Äôre deeply grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly to try and make this collaboration a reality.‚Äù  Zapolsky adds that customers will be denied ‚Äúfaster innovation and more competitive prices,‚Äù insisting:  Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren‚Äôt subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics. Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition‚Äîthe very things that regulators say they‚Äôre trying to protect.‚Äù   Last June, the UK‚Äôs competition watchdog cleared the deal, after an inquiry.     1.08pm GMT  Flutter could shift primary stock market listing to New York  Flutter, the gambling firm behind Betfair, Paddy Power, PokerStars and FanDuel, has revealed it is keen to move its primary stock market listing to Walll Street. Flutter Entertainment is set to list on the New York stock exchange today as it aims to capitalize on America‚Äôs online sports betting boom. It has hailed its landing on the New York stock exchange as a ‚Äúpivotal moment‚Äù as its business continues to surge in the United States.   Related: FanDuel owner Flutter to list in New York amid US gambling boom   Flutter, which is already listed in London, told investers this morning that it cancelled its secondary listing on Euronext Dublin today. It says listing on the NYSE will unlock long-term strategic and capital market benefits, and ‚Äì worryingly for the City ‚Äì it says the move gives ‚Äúoptionality to pursue a primary listing in the US‚Äù. Flutter explains:  Since February 2023, management has engaged widely with US investors, existing and potential, along with existing shareholders globally. The feedback received has been very supportive of moving Flutter‚Äôs primary listing to the US. As a result, the Board believes that the NYSE is now the optimal location for Flutter‚Äôs primary listing of its shares, and that the transition should be made as soon as practicable.  Shareholders will be asked to vote on whether to move the listing at Flutter‚Äôs AGM, on 1 May. Flutter‚Äôs board says it intends to retain Flutter‚Äôs UK listing as a secondary listing, but losing another primary listing to New York would be a blow to the London Stock Exchange, following the exit of building materials group CRH last year.

The FT says:  In a document drawn up by EU officials and seen by the Financial Times, Brussels has outlined a strategy to explicitly target Hungary‚Äôs economic weaknesses, imperil its currency and drive a collapse in investor confidence in a bid to hurt ‚Äújobs and growth‚Äù if Budapest refuses to lift its veto against the aid to Kyiv.  Hungary has concemned this plan as ‚Äúblackmail‚Äù and vowed to defy EU pressure. Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has faced criticism from both Brussels and Washington for trying to thwart EU aid to Ukraine and slowing the ratification of Sweden‚Äôs membership of NATO.     11.28am GMT  Lloyds to scrap mobile bank branches  Lloyds Banking Group is shutting down its mobile banking service this year. The banking van service was set up to serve rural towns and villages where the local Lloyds branch had been closed. But the bank is now planning to scrap the Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland mobile branches in May. Lloyds argues that the service, which lets people cash cheques, withdraw cash, pay bills or send money abroad, are being used by fewer customers ‚Äì just a handful in some cases. A spokeswoman said:   ‚ÄúCustomers have used our mobile branches much less over time and some locations now have as little as two customers using the service. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be introducing more community bankers, alongside the other options customers already have for their banking, including the Post Office, online, our mobile apps, phone banking, video services and web chat.‚Äù  The move comes days after Lloyds laid out plans to 1,600 staff from its branch network as it tries to reduce costs and push customers towards digital services.

The euro has dropped by almost 0.5% today, lifting sterling to ‚Ç¨1.1740, the highest since late August. Against the dollar, the euro has lost 0.33% to $1.082. The ECB left its key rate on hold at a record-high 4% on Thursday, and the money markets today are fully pricing in a 25-basis-point cut in April. Nearly 1.5 percentage points of eurozone rate cuts are expected by the end of this year. In contrast, the first rate cut by the Bank of England isn‚Äôt fully priced in until June, although many traders expect a May cut.   GBP rises against the Euro with EURGBP ahead of the BoE on Thursday with focus on divergence between ECB and BoE, as a rate cut in April fully priced in by market for the ECB.

Centeno argued that the ECB needn‚Äôt wait for updated wage data due in May, before acting, as some policymakers believe, saying:  ‚ÄúThere is a lot more information, and (being) data-dependent is not (being) wage-data dependent...we don‚Äôt need to wait for May wage data to get an idea about the inflation trajectory.‚Äù  But another ECB policymaker, Peter Kazimir of Slovakia, argued today that the first cut is more likely to come in June than April.

Evergrande, which holds the ignominious title of the world‚Äôs most indebted property developer with about $300bn in liabilities, failed to convince the court that it had a viable restructuring plan, after having been given seven extensions since court proceedings were first brought in June 2022. However it can still appeal. Justice Linda Chan delivered the ruling on Monday morning, saying ‚Äúit is time for the court to say enough is enough‚Äù.

The day-ahead price of natural gas in the UK has jumped 3.65% to 71 per therm, while the month-ahead contract is 2.75% higher at 71.25p/therm. On Friday, the White House announced that it was pausing all pending export permits for liquified natural gas (LNG) due to climate concerns. The move could threaten more than a dozen gas export terminals that have been planned for the Gulf of Mexico coast, but the Biden administration insisted the pause will have no immediate effect on US gas supplies to Europe or Asia.

Swedish GDP grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, new data from Statistics Sweden shows, despite a 0.3% contraction in December. Mattias Kain Wyatt, economist at Statistics Sweden, says net exports strengthened in the quarter, while the domestic economy was weaker. Sweden‚Äôs economy has been hit hard by rising borrowing costs, which pushed up mortgage costs for many households. Sweden had fallen into recession last autumn, after its GDP shrank in both the second and third quarters of last year.     8.56am GMT   Yesterday, Israel was warned that its sovereign credit rating could be cut if the war with Hamas expands to other fronts. The warning came from a director at S&P Global Ratings, which in October cut the outlook on Israel‚Äôs ‚ÄòAA-‚Äô rating to ‚Äúnegative‚Äù from ‚Äústable‚Äù. Maxim Rybnikov, director of EMEA Sovereign & Public Finance Ratings at S&P, told Reuters:  ‚ÄúThe negative outlook on the ratings implies that we currently see at least a one-in-three chance of a downgrade over the next one to two years.‚Äù   Rybnikov added that if Israel‚Äôs security and geopolitical risks were to increase due to an escalation of the conflict - a direct confrontation with Hezbollah in Lebanon or Iran - it could lead to a downgrade, explaining:  ‚ÄúWe could also lower the ratings if the impact of the conflict on Israel‚Äôs economic growth, fiscal position, and balance of payments proves more significant than we currently project.‚Äù      8.42am GMT  UK job vacancies fall by most since 2020 as labour market cools  More gloom: the UK job market is facing one of the most difficult starts to the year in four years.

Early data also anticipates that January could be equally tough, with vacancies expected to decrease again, by between -6% and -8%, Adzuna warn. Teaching was the only area to see a rise in vacancies, while there were large monthly falls in retail (-17.94%), manufacturing (-17.05%), hospitality & catering (-14.13%) and trade & construction (-13.56%).     8.36am GMT  Ryanair cuts profit forecast after being removed from online booking sites  Ryanair has cut its profit forecast for the year, after several online travel agents (OTAs) stopped selling its flights.

Supply of homes has picked up ‚Äì with 22% more properties for sale than a year ago, while the number of sales agreed are up 13% year on year. Zoopla say:  While the start of the year has been positive for the sales market, it‚Äôs important not to get carried away by the outlook for the rest of 2024. We remain in a buyer‚Äôs market with plenty of choice for would-be movers. Zoopla‚Äôs data shows a small but not insignificant number of sellers continue to cut asking prices to ensure homes attract sufficient interest, continuing the trend from the second half of 2023.  With a fifth of sellers accepting more than 10% below the asking price, seller‚Äôs realism has given new year sales levels a 13% year-on-year boost, says property agent Emma Fildes of Brick Weaver, adding:  In turn, bolstered by the promise of base cuts, demand and supply have increased with many buyers turning back to city living. For those with larger deposits who‚Äôve been trying to ‚Äútime the market‚Äù, now seems a good time to pick up a bargain before any further rate cuts bring other buyers to the negotiating table. A lot rides on inflation and global stability, but for now, hopes are high that 2024 can‚Äôt be any worse than 2023, and potentially a little better.

Trafigura says it is assessing the security risks of further Red Sea voyages while the UK government has said Britain and its allies ‚Äúreserve the right to respond appropriately‚Äù. These developments have left investors fretting that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas could escalate into a more significant regional and international crisis. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains:  The Houthis‚Äô continued attacks on ships in the Red Sea, including a tanker carrying Russian fuel, have prompted ongoing U.S. airstrikes in Yemen. Iran‚Äôs actions risk inviting a more robust U.S. air campaign against its regional assets, highlighting the precariousness of the situation and the potential for further escalation. Concerns about the risk of miscalculation are growing, as rational actors may unintentionally become entangled in an escalatory spiral. Given the inherent complexity of Middle East conflicts, achieving a stable outcome in the region appears unlikely at this stage, signalling the potential for continued instability with broad global repercussions where higher oil prices are the chief concern, especially in a severe supply disruption scenario, where maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz is chocked leading to significant rise in prices.      7.41am GMT  Introduction: Profit warnings from UK-listed companies exceed those issued in 2008  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. High interest rates and weakening confidence have been blamed for pushing more UK companies into issuing profit warnings. New data from EY-Parthenon this morning show that over 18% of public firms issued warnings in 2023, which is a higher proportion than at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008 In total, 294 profit warnings were issued by businesses in 2023, which is a slight drop on the 305 in 2022 ‚Äì highlighting how tough the last two years have been for companies. Over a quarter of warnings (26%) in 2023 were attributed to delayed contracts or decisions, 19% were due to increased costs and a further 19% cited the impact of higher interest rates. The survey showed that profit warnings blamed on rising costs fell through the year, but there was an increase in warnings blamed on corporate spending delays and higher borrowing costs. During 2023, 39 listed companies issued their third or more consecutive profit warning in 12 months. Jo Robinson, EY-Parthenon Partner, says:  ‚ÄúPervasive uncertainty in 2023 created major challenges for businesses around earnings and forecasting, and this is reflected in the number of profit warnings issued last year. While pressure around costs eased somewhat toward the year-end, the uptick in warnings caused by delays to business decisions and weak consumer confidence indicates an ongoing reluctance to commit to discretionary spending.  Firms issuing profit warnings in 2023 included online shopping group THG, which blamed delivery disruption, contract delays and falling sales at one division, Kingfisher, the owner of B&Q and Screwfix, and drinks giant Diageo, while shoemaker Dr Martens racked up four profit warnings in the year. And looking ahead, Robinson adds:  ‚ÄúIn 2024, businesses will hope for a quicker-than-expected fall in inflation and interest rates, but many moving parts need to slot into place before we can be sure of an economic ‚Äòsoft landing‚Äô. We expect to see increasing disparity between businesses that are positioned to capitalise on still limited growth and those that are hampered by the impact of recent earnings pressures or their access to and the cost of capital. It is shaping up to be an easier year for many, but not all UK companies.‚Äù  The agenda  7am GMT: Sweden‚Äôs GDP report for Q4 2023 10am GMT: Belgium‚Äôs GDP report for Q4 2023 3.30pm GMT: Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index for January   "

        "content": "One of the world‚Äôs largest gambling companies listed in New York on Monday, describing the stock exchange as its ‚Äúnatural home‚Äù amid the US‚Äôs online sports betting boom. Flutter Entertainment, owner of FanDuel, promptly announced that it will go a step further ‚Äì and switch its primary listing from London, where it is right now, to New York ‚Äì ‚Äúas soon as practicable‚Äù. Its business has surged in the United States in recent years. Flutter generated sales of ¬£3.6bn ($4.59bn) in the US last year ‚Äì up from ¬£191m ($243m) in 2018, when the US supreme court struck down a decades-old law that prohibited sports betting across much of the country. FanDuel, with its rival operators DraftKings and BetMGM, has led the sharp-elbowed race to dominate the nascent US online gambling market. Peter Jackson, chief executive of Flutter, said it soon expects the US to generate ‚Äúthe largest proportion‚Äù of its profits. ‚ÄúWith our NYSE listing effective today, this is a pivotal moment for the group as we make Flutter more accessible to US-based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets.‚Äù Ditching its primary listing in London would set the stage for Flutter to exit Britain‚Äôs FTSE 100 stock index. It will put the plan to shareholders in May.   Related: Are UK employers going too far with strict rules on workplace relationships?   Listed on the London stock exchange and headquartered in Dublin, Flutter has already dropped a second listing in Dublin to join the New York stock exchange: a move designed to boost its profile, and grant it access to more money, in the US. In a regulatory filing ahead of the switch, Flutter described ‚Äúa long runway‚Äù for future growth ‚Äì but acknowledged that concerns around problem gambling could ‚Äúsignificantly influence‚Äù future regulation of its industry, prompt investigations and dissuade people from placing bets. Sports betting‚Äôs liberalization across the US has been so transformative for Flutter that Jackson has floated making 18 May ‚Äì the day of the supreme court decision ‚Äì a company holiday. It agreed to acquire a controlling stake in FanDuel just days after the 2018 ruling. Five years ago, the group (then known as Paddy Power Betfair) relied on the US for about 10% of its business; by last year, the market was responsible for almost 40% of its sales. While sports betting is now legal in 36 states and Washington DC, major states including Texas have yet to follow. Flutter is confident they will. California voters rejected the prospect in 2022, but the company described ‚Äúmultiple ongoing initiatives‚Äù to change the state‚Äôs stance in its filing. ‚ÄúThe expectation is that legalized sports betting will be back on the ballot in the near future.‚Äù Wall Street is bullish, too. Online gambling is a ‚Äúhyper growth industry‚Äù in the US, said Joe Stauff, an analyst at Susquehanna, a trading firm. ‚ÄúFanDuel has a huge competitive advantage.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù added Mike Hickey of Benchmark, an investment bank. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just getting started ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to be a massive market in the US.‚Äù But Flutter noted in the filing that ‚Äúsocial responsibility concerns‚Äù could ‚Äúsignificantly influence the regulation of online betting and iGaming and impact responsible gaming requirements, could result in investigations and litigation, and may adversely impact our reputation.‚Äù The industry claims to already be highly regulated. It has pushed back hard against proposals in Congress to ban gambling advertising in the US and divert tax receipts from sports wagers towards problem gambling treatment programs. ‚ÄúAs markets mature, usually regulation follows,‚Äù said Hickey. ‚ÄúRegulation is always a concern, for sure. And it‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù"

        "content": "At the start of the pandemic, Ceola Luna, a 45-year-old Lyft driver in Los Angeles, bought a 2005 Saturn Vue crossover, after her new Dodge Caravan (a minivan) was wrecked in a crash. The Vue wasn‚Äôt nearly as nice, but it was affordable at $4,000 ‚Äì including rust, engine issues and a dashboard full of warning lights. With no other income to support herself and three children, driving was an economic lifeline for Luna. But much of what she made ended up going to car mechanics as the small SUV kept breaking down. Then last year, Lyft informed Luna that her Vue had gotten too old for the platform, leaving her jobless. So she scrambled to find a new gig as a care worker for autistic children, and then the car failed again. To save up for another mechanic appointment, Luna has been taking the bus to her clients ‚Äì sapping her earnings with hours of unpaid commute time. A replacement car is out of the question, because she barely has enough money for rent. But even if Luna had the funds to go shopping, it‚Äôs unlikely she would find anything remotely reasonable. The average new car today sells for nearly $49,000, and the average used car lists at more than $26,000 ‚Äì representing a 31% increase for new cars and nearly 40% increase for used cars since 2020, according to data from the industry group Cox Automotive. These increases have brought the total cost of car ownership to all-time highs in a country where cars aren‚Äôt really optional. And that‚Äôs despite the easing of inflation and the supply chain issues that snarled the auto industry during the pandemic. So why are consumers still getting squeezed?   Related: SUVs drive trend for new cars to grow 1cm wider in UK and EU every two years, says report   Here‚Äôs a hint: the automakers are doing great. By essentially coordinating an industry-wide production cut, the pandemic gave manufacturers power to demand mind-boggling prices for fewer cars, leading to record profits. As consumers adjusted their expectations, executives saw an opportunity to establish a lucrative new normal. Low inventory is an ‚Äúopportunity to drive strong margins‚Äù, GM‚Äôs CEO, Mary Barra, told shareholders in 2022. Ford‚Äôs CEO, Jim Farley, went even further, declaring: ‚ÄúI want to make it extremely clear to everyone: we are going to run our business with a lower day supply than we have had in the recent past because that‚Äôs good for our company.‚Äù Brian Moody, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, a car industry publication, says automakers used the pandemic to shift product lines toward higher-margin products. Instead of small cars and base models, they pivoted to luxury cars and SUVs with fully loaded trims, which turn far greater profits per sale. That means ‚Äúthe less expensive the car, the fewer choices you have‚Äù, says Moody. Some commentators have called the trend ‚Äútrimflation‚Äù. A 2023 Cox Automotive report declared that ‚Äúthe US new vehicle market is becoming a luxury market‚Äù, a ‚Äúseismic shift‚Äù that, for many buyers, is ‚Äúabout as enjoyable as a sharp stick in the eye‚Äù. But the hurt isn‚Äôt limited to car buyers; it‚Äôs spread to car owners as well. Like Ben Valdez, who supplements his $60,000 salary as a computer tech at a California community college by driving for Uber in an older-generation Toyota Prius with 280,000 miles. Because Uber deems drivers independent contractors, Valdez is on the hook for all maintenance costs, which have ballooned: ‚ÄúThree years ago, I was probably paying as little as $50 for an oil change. Now I‚Äôm looking at no less than $100, and I‚Äôve seen it as high as $150 for just four quarts of synthetic oil.‚Äù The cost of car tires has gone up by more than half. Even the price of a car wash, something Valdez needs to do regularly to keep passengers happy, has gone from about $25 to nearly $45, he says. The cost of insurance has brought even more pain. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average cost of car insurance rose more than 14% between the end of 2021 and 2022, before soaring another 20% by the end of 2023, the largest one-year increase since the 1970s. Divya Sangameshwar, an insurance expert at Value Penguin, says those rapid increases have several causes. One is that the rising cost of vehicles and maintenance means insurers have to pay out more when things go wrong. Another is that more vehicles are getting ravaged by the climate crisis. The vehicle data company Carfax estimates that Hurricane Ian destroyed as many as 358,000 cars as the storm tore through Florida and the Carolinas in 2022. The climate crisis, in turn, is only being exacerbated by the trend toward massive vehicles. Unless action is taken to reverse climate change, Sangameshwar says, ‚Äúit is undeniable that it will continue to have an impact on auto insurance premiums for the next 100 years‚Äù. Until 2022, state governments, which approve rate increases, had been keeping insurance premiums relatively flat for years, leading to ‚Äúpent-up pressure‚Äù among some insurance companies, which ‚Äúwere threatening to walk out of markets where they weren‚Äôt profitable any more‚Äù, Sangameshwar says. But now that states have relented, insurers are doing splendidly. Companies like Progressive and Travelers reported record-breaking profits this year thanks to the big rate increases, and they say more rate increases are on the way. Over the last two decades, American jobs have become increasingly dispersed throughout the suburbs, says David King, an associate professor of urban planning at the Arizona State University. Research shows that car-owning Americans have access to far more job options, and ‚Äúhaving a reliable car means that you‚Äôre more likely to be able to keep that job‚Äù, King says. The preferred solution of many planners ‚Äì replace car trips with transit ‚Äì faces difficult odds in this country. Across the United States, transit riderships remain much lower than pre-pandemic numbers, and with Covid-era federal grants due to expire this year, many transit authorities are planning service cuts, sparking fears of a ‚Äúdeath spiral‚Äù. That‚Äôs why King says it‚Äôs just as important in the short run to make cars more affordable for people who need them ‚Äì a proposal he calls ‚Äúuniversal auto access‚Äù. The planner envisions government subsidies for lower-income people to buy or maintain cars, paired with new incentives and regulations to steer manufacturers back toward smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This car-positive proposal doesn‚Äôt make him popular among planning circles, King concedes. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs a realist approach: this is the world that we have, and we can still work for a better world while not leaving some people out of it.‚Äù"

        "content": "More than 3 million BT customers could receive up to ¬£400 each as a class action lawsuit begins seeking ¬£1.3bn in compensation over claims the telecoms group allegedly overcharged for landline services. The legal action has been brought by Justin Le Patourel, a former executive of the watchdog Ofcom, and alleges that BT used its dominant position in the market to charge ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù amounts for about 3 million landline customers, many of them elderly and low-income households. Le Patourel launched the claim three years ago after looking into an Ofcom investigation into BT in 2017.   Related: Virgin Media is most complained about UK broadband provider   Ofcom‚Äôs investigation, which looked at BT‚Äôs practices from 2015, found that people who only had a landline telephone were ‚Äúgetting poor value for money in a market that is not serving them well enough‚Äù. BT cut landline prices the following year for 1 million mostly elderly customers by ¬£7 a month but did not offer them compensation for overcharging in the past. Le Patourel, who formed Collective Action on Land Lines (Call) to gather customers in a class action against BT, estimates that affected customers could get ¬£300 to ¬£400 in compensation depending on the length of their contracts. ‚ÄúWe believe BT has been systematically overcharging millions of customers over many years, and those customers could be owed hundreds of pounds each,‚Äù Le Patourel said. ‚ÄúTime really is of the essence. More than 40% of our claimants are aged over 70, and more than 150 of them are dying every day. It really is vital that BT should refund every one of them as soon as possible.‚Äù The class action automatically includes all affected customers ‚Äì including those who are now deceased, after BT gave consent to an amendment to the claim ‚Äì unless they actively choose to opt out. Le Patourel claims that more than 500,000 landline-only customers have already died. A spokesperson for BT said: ‚ÄúThis claim relates to a technical landline pricing issue which was resolved by Ofcom in 2017. We do not accept that our pricing was anti-competitive back then, and as such are committed to robustly defending our position at trial. We take our responsibilities to customers very seriously and are dedicated to keeping our customers connected, while helping those who need it most.‚Äù However, when Le Patourel took his case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal in 2021 seeking permission to take BT to trial, the three-member tribunal was unanimous in ruling that the claim showed more than enough merit to be pursued. ‚ÄúWe conclude that there is a real prospect of success for this claim,‚Äù the tribunal concluded in its 42-page ruling at the time."

        "content": "Ryanair has lowered the top end of its estimates for profits this year after a number of online travel agents abruptly removed flights from the Irish airline from their websites. The removal is part of a long-running spat between Ryanair and online travel agents including Kiwi, Lastminute and Opodo, which the airline describes as ‚Äúpirates‚Äù because of alleged ‚Äúscamming‚Äù by charging customers higher fees. Despite the feud, Ryanair appeared to be taken by surprise by the removal of flights from travel agents‚Äô websites in December. That caused the load factor, or the proportion of seats occupied on each plane, to drop by a percentage point. Ryanair responded by dropping prices to try to fill seats.   Related: After the latest Max crisis, Boeing must focus on flight, not finance   The airline said on Monday it would narrow its guidance for profit after tax for the full year to a range of between ‚Ç¨1.85bn (¬£1.58bn) and ‚Ç¨1.95bn, after previously saying profit could reach as high as ‚Ç¨2.05bn. Profits were also affected by a 35% increase in the airline‚Äôs fuel bill. However, despite the hit to profits, Ryanair‚Äôs overall passenger numbers rose 7% to 41.4 million in the last three months of 2023 compared with the equivalent period the year before. Ryanair‚Äôs near-constant increases in passenger numbers have made it one of the world‚Äôs most valuable airlines, but also the most polluting carrier in Europe in terms of carbon emissions. Ryanair warned that its profit guidance ‚Äúremains heavily dependent upon avoiding unforeseen adverse events‚Äù in the final quarter of its financial year, such as new instability from Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas conflict. It also highlighted the risk of further delays in deliveries of new aircraft from Boeing. Ryanair signed a deal for new Boeing 737 Max aircraft in December 2020, receiving a significant discount for backing the US manufacturer at a time of significant scrutiny after two deadly crashes caused by design flaws. Ryanair has since taken delivery of dozens of new jets, but further deliveries could be delayed after regulators blocked accelerated production because of a non-fatal accident earlier this month. The Alaska Airlines flight lost a door plug in mid-air, apparently because of failures in securing the part on the new plane. Kiwi, Lastminute and Opodo were approached for comment. Ryanair shares were down 2.7% on Monday."

The British brand is drawing up plans for potential store closures and job cuts after it reported last week that sales dropped by nearly a quarter in the six months to October. The delayed results were accompanied by the appointment of a new finance boss, the fifth in five years. The company, which has about 3,350 staff and more than 215 stores, on Monday said it had hired ‚Äúadvisers to explore the feasibility of various material cost saving options.‚Äù   Related: John Lewis considering cutting 11,000 jobs after slashing redundancy terms   It added: ‚ÄúWhile there is no certainty that any of these options are progressed, they aim to build on the success of the cost saving initiatives carried out by the company to date and position the business for long-term success.‚Äù Monday‚Äôs announcement came in response to a report on Saturday by Sky News saying Superdry was considering a significant number of store closures and job cuts with the consultancy PwC. Those cuts could come as part of a company voluntary arrangement or a restructuring, either of which would involve Superdry working with creditors to try to make its debts manageable. Superdry‚Äôs market value has slumped in recent years. Its share price reached ¬£19 in 2017, but was just 17p on Monday, giving it a value of ¬£17.5m. Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 as a market stall in Cheltenham, growing it into one of the most successful names on the UK high street selling T-shirts, jeans and coats. However, Superdry has struggled in recent years, and has gone through a turbulent few years after Dunkerton left before forcing his way back in a 2019 boardroom coup. In recent months, Superdry has blamed its poor sales on the general weakness of the fashion market, with deep discounting by rivals, as well as milder weather that has prevented people from spending on winter items such as coats. The company on Monday emphasised that it is already looking at steep cost cuts, with ¬£40m already earmarked, compared with a previous aim of ¬£35m. It said it had already made ¬£20m of those cuts."

        "content": "Train drivers will keep striking to ‚Äúraise the profile‚Äù of their dispute after half a decade without a pay rise, the Aslef union has warned, before another week of rolling strikes across England. Aslef‚Äôs general secretary, Mick Whelan, has said he believes that the government will make renewed efforts to see train companies use controversial new anti-strike laws, despite the union forcing a climbdown this time round. An overtime ban will begin to disrupt services from Monday, before trains are halted for 24 hours at national train operators around England in rolling strikes from Tuesday.   Related: Train drivers call off extra strike days after LNER minimum service law U-turn   Drivers will strike at Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Thameslink and South Western Railway on Tuesday 30 January; at Northern Trains and TPE on Wednesday 31 January; at LNER, Greater Anglia and C2C on Friday 2 February; at West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast and East Midlands Railway on Saturday 3 February; and at Great Western, CrossCountry and Chiltern on Monday 5 February. No trains at all are likely to run at most operators on their respective strike days, with other services likely to be much busier where they provide alternative routes for passengers. The set of strikes was expected to be the first test of the minimum service levels legislation, designed to allow train operators to run 40% of the normal timetable. Only LNER, one of the three operators directly run by the Department for Transport, planned to use the new powers to demand that drivers break the strike. An immediate escalation by Aslef, which called five additional days of strikes at LNER, prompted a climbdown. Rail industry bosses as well as unions had made clear their reservations in consultations and select committee hearings ahead of the strike laws being introduced, which could also be applied in health, education and firefighters disputes. Labour has said it will immediately repeal the laws if elected. Speaking to the Guardian before the latest industrial action, Whelan said: ‚ÄúWe made the point that it was unworkable, we believed it was terribly unsafe. We made the point, which was borne out by the government‚Äôs own impact assessment, that it would lead to more strife. Rather than trying to resolve the situation, they tried to introduce forced labour into the country, to our eternal shame. ‚ÄúFirst time they‚Äôve tried it, they‚Äôve backed off. I‚Äôm of the view they‚Äôll try it again. Nobody can tell us how to safely do it.‚Äù Separately, the Public and Commercial Services Union said on Saturday it would use the Human Rights Act to challenge the minimum service law. The announcement was made by the PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, at a rally to mark the 40th anniversary of the ban on trade unions at the GCHQ headquarters. After the threatened extended rail strikes on the London-Newcastle-Edinburgh mainline, and potential for more elsewhere, the more localised 24-hour disruption of rolling walkouts may be a relief for passengers. However, given the lack of progress in more than 18 months of strikes, what does Whelan hope to achieve? ‚ÄúWell, there are two choices in life ‚Äì to do something or do nothing. And we don‚Äôt actually have the choice to do nothing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got drivers who in February [will] have gone five years without a pay deal ‚Äì half a decade. People who put their lives at risk during a pandemic, to get other key workers to work and move food and medicine around the country.‚Äù The strikes would, Whelan said, ‚Äúkeep raising the profile of our dispute until somebody comes to the table to resolve it with us. I‚Äôd happily go back into talks tomorrow to find a way forward ‚Äì even though we‚Äôve been crapped on from a great height twice before when we‚Äôve gone into long-term talks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gone in in good faith, and at the end the Rail Delivery Group and the government behaved dishonourably and deceitfully. Still, we have to find a way to resolve it.‚Äù An overtime ban starting on Monday will apply at all of the companies throughout the strike period. It is likely to cause additional disruption for operators such as TransPennine Express that rely on rest day working. The RDG has advised passengers to check before they travel, while those who have to travel should expect disruption, plan ahead and check when their first and last train will depart. A spokesperson for the RDG said: ‚ÄúThere are no winners from these strikes that will unfortunately cause disruption for our customers. We believe rail can have a bright future, but right now taxpayers are contributing an extra ¬£54m a week to keep services running post-Covid. ‚ÄúAslef‚Äôs leadership need to recognise the financial challenge facing rail. Drivers have been made an offer which would take base salaries to nearly ¬£65,000 for a four-day week before overtime ‚Äì that is well above the national average and significantly more than many of our customers that have no option to work from home are paid.‚Äù A DfT spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThe transport secretary and rail minister have already facilitated talks that led to this fair and reasonable offer from industry ‚Äì Aslef bosses should put it to their members so we can resolve the dispute, which has already happened with the RMT, TSSA and Unite unions. ‚ÄúWith passenger revenues not having recovered since the pandemic, the taxpayer has had to prop up the railways with ¬£12bn in the past year alone ‚Äì these strikes will not change the need for urgent workplace reforms that Aslef continue to block.‚Äù"

        "content": "Embattled Chinese development company, Evergrande, has been ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court after an 18-month long hearing. Evergrande, which holds the ignominious title of the world‚Äôs most indebted property developer with about $300bn in liabilities, failed to convince the court that it had a viable restructuring plan, after having been given seven extensions since court proceedings were first brought in June 2022. However it can still appeal. Justice Linda Chan delivered the ruling on Monday morning, saying ‚Äúit is time for the court to say enough is enough‚Äù. The liquidation petition was lodged by Top Shine in June 2022, an investor in Evergrande unit Fangchebao which said the developer had failed to honour an agreement to repurchase shares it had bought in the subsidiary.   Related: Evergrande, the ‚Äòrunaway‚Äô developer that could become a wrecking ball for China‚Äôs economy   Evergrande had been working on a $23bn debt revamp plan but this fell apart in September when the company announced its founder, billionaire Hui Ka Yan, was under investigation for ‚Äúsuspected illegal crimes‚Äù. Provisional liquidators will be announced on Monday afternoon. They will be expected to take control of Evergrande assets, negotiate with creditors on debt restructuring, and take over management of the company. But the process is expected to be complicated and have little impact on the company‚Äôs operations in the immediate term. Offshore liquidators, appointed by creditors and tasked with taking control of Evergrande‚Äôs subsidiaries in mainland China, could take months or years, and would probably face difficulty in the process. China is a different jurisdiction to Hong Kong, and in previous cases like developer Kaisa group, and solar company Suntech, the processes had been ‚Äúmurky‚Äù, said analyst Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of J Capital research. ‚ÄúI think the point is there isn‚Äôt really an orderly legal process.‚Äù Redmond Wong, chief China strategist at Saxo Markets, said the likelihood of Evergrande shareholders in Hong Kong getting anything out of the winding up process was ‚Äúvery low‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor overseas creditors, focus will be on if the liquidator will succeed in its applications for assistance to mainland courts in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xiamen under the cooperation mechanism re-established in 2021 and get hold of assets in the mainland.‚Äù Trading was halted in China Evergrande, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, and Evergrande Property Services, after the verdict. Shares were already trading down as much as 20% before the hearing on Monday. It was unclear on Monday how the ruling would impact the industry and China‚Äôs struggling economy. Stevenson-Yang said much of the impact of Evergrande‚Äôs woes had already been felt after it defaulted in 2021. Since China‚Äôs central government tightened regulations in 2020, companies responsible for about 40% of Chinese home sales have defaulted. China is grappling with an underperforming economy, its worst property market in nine years and a stock market wallowing near five-year lows, and its government has been making intense interventions. ‚ÄúThis kind of desperation of the Chinese government to support the stock market, and now I hear they‚Äôre merging all these asset management companies into the [sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp], just really kind of hoping they can continue to kick the ball down the road,‚Äù she said."

        "content": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks is preparing to mount a defence of its decision to cut thousands of jobs at the south Wales plant, and float the possibility of creating more UK jobs in future, during testimony to MPs this week. The Indian conglomerate Tata confirmed this month that it planned to close two blast furnaces at Port Talbot ‚Äì shedding up to 2,800 jobs, with a further 300 potential redundancies at another site, in Llanwern. The company and the government have faced criticism from MPs and unions, who argued that jobs could have been saved with greater investment and state support.   Related: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a betrayal‚Äô: Port Talbot anger over Tata Steel‚Äôs decision to close furnaces   Tata Steel‚Äôs global chief executive, TV Narendran, and its UK chief executive, Rajesh Nair, will appear before MPs on the Welsh affairs committee on Wednesday as the impact of the company‚Äôs decision on the local community, Wale‚Äôs economy and the future of the UK steel sector is examined. Tata‚Äôs decision to close the blast furnaces ‚Äì along with a parallel decision by Chinese-owned British Steel in Scunthorpe ‚Äì has caused consternation among MPs because it would leave the UK unable to make primary steel directly from iron ore. In a document sent this weekend to employees and the government, and seen by the Guardian, Tata Steel attempted to ‚Äúfactcheck‚Äù claims made in coverage of its decision, which it said had presented a ‚Äúmisleading picture‚Äù. Tata is expected to argue that it is open to investment in a new plant to make direct reduced iron (DRI), a technology that can produce iron using methane or hydrogen that would then go into the new electric arc furnaces. The big advantage of the DRI process is that it is possible to produce steel with zero carbon emissions, meaning it is likely to play a key role in decarbonisation. It would also replace about 200 of the jobs under threat at Port Talbot, Tata said ‚Äì although that would still leave thousands out of work. The document said: ‚ÄúTata Steel has also made clear that, with the right investment and policy environment, it is open to further investment, such as in a direct reduced iron (DRI) plant. We would look at the case for a potential DRI plant in the UK if the business conditions are right and, if in future, the government supported further investment.‚Äù The document also directly addresses the prospect of a Labour government, adding that the company ‚Äúis open to further investment in the future‚Äù but that it wants to turn the Port Talbot plant to profit first. Labour has said it will invest ¬£3bn in the steel industry, and it is seriously considering backing hydrogen steelmaking as an option. However, some politicians, including local MPs, may look sceptically at any suggestion that Tata should be given hundreds of millions of pounds more in subsidies shortly after it has received about ¬£1bn in pledged support. Half of that will support Port Talbot‚Äôs switch to electric arc furnaces ‚Äì remaking new steel from the UK‚Äôs abundant scrap ‚Äì while the rest will help Tata, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, build a gigafactory to make batteries for electric cars. The company‚Äôs executives are to claim that Tata has been ‚Äúan incredibly patient investor‚Äù in the UK steelworks since acquiring it in 2007, but that it has made no profit or dividends. It is understood that the document contains the core arguments Narendran and Nair intend to make at the committee hearing. The committee will also hear evidence from Vaughan Gething, the minister for the economy for the Welsh government, as well as representatives of the Community, GMB and Unite unions. Tata plans to import semi-finished steel slabs from sites in India and the Netherlands before the electric arc furnace is operational in 2027. The GMB is expected to argue that the steel imported while the EAF is being built is likely to have a high carbon content, even before the emissions generated in transit to the UK are taken into account. The unions have previously criticised Tata for highlighting its emissions reduction efforts in the UK, while at the same time building a new, polluting blast furnace at Kalinganagar, in its home country of India."

        "content": "UK politics is stuck in a holding pattern. Ever since Liz Truss‚Äôs seven-week stint as prime minister, opinion polls have been consistent: the Conservatives are on course for a thumping defeat. Historical precedent suggests the race should get tighter as the election approaches but there is currently no evidence of that happening. In fact, Labour‚Äôs lead seems to be getting bigger. What is worrying for the government is that its political plight seems to be getting worse even though the economic news has been getting modestly better. The big development in recent months has been the sharp fall in inflation, which has had two significant knock-on effects: it has reduced interest payments on the national debt and led to mortgage lenders reducing home loan rates in anticipation of lower interest rates from the Bank of England. The first has provided Jeremy Hunt with some extra budget wriggle room; the second has already started to lead to a gentle revival in housing market activity.   Related: Chancellor considers further national insurance cut to take heat off Rishi Sunak   Have voters noticed? If they have, there is scant evidence that they give the Conservatives any credit. As a result, the idea of an early election ‚Äì which was being toyed with a couple of months back ‚Äì has been ditched. The chancellor has not yet abandoned all hope of victory but wants the election delayed until the autumn, by which time the Bank should have started to cut interest rates and the effects of tax cuts will have be showing up in pay packets for several months. There is even talk of squeezing in another package of tax cuts in the autumn, which really would be a desperate last roll of the dice. In reality, the Conservatives are now looking at damage limitation rather than victory ‚Äì and even that will require not just tax cuts but also significant reductions in interest rates. This Thursday the Bank will provide its quarterly assessment of the state of the economy and announce its latest decision on interest rates. It is a stone-cold certainty that official borrowing costs will be left at 5.25% but of more interest will be Threadneedle Street‚Äôs steer on what happens next. In its November 2023 health check, the Bank stressed that interest rates were likely to remain high for an extended period and might need to rise if there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. The best judgment of its nine-strong monetary policy committee was that inflation would not return to its 2% target until the end of 2025. In the light of subsequent events, that now looks far too pessimistic. Analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics think tumbling energy prices will bring the annual inflation rate down from 4% now to 1.8% in April and to just 0.9% in September. If the Capital Economics forecasts are anywhere near correct, the Bank will soon come under strong pressure to cut interest rates, pressure that it is likely to resist for only so long. There is sure to be a softening of its stance on Thursday, with talk of further rate rises dropped and perhaps an indication of cuts, provided the fall in inflation is sustained. For now, the MPC is likely to take a cautious approach. It will point out that the labour market remains tight and that core inflation ‚Äì which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco ‚Äì is still above 5%. The Bank will be monitoring pay settlements closely as the 2024 pay round gets under way. It is also likely to warn that financial markets are getting carried away in expecting four quarter-point cuts this year and that there is a risk that the sort of rapid and aggressive easing of policy currently expected by the City might lead to inflation being above its 2% target in 2026. But rates have peaked at 5.25% and the next move will be down. Threadneedle Street will be interested to see what Hunt decides to do in his budget on 6 March but you don‚Äôt need a crystal ball to work out what is going to happen. Frankly, it is not a question of whether or not the chancellor cuts personal taxes because that decision ‚Äì as he made clear in comments made in Davos earlier this month ‚Äì has already been taken. The real issue is by how much he cuts them, and the signs are that he might have about ¬£20bn to play with. That‚Äôs not to say cutting income tax and again freezing fuel duty for motorists is the best use of ¬£20bn. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, there is a high risk that any tax cuts now will be paid for by tax rises or spending cuts after the election. It is certainly not hard to think of better uses for a ¬£20bn windfall. Current Treasury plans involve a ¬£20bn cut in public investment by 2028-29, which Hunt could reverse if he chose to do so. That would boost long-term growth potential rather than consumer spending. Alternatively, he could spend the money on repairing the UK‚Äôs threadbare welfare safety net. In a report released last week, Donald Hirsch, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University, said the system was failing to meet the most basic needs, concluding: ‚ÄúToday, we do not have a safety net worth its name.‚Äù That‚Äôs a disgrace but only someone not really paying attention would imagine that the last budget before an election is going to be devoted to making the social safety net fit for purpose. Governments facing a wipeout will always find a way to cut taxes even if the chances of them having a material impact on the election ‚Äì as in this case ‚Äì are vanishingly small."

        "content": "Kemi Badenoch has suggested there could be a wider shake-up at the Post Office over the Horizon scandal and other problems, after she asked its chair to leave at the weekend. The business secretary said she had needed to intervene as there were ‚Äúdifficulties with the board‚Äù at the Post Office when asked about Henry Staunton‚Äôs departure. The Post Office has been under huge scrutiny since an ITV dramatisation of the scandal over post office operators wrongly convicted of fraud because of the faulty Horizon IT system. Since then, the government has rushed through legislation to compensate those affected more quickly. The government had said Staunton left by mutual consent on Saturday night. Asked whether he had been fired, Badenoch told Sky‚Äôs Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: ‚ÄúYes, we had a conversation and we agreed that it was better that the Post Office had new leadership going forward.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúIt was very sad that we had to come to this conclusion and one of the things that I think is important ‚Äì and one of the things that I think is important when we do need to have a change of personnel ‚Äì is that we don‚Äôt hound the people or go after them. ‚ÄúThe issues that the Post Office have go well beyond the Horizon scandal, so this wasn‚Äôt just about Horizon and the ongoing inquiry into the Post Office. It‚Äôs about the Post Office as an entity and the governance of it. ‚ÄúThere is a board, there have been disagreements across the board, and my view is that sometimes you just need a different person to deal with different issues.‚Äù She said a failure to change the leadership of the Post Office would have been ‚Äúbureaucratic indifference‚Äù and said she had not appointed him in the first place. When asked whether there could be further changes to the board, Badenoch said she was not going to announce HR moves on television. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be making any further comments around personnel changes. I think we need to do this in a civilised way,‚Äù she said. Asked whether she felt ashamed that it took an ITV drama to prompt action, the business secretary said: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt TV that made this happen. It had been happening ‚Ä¶ The drama is not what has been prompting government action.‚Äù Staunton, 75, became chair in December 2022 after a long career in FTSE boardrooms. The decision to replace him came as Rishi Sunak tries to push through new laws to ‚Äúswiftly exonerate and compensate‚Äù those affected by the Horizon scandal. Badenoch said she ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù expects Fujitsu, which provided the faulty Horizon IT system, to pay compensation over the scandal that led to subpostmasters wrongly convicted of fraud. The business secretary said she had written to the chair of the company asking for meetings but he was based in Japan so ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that straightforward‚Äù. She said: ‚ÄúI certainly expect that that will happen in due course ‚Ä¶ Previously we‚Äôve been waiting till the end of the inquiry and it is important that we get to the end of that inquiry to know what should happen. ‚ÄúBut Fujitsu is a part of this, they are very much a part of this story, it‚Äôs not just Post Office management, and I hope that they will do the right thing.‚Äù"

        "content": "Aviation jargon can hide all kinds of horrors. This month Boeing introduced a new phrase to a wider audience ‚Äì Quality escape (n.): part of a 737 Max plane falling off at 14,000ft, producing a deafening roar as the air rushes past passengers fast enough to rip phones from hands and clothing from bodies. It appears that someone in the factory failed to properly fit bolts securing the plug panel for an unused door. For followers of Boeing‚Äôs travails over recent years, the apparent failures in quality control that led to the incident were scarcely believable, less than five years after regulators grounded the 737 Max following two deadly crashes caused by flawed design. Remarkably, no one was seriously injured or killed in the latest incident, which took place on an Alaska Airlines flight on 5 January from Portland, Oregon. But Dave Calhoun, Boeing‚Äôs chief executive, will face intense scrutiny from investors on Wednesday as the company publishes its results for the past year. Once again, the US‚Äôs plane-making champion is facing deep questions about its future. Calhoun quickly accepted the manufacturer had at least partial responsibility for the latest incident ‚Äì in marked contrast to the heavily criticised dithering and diversion by his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, during the previous 737 Max crisis. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator, last week said that it would allow the variant of the 737 Max 9 with the door plug to fly again ‚Äì after demanding checks to the bolts on every plane. Yet the FAA‚Äôs green light came with a major caveat: Boeing would not be allowed to expand production of the 737 Max, its bestselling plane, until the regulator was ‚Äúsatisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved‚Äù. Calhoun will be pushed for guidance on the cost of the resulting delays to deliveries, although he may struggle to give precise numbers.    Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy, said he believed Boeing had ‚Äúunder-resourced production ramp-up‚Äù, leaving too few workers trying to make too many planes. He said that was a symptom of Boeing‚Äôs focus in recent decades on financial performance at the expense of its historical design prowess. The financial focus was most closely associated with Jim McNerney, chief executive for the decade up to 2015. McNerney had learned his trade from Jack Welch, the boss of General Electric (GE). Welch became a household name by pumping up financial performance, only for his legacy to be questioned when GE nearly collapsed during the financial crisis. Calhoun is himself a 26-year GE veteran. Boeing appears to be lining up Stephanie Pope as a potential next leader. But Pope, who was promoted on 1 January to chief operating officer, also comes from a financial rather than engineering background. Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, said Boeing needed new leaders to return its focus to being ‚Äúone of the greatest engineering companies the world has ever seen‚Äù rather than an also-ran that was steadily losing market share to its European rival Airbus. The earlier Max crisis and the pandemic took a heavy financial toll on Boeing, and analysts expect a further $2.1bn (¬£1.6bn) loss before tax for 2023 ‚Äì its fifth year in a row in the red ‚Äì according to forecasts collated by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Boeing is not in danger of going out of business. The company is too big to fail, a behemoth whose travails are large enough to show up in US GDP figures. It could go to investors to ask for more cash. Some analysts say it could even look to sell its defence arm if the needs of the civil aviation business become acute. And the US government would almost certainly act as a backstop if its crises somehow worsened. But failure is not merely a financial measure, as passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight can attest. Cunningham said Boeing needed to generate cash to pay for the eventual development of a new plane to replace the ageing 737 ‚Äì even if Calhoun has said the company will not do so for about a decade. That could be its opportunity to get out of a hole and help it catch up with Airbus, but the latest incident will probably delay that again. ‚ÄúThe issue is the business cycle doesn‚Äôt go on for ever,‚Äù said Cunningham, meaning the industry could go through a fallow period during which orders and cashflow dry up. ‚ÄúBoeing is running out of time.‚Äù"

Henry Staunton was this weekend told by the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, that he will be replaced. Badenoch said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe Post Office is rightfully under a heightened level of scrutiny at this time. With that in mind, I felt there was a need for new leadership, and we have parted ways with mutual consent.‚Äù   Related: No 10 ‚Äòtaking seriously‚Äô reports that Horizon files show Post Office cover-up   Staunton, 75, only became chair in December 2022, after a long career in FTSE boardrooms. The decision to replace him comes as Rishi Sunak tries to push through new laws to ‚Äúswiftly exonerate and compensate‚Äù those affected by the Horizon scandal. ‚ÄúThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation‚Äôs history,‚Äù Sunak told MPs earlier this month. ‚ÄúPeople who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and their reputations destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own. The victims must get justice and compensation.‚Äù More than 700 post office operators were prosecuted by the Post Office after its faulty accounting software, Horizon, made it look as though money had gone missing from their shops. The saga prompted an outcry across the country and was dramatised in the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office earlier this month. There had been several sources of tension between the Post Office chair and the government in recent months, according to a source who spoke to Sky News, which first reported the departure, including a row over the appointment of a new independent director. In a hearing before the Commons‚Äô business and trade committee last June, Staunton was repeatedly questioned by the chair, Darren Jones, about ¬£1.6m in bonus payments that had been made to executives in 2021-22. One of the ways bonuses were awarded depended on the Horizon inquiry; the Post Office admitted it had made mistakes and 33 employees handed back bonuses. The government‚Äôs shareholding in Post Office Limited is managed by UK Government Investments (UKGI), which is also responsible for the public‚Äôs stakes in Channel 4 and the Met Office. The Post Office relies on government funding to operate and has struggled with tough competition in recent years. Staunton previously chaired Phoenix Group, the insurance company, and WH Smith, the high street retailer. His executive career included a stint at ITV, while he held other boardroom seats at companies such as BSkyB and Ladbrokes. A government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúIn a phone call earlier today, the secretary of state for business and trade and Henry Staunton, chair of Post Office Limited (POL), agreed to part ways with mutual consent. ‚ÄúAn interim will be appointed shortly and a recruitment process for a new chair will be launched in due course, in accordance with the governance code for public appointments.‚Äù A Post Office spokesperson said: ‚ÄúOn Saturday afternoon the Post Office was informed that the business and trade secretary had asked Henry Staunton to stand down as chair of the Post Office. We have been advised by the government that they will appoint an interim chair shortly.‚Äù"

Joe Biden has done it for the US. Why not Keir Starmer in the UK? Transforming the economy will come at an outsize cost. Worse, it‚Äôs an escalating cost that is way beyond the public finances of Britain and possibly even the EU. There is money on offer from the private sector: the world is swimming in cash looking for a home. It‚Äôs the demand for super returns that makes a much-needed upgrade of UK infrastructure ‚Äì from hospitals to the electricity grid ‚Äì look¬†unaffordable. Biden is finding this out. His Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is the US‚Äôs main vehicle for spurring a move to lower-carbon energy consumption, works alongside, and overlaps with, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips and Science Act, which boosts the US semiconductor industry, at a cost over 10 years of about $2tn (¬£1.57tn). IRA subsidies and tax breaks on their own, which were originally estimated to cost $385bn, are, according to some analysts, on track to hit $3tn if the US reaches one of the legislation‚Äôs main targets ‚Äì reducing the electricity industry‚Äôs emissions to 25% of its 2022 total. To rival the US effort, the EU has put together the ¬£600bn NextGenerationEU fund to finance the green and digital transitions. It sounds large but is stretched over 27 countries and will need to be supplemented by private funds to achieve its aims. The UK, meanwhile, is taking a piecemeal approach with one-off subsidies that amount to a few billion pounds. Labour‚Äôs ¬£28bn green investment fund is larger ‚Äì if it is not scaled down any further before the election ‚Äì and based on a more coherent industrial strategy, yet still looks puny in a global context. That leaves the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, like all her counterparts in the industrialised world, needing huge amounts of private capital to get investment moving. The subsidies demanded by the owner of British Steel, China‚Äôs Jingye Group, and the Port Talbot steelworks owner Tata to switch from coal to electric furnaces have been eye-watering, and give a taste of what is to come. Green bonds and infrastructure bonds, which generate money for projects that aim to reduce emissions, are seen as a significant funding source, but have proved to be very expensive and the price is likely to stay high, limiting their attraction. Sadiq Khan, London‚Äôs mayor, has flagged a solution that is likely to become increasingly popular in government circles: offering credits in return for green commitments from the private sector. That‚Äôs what the London climate resilience review, authored by former Environment Agency boss Emma Howard Boyd, suggests can be used to generate investment in the capital. In an interim report last week, she suggested offering credits to buyers such as private landlords, local authorities, or utilities companies such as Thames Water, if they undertake work at their own cost to produce ‚Äúa measurable reduction‚Äù in the area of impermeable surfaces that exacerbate flooding. These credits could last ¬≠decades and be used to offset the bad behaviour of the buyer ‚Äì say, the carbon-generating aspects of the business ‚Äì as it seeks to achieve net zero.    The Blair government, realising much of the past wealth had been sold, turned to the future, selling licences to mobile phone ¬≠companies   Carbon credits have been around for some time and are not uncontroversial. The credits are based on markets that critics say price them too cheaply, meaning large industrial firms can afford to buy them and carry on much as before.  Howard Boyd says there are ways to make sure credits connected to infrastructure projects in London would not be abused. She also recommends further research into ‚Äúfinancial models that create markets for investment in nature-based¬†solutions‚Äù. In the 1980s, the UK paid its way by selling ‚Äì at a huge discount ‚Äì dozens of state-owned assets, from North Sea oil and gas rights to British Telecom, BP and British Airways. In the 1990s came the privatisation of the rail network and National Grid. The Blair government, realising much of the past wealth had been sold, turned to the future, ¬≠selling licences (to mobile phone companies) and long-term contracts, such as the ill-fated private finance initiative. There is even less state cash to play with these days if we accept that entrenched political interests prevent reform of the tax system and that state borrowing has limits. It leads politicians of all colours to consider innovative ways to raise finance. Infrastructure credits might work, but they can‚Äôt disguise the huge effort needed ‚Äì expended today or tomorrow ‚Äì to reach net zero."

        "content": "As the adage goes: good things come in small packages. According to alcohol industry experts British consumers are increasingly choosing to enjoy their beverages in smaller portions, but of higher quality ‚Äì fuelling a trend for 100ml taster bottles. The shift comes from a desire to be healthier, experts say, with drinking among UK teenagers and young people falling. In June 2023, Tesco sold 25% more low- and non-alcoholic beer than in dry January. Richard Halstead, the chief operating officer for consumer research at drinks market analysts IWSR, said: ‚ÄúWe are certainly seeing smaller pack formats launched across categories to cater to moderation trends and also financial factors. These smaller sizes lower the cost barriers to entry and encourage the trial of new products or categories.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThe evidence from mainstream wines suggests that consumers see smaller servings (eg cans) of wine generally as convenient, and promote the idea of portion control, but are reluctant to buy them as they often don‚Äôt represent good value compared with a standard bottle.‚Äù Halstead said that with fine wine ‚Äúthis innovative approach makes a lot of sense in terms of the moderation drivers, as wine is a category that due to packaging norms caters less to moderation.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúYou typically either need to be able to share a bottle or be able to finish it within a couple of days. These smaller formats which enable a consumer to have a smaller portion of premium quality products cater to the motivations to drink less, but not compromise on the quality of a product.‚Äù Matt Day, the owner of Daygustation, an independent wine shop and bar in east London, said: ‚ÄúDrinking a whole bottle just doesn‚Äôt fit with the healthy lifestyles of many people these days, yet until now very few decent wines have been available in a small format.‚Äù Day‚Äôs shop has started offering handcrafted and fine wines, apart from sparkling ones, in 100ml ‚Äútaste tubes‚Äù. They can be taken away in the 100ml tubes with prices from ¬£5 for Azevedo Vinho Verde 2022 (a bottle is ¬£14.95). Naked Wines, an online wine retailer, also offers packs of 100ml pouches for its tasting events, sent out by post. This Christmas it also launched its first Advent calendar with samples in it, which sold out within weeks. Marks & Spencer said sales of its small wine bottles (25cl) had increased by 30% year on year, with wine cans showing similar growth over the same period. It sells four different sparkling wines and seven still wines in half bottles. It is not just winemakers going smaller. Cotswolds Distillery has launched a full-strength gin, designed to reduce the amount needed in a gin and tonic. It does this while keeping the strong flavour. Craft beer in 330ml cans is also a top seller. Law changes are also helping, with variations in the sizes of bottles available. In December, the government gave the green light for sstill and sparkling wine to be sold in 200ml, 500ml and 568ml (pint) sizes in 2024, alongside existing measures. Mark Driver, who co-owns the wine business Rathfinny, now sells 50cl sparkling wine bottles. He said: ‚ÄúYoung wine drinkers care about where wine comes from and its quality. They seem to have more interest in the craft, and drink less than the millennials. I am not sure why but perhaps it started with craft beer and gin and has spread to wine.‚Äù It comes after researchers at the University of Cambridge found that taking the largest serving of wine ‚Äì usually 250ml ‚Äì off bar menus could help the nation‚Äôs health and would not hurt pubs‚Äô profits. Ryan Chetiyawardana, a bartender at the Lyaness and Seed Library bars in London, said there had ‚Äúcertainly been a shift from bigger drinks to more balanced ones in a wider sense ‚Äì this has always been part of the cocktail bar world, but it‚Äôs starting to be adopted across the board as more venues focus on the quality of their offerings.‚Äù"

        "content": "A popular Caribbean rum has been rebranded after concerns were raised that its name was associated with slavery. Maison Ferrand, which markets itself as one of the world‚Äôs premier boutique producers of fine spirits, has changed the name of its Plantation rum to Planteray rum. The original name was criticised in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 for its links to the transatlantic slave trade. The change was promised in June 2020 and the company said trademarking the new name in 120 countries had caused delay. The announcement was made by the Maison Ferrand owner, Alexandre Gabriel, at a press conference at the West Indies Rum Distillery in Barbados this month. He said the new name ‚Äúpays homage to sugar cane, the plant that gives birth to the rum, and the sun‚Äôs rays that are essential for sugar cane growth and ripening‚Äù. The announcement did not address the racism complaints made about the original name, and there were no official social media posts about the rebranding. The move was welcomed by Rachelle Ferron, the head of entertainment at ITV‚Äôs Good Morning Britain, who wrote a piece for the Guardian in 2022 in which she cited the brand in a critique of ‚Äúbusinesses [that] still feel the need to use ‚Äòplantation‚Äô as a selling point despite its links to historic colonial exploitation‚Äù. Ferron said: ‚ÄúThis is a welcome advancement, and I am proud that I was integral to this long-overdue change, but there is still work to do and I would urge any company to remove associations with slavery from their branding. This was my own little protest but that‚Äôs how wider change often starts.‚Äù A Maison Ferrand spokesperson said the company would not be commenting further on the rebranding. Announcing the decision to change the drink‚Äôs name in June 2020, Gabriel, the rum‚Äôs creator and master blender, said: ‚ÄúWe understand the hurtful connotation the word ‚Äòplantation‚Äô can evoke to some people, especially in its association with much graver images and dark realities of the past. ‚ÄúWe look to grow in our understanding of these difficult issues and while we don‚Äôt currently have all the details of what our brand name evolution will involve, we want to let everyone know that we are working to make fitting changes.‚Äù In a 2022 interview for the magazine Drinks International, Gabriel said the inspiration for the original name was his childhood in rural France. He said the word plantation was ‚Äúa French farming term‚Äùand the name was chosen ‚Äúwithout any malice and never with any intent to make anyone feel marginalised‚Äù. This is not the first time a rum producer has changed the name of a product because of criticism about an association with slavery. Two years ago, the Danish company 1423 World Class Spirits rebranded its Ron Esclavo rum to Patridom after criticism of the original name, which means slave rum, and the firm‚Äôs claim that it was ‚Äúan homage to the slaves who paid a high price in the history of sugar cane and rum‚Äù. Ferron called on other rum producers to rebrand products linked to slavery. She criticised Diageo for retaining the Captain Morgan brand, named after Sir Henry Morgan, a privateer and plantation owner who owned more than 100 enslaved people. A Diageo spokesperson said: ‚ÄúCaptain Morgan rum was created around 80 years ago and acquired by Diageo in 2001, and there has never been any legal or financial link between the brand and Henry Morgan, who lived in the 17th century.‚Äù"

        "published_date": "2024-01-27T07:45:29+00:00",
        "content": "The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose is considering cutting up to 11,000 staff jobs in the next five years, after the retail group slashed redundancy terms this week. Sources said at least 10% of the staff-owned business‚Äôs 76,000-strong workforce could go across the group‚Äôs head office, supermarkets and department stores. Department heads are working on plans and the number of roles in the business is expected to be gradually reduced over several years via redundancies and not replacing staff who leave, sources said. John Lewis warned about potential job cuts in March last year as part of a plan to reduce costs and use technology to improve efficiency. The group has already cut thousands of jobs partly through store closures, including 16 department stores and several supermarkets, over the past few years. One well-placed source said John Lewis executives had discussed cutting as many as 11,000 roles as part of its latest turnaround plan ‚Äì amid rising pay and other costs and poor sales. Another said this figure had been briefed to select staff by some managers as the company battles to bounce back from a ¬£230m full-year loss. The scale of potential job cuts emerged after the John Lewis Partnership (JLP), which is owned by its staff via a trust, wrote to workers this week telling them it was cutting the terms of its redundancy package in half ‚Äì offering one week of pay a year of service instead of two for anyone being made redundant from 1 February. One member of staff, known as partners because of they co-own the business, said the announcement of a cut was particularly galling as it came shortly after a number of senior executives had left on the more generous deal. JLP told staff it was making the change as the current package was ‚Äúhigher than typical market practice and comes at a very high cost‚Äù. It said it needed to ‚Äúfree up cash‚Äù with a ‚Äúmore affordable‚Äù policy. The company offers the ‚Äúpartnership redundancy pay‚Äù package on top of statutory redundancy pay which is set by the government at one week a year of service for over 22s and 1.5 weeks for those over 41, capped at a maximum of just over ¬£19,000. In an internal memo issued on Thursday, first reported by the Telegraph, the John Lewis Partnership said: ‚ÄúAgainst all of our competing priorities for investment, it‚Äôs fair to say that the high cost of redundancy pay has been one of the things that‚Äôs prevented us from moving as quickly as we‚Äôve wanted to transform ourselves for the future, and has restricted our ability to invest more in pay.‚Äù It added that it was raising the minimum redundancy payment for those who did not qualify for the full partnership package from one week‚Äôs pay to four weeks to ‚Äúbetter support those with shorter service who are affected by redundancy‚Äù. The announcement prompted a flurry of furious posts on the group‚Äôs internal messaging board with one worker saying: ‚ÄúAnother example of major changes being made which will affect partners without a dialogue with partners.‚Äù Some called for an emergency meeting of the group‚Äôs partnership council, which gives the owner-workers a democratic voice via elected representatives from across the business. One member of staff told the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe are held up as a better way of doing business and this just sits uncomfortably particularly when you take into account the recent wave of leadership level [redundancies].‚Äù A spokesperson for JLP said: ‚ÄúWhat we are doing is cost-neutral and it is a rebalancing because any saving on redundancy pay will be directly reinvested into partner pay.‚Äù The news on cutting redundancy terms was sent out via an email and then posted on the company intranet with staff not informed of any discussion at the partnership council. JLP said the issue had been put to the council and the group‚Äôs democratic processes had been followed but the meeting had not been livestreamed to staff."

        "content": "Negotiations over a trade deal between the UK and Canada have been halted after disagreements on beef and cheese tariffs. The ability for the UK to secure its own global free trade deals was sold as one major benefit from the UK‚Äôs decision to leave the EU but progress has been mixed. Here we look at what agreements have been struck so far and with whom, and which other important economies are still at the negotiating table and why.  Trade deals agreed so far Japan When in late 2020 the then international secretary, Liz Truss, signed the UK‚Äôs first major post-Brexit free trade agreement, she said that when it came into force the next year it would boost trade between the two countries by billions of pounds annually.  However, exports to Japan have not quite received the turbo charge promised, falling to ¬£11.9bn in the year to June 2022, from ¬£12.3bn the year before. This included a 4.9% fall in export for goods, to ¬£6.1bn, while services fell 2%, to ¬£5.8bn. Australia The deal in December 2021 was almost entirely focused on goods, with tariffs being eliminated on exports from both countries for a 15-year period. The government said it would unlock ¬£10.4bn of additional trade with the country by the 2030s while ending tariffs on all UK exports. Others were not so positive, with UK farmers angry that Australia had been given full access to sell beef and sheep meat in the UK while there was a ban on beef going the other way. A year later, George Eustice, the former environment minister who was part of the negotiations, said it ‚Äúwas not actually a very good deal for Britain‚Äù and ‚Äúgave away far too much for far too little in return‚Äù. New Zealand This February 2022 deal largely mirrored the Australian one, with similar concerns from UK meat farmers about being undercut by cheaper imports. Tariffs of up to 10% on products were removed from most products, while visa restrictions for travel and residency were eased.  The government estimated that this would add ¬£800m a year to the UK economy by the mid-2030s but the overall impact was negligible, representing just a 0.03% boost to GDP by 2035. The Australian and New Zealand trade deals came into effect in last May. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership While technically not a new trade deal, the UK‚Äôs joining of the CPTPP means a range of export products can be traded tariff-free with the member nations, which include Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada and Mexico but not the US. The deal, agreed last March, also means countries must adhere to certain unified regulations, such as food standards.  However, the CPTPP arrangements can be overridden by individual trade deals with specific countries, which is why the UK is still trying to secure direct deals with member states such as Canada. Analysis has found that exporting to countries in the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019, less than the UK‚Äôs total trade with Germany. The deals still not struck The US Negotiations began in May 2020 and nearly four years later there is no prospect of an agreement any time soon. Last month Joe Biden signalled he had shelved plans for a deal until at least after this November‚Äôs US presidential election. India When negotiations began between India and the UK at the start of 2022, it was hoped that by as early as that October there would be a deal reducing tariffs on exports such as cars and Scottish whisky and providing better access to the world‚Äôs fifth biggest economy. However, we are still waiting, with experts saying any pact is unlikely before the Indian national elections this spring. Others As well as Canada, talks are continuing with other nations including Israel, Mexico and South Korea. The UK began negotiating with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in July 2022. Experts have predicted that a deal with Switzerland, which is the sixth biggest market for the UK to export services to, could be the next reached."

        "content": "Vodafone should be forced to spin off its most sensitive activities in order to quash national security concerns raised by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group swooping on its shares, government officials have told the Guardian. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, announced on Wednesday that the deal involving Emirates Telecommunications Group building a 14.6% stake in Vodafone presented a ‚Äúnational security risk‚Äù to the UK due to Vodafone‚Äôs role ‚Äúas a strategic supplier of services‚Äù to government departments, including those ‚Äúwhich are in support of national security‚Äù. Dowden said on Friday the government had reached an agreement on measures to manage security risks, without giving details. The government ‚Äúhas put in place proportionate measures to address any potential national security concerns‚Äù, he said, adding that the UK was ‚Äúrightly a magnet for global investment‚Äù. However, officials and sources familiar with operations at Vodafone said breaking off some operations would still be safest for the UK. Concern is understood to centre on a division called Vodafone Business Security Enhanced (VBSE). It works on some of the most sensitive tech used by the government and its security agencies, sources told the Guardian, including the Ministry of Defence, Foreign Office, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office. The work is so sensitive that most of VBSE‚Äôs government-linked contracts are not publicly listed and some of its staff are vetted to hold high-level security clearance. The government has not mandated the spin-off of VBSE. However, sources said a full separation might be the best solution to protect the national security functions that VBSE undertakes. A large proportion of VBSE‚Äôs UK workers are based in Hampshire in what the company describes as a ‚Äúmini-Fort Knox‚Äù. Many of its staff have backgrounds in the military, intelligence services or other sensitive areas of government. Its head, Steve Knibbs, who worked at GCHQ for several years after serving in the British military, also chairs the national security committee of the of industry body TechUK. Vodafone‚Äôs work ranges from mobile networks for civil servants to the ownership and maintenance of subsea cables and services for the UK‚Äôs military court service. The service‚Äôs hearings are sometimes highly sensitive, involving risks to national security or military operations, and can be held in private. They can also take place anywhere in the world, requiring secure IT support. Defendants and advocates often appear via video link. The terms of the deal between Vodafone and Emirates Telecoms, also known as e&, allow the latter to add an additional executive to the board if its ownership rises above 20%. It can increase its ownership to nearly 25%. The Cabinet Office said in a statement on Wednesday that the tie-up would allow e& to ‚Äúmaterially influence policy at Vodafone‚Äù. The statement also laid out requirements for Vodafone to set up ‚Äúa national security committee to oversee sensitive work that Vodafone and its group perform which has an impact on or is in respect of the national security of the United Kingdom‚Äù.  Scrutiny has been rising over a range of UK deals backed by the gulf state. This includes the UAE-backed purchase of the Telegraph and Spectator groups. The deal would allow RedBird IMI, which derives most of its funding from Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the UAE and owner of Manchester City football club, to take a controlling stake in the national newspaper and magazine groups. RedBird IMI has said it would be a ‚Äúpassive investor‚Äù once it took ownership of the titles. The Cabinet Office declined to comment. A Vodafone spokesperson said: ‚ÄúVodafone is not considering any change to Vodafone Business Security Enhanced and is not in discussion to spin off the organisation. VBSE is a 24/7 business unit, which has technical operational separation, delivering end-to-end and managed security services to private and public organisations in the UK.‚Äù"

        "content": "Joe Biden has, at least for a while, defused a ticking carbon bomb. Climate activists and the fossil fuel industry are now left wondering how long it will last. The decision on Friday by the Biden administration to pause all pending export licenses for liquified natural gas (LNG) to consider the climate impact of the projects has been hailed as a momentous shift in the status quo by those concerned by the unfolding climate crisis. ‚ÄúWorld leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the Cop28 climate negotiations last year and president Biden‚Äôs decision today to pause new permits for LNG exports shows that he is taking that pledge seriously,‚Äù Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said. From nothing a decade ago, the US now has eight LNG export terminals and is the world‚Äôs largest exporter of the gas, which is extracted, piped, chilled and sent overseas on ships. The pace of growth is extraordinary ‚Äì the Calcasieu Pass 2 (or CP2) project, a vast planned hub on Louisiana‚Äôs coast, would ship up to 24m tons of LNG each year once built and become one of the biggest such terminals in the world.   Related: ExxonMobil‚Äôs attempt to silence activist investors should be a warning to shareholders   CP2 is at the vanguard of a frenzy of new gas export infrastructure along the Gulf of Mexico coast that would, if fully realized, result in an estimated 3.2bn tons of greenhouse gases each year, close to the annual emissions of the entire European Union and severely imperiling hopes of avoiding catastrophic global heating. Stopping CP2 and a dozen or so other proposed gas facilities has become a priority issue for US environmentalists and Biden‚Äôs decision, which should delay projects until after the November presidential election, provoked jubilation. The delay is ‚Äúthe biggest thing a US president has ever done to stand up to the fossil fuel industry‚Äù, according to Bill McKibben, the veteran climate campaigner. Biden has come under severe progressive pressure over the gas buildout, which only heightened after his administration approved the controversial Willow oil project in Alaska. The world cannot afford any new major fossil fuel projects if it is to avoid dangerous global temperature rises, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found. CP2, which would have an emissions impact 20 times larger than that of Willow, has therefore become framed as a test of Biden‚Äôs climate credentials before an election where he will be looking for the votes of those concerned about global heating while also fending off Republican attacks over energy costs and the need to supply European allies with gas in the wake of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Key questions remain unanswered, such as whether the delay is merely a tactic to remove an awkward issue before November or if it will lead to a more lasting reform of federal permitting that explicitly accounts for climate change concerns alongside more nebulous ‚Äúpublic interest‚Äù criteria that haven‚Äôt been updated since the 1980s. US government agencies have, until now, typically disregarded climate as an issue when waving through oil and gas facilities and pipelines. That looks like it may change. ‚ÄúTo preserve a livable planet, we need a public interest test that denies any new project that would drive us further into climate catastrophe and violate US commitments to transition away from fossil fuels,‚Äù said Jean Su, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity‚Äôs energy justice program. Climate considerations should slow but would likely not stop the growth of an LNG export industry that is set to double in size over the next four years, according to Jeff Navin, who was chief of staff at the energy department during Barack Obama‚Äôs administration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not shocking the administration would at least consider the impacts of these projects on climate change and it‚Äôs entirely possibly they could decide they are a net positive for the climate because the gas would displace dirtier coal overseas,‚Äù said Navin, now a consultant. ‚ÄúNot every terminal is going to be stopped. But it‚Äôs going to put pressure on facilities to think about how gas is produced and transported in terms of methane leaks.‚Äù While the delay has been welcomed by climate activists, it will likely prove ammunition for the fossil fuel industry and its Republican allies including Donald Trump, who has vowed to ‚Äúdrill, baby, drill‚Äù and attacked Biden for hindering the industry, even amid a record glut of oil and gas production. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, said that the pause is ‚Äúdirectly at odds with America‚Äôs interests on the world stage‚Äù. A coalition of oil and gas industry groups has written to the Biden administration to complain that the decision will ‚Äúonly bolster Russian influence‚Äù and risk American jobs. Critics, however, point to evidence that boosting LNG exports drives up domestic gas prices for Americans and that the raft of planned terminals would take several years to build anyway, beyond a 2027 timeframe in which European Union countries have vowed to end reliance upon Russian gas and pivot to renewable energy. According to the IEA, European gas demand will fall 8% by 2026. ‚ÄúExpanding LNG infrastructure in the USA and in the EU is a high economic risk that will very likely end up as stranded assets,‚Äù warned Claudia Kemfert, an economic expert at the German Institute for Economic Research and Leuphana University in Germany. For those living amid the tumult of new gas infrastructure along the Gulf coast, the pause is a relief, if a rather tenuous one. The terminals could still be built even with Biden as president, and will almost certainly go ahead if Trump is to win the election. ‚ÄúA pause can be unpaused anytime,‚Äù said Travis Dardar, a fisherman in Louisiana who has campaigned against the LNG expansion in his community. ‚ÄúWe know first-hand how ruthless these gas export companies can be. They shoved these gas export terminals down our throats, destroying our fishing grounds, clogging the channel we use with their massive tankers, and constantly sending poisonous smoke into our air.‚Äù Biden, Dardar said, needs to ‚Äúdeny all gas export terminals, and let this sinking industry fall to the bottom of the sea‚Äù."

Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, said:  The Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation was just released for the month of December 2023 and it keeps alive the chances of a rate cut in March. Core PCE was forecast to show 0.2% growth over the month and it came in in-line with that and means the yearly PCE inflation rate is now 2.9% ‚Äì much closer to the Fed‚Äôs target rate of 2% than it has been at any time over the last three years.‚Äù  Kieran Clancy, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said:  The bigger picture is that core goods inflation is now just above zero, core services inflation is falling and rent inflation is grinding lower, lagging private sector measures of rents for new tenants. The Fed‚Äôs inflation forecasts are stil too high ‚Äì the December [summary of economic projections] shows core PCE inflation running above the 2% target until Q4 2026 ‚Äì and will be revised down again in March, for the third successive quarter, giving the Fed the necessary hook on which to hang the first rate cut, either at that meeting or in May.  In the UK, the car industry has expressed its displeasure at the breakdown in talks with Canada over a trade deal to replace the pre-Brexit EU arrangement. That gave zero tariffs for exports to Canada, but that deal will lapse in April, with little prospect of an agreement before then. The British farming lobby welcomed the continued protections against imports of hormone-fed beef, which is currently illegal in the UK.

Superdry has parted ways with its fourth finance boss in five years as losses widen at the troubled UK fashion brand. The chief executive of the Telegraph has stepped down after seven years as the government prepares to launch a second investigation into public interest concerns raised by the Barclay family‚Äôs complex deal to transfer control of the titles to a UAE-backed consortium. The Conservative peer Michelle Mone and her husband have reportedly had about ¬£75m of assets frozen or restrained by a court order. Shares in US chipmaker Intel slumped after it revealed a weaker forecast of earnings. Germany‚Äôs consumers grew markedly more pessimistic looking ahead to February in a surprise that add further to concerns over a continued recession in the powerhouse of European output.

Next week we have: February! JJ     2.26pm GMT   In Europe the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100 and France‚Äôs Cac 40 have both had strong days. The FTSE 100 has gained 1.5%, or 114 points, to hit its highest since 12 January. Chemicals company Croda and drinks company Diageo have both gained more than 5%. Fashion label Burberry, investment manager St James‚Äôs Place and pest controllers Rentokil Initial rounded up the top five gainers on Friday in London. In France the Cac 40 gained a weighty 2.3% on Friday. It was helped by a 12% jump from LVMH, the conglomerate which owns the Louis Vuitton, Mo√´t & Chandon and Hennessy brands, among many others. LVMH reported a 10% gain in fourth quarter sales, sparking the surge in luxury goods companies that also benefited Burberry and other luxury brands in France including Kering and Herm√®s.     2.12pm GMT   US stock market futures are about flat with 20 minutes to go until the opening bell on Wall Street. The S&P 500, the leading benchmark for large US companies, will gain 0.01% at the open if futures are to be believed, while the Dow Jones industrial average will drop by 0.05%. The Nasdaq tech-focused index is on for a slightly bigger drop of 0.3%.     1.50pm GMT   Will the latest US inflation data be enough to persuade the Federal Reserve that it is time to cut interest rates? Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said:  The December income and spending data confirm that core PCE inflation has been running at an annualised pace in line with the Fed‚Äôs 2% target for seven months now. This reiterates the message that there isn‚Äôt really any ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù of disinflation still to achieve and that, even with real economic growth still resilient, there is plenty of scope for the Fed to start cutting interest rates soon.      1.38pm GMT  US core inflation dropped back in December  The Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure of US inflation dropped slightly to 2.9% in December, almost in line with economists‚Äô predictions. The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index eased from 3.2% to 2.9% in December, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). That was slightly below the 3% expected by economist. The core measure excludes volatile food and energy prices. The standard PCE measure (including food and energy) remained unchanged at 2.6% in December.  BREAKING: December PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, was unchanged at 2.6%, in-line with expectations.Core PCE inflation fell to 2.9%, below expectations of 3.0%.This is the lowest Core PCE inflation number since April 2021.A welcomed sign by the Fed.‚Äî The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 26, 2024      1.27pm GMT   Financial markets are saying it‚Äôs a toss-up over whether the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates at its meeting in March. CME‚Äôs Fedwatch tool shows how market participants are betting on interest rate movements to gauge expectations. The below graph shows that for the March meeting the probability of a cut is seen as 49.3%, against 50.7% for the target range for the federal funds rate to stay on hold at between 5.25% and 5.5%. There is a meeting of the Fed‚Äôs rate-setting federal open markets committee (FOMC) next week as well, but almost nobody believes the Fed will move that abruptly.     1.20pm GMT   Economists and traders are gearing up for one of the key data points of this week: the most closely followed gauge of US inflation. The snappily named core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is the measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve references the most when it is weighing up monetary policy. That means that any surprises can roil financial markets. In November the core PCE inflation fell slightly to 0.1% month-on-month, down from 0.2% in October. The year-on-year reading is expected to dip from 3.2% to 3%, according to a poll of economists. If that easing of inflationary pressure comes to pass, markets could price in more chance of a rate cut in March. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, an investment bank, said the core PCE reading was ‚Äúwidely expected to drop to a level to justify the [Federal Reserve] easing in March at 3%, implying 1.9% six-month average annualized, below their target.‚Äù     1.10pm GMT   The UK car industry has warned that British carmakers face the prospect of tariffs on exports to Canada after bilateral trade talks between the two countries fell through. The British industry is able to sell cars to Canadians without tariffs because the two countries agreed to temporarily extend the privileges the UK had as a member of the EU. However, that tariff-free status is due to lapse in April unless the two countries can reach a bilateral deal. Canada buys 1.3% of UK car exports ‚Äì fewer than 8,000 cars ‚Äì meaning it is only a small sliver of trade dominated by the EU and the US. Nevertheless, the prospect of new tariffs can only hurt those carmakers that sell to Canada. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement to Reuters:  If UK car exports can‚Äôt use EU parts and components to avoid additional duties it creates a risk that tariffs, potentially charged on top of luxury goods taxes, could be reintroduced. Canada is an important market for UK car exports and, given the close ties between our two countries, the suspension of trade talks is especially disappointing and sends a signal that the UK‚Äôs world-class automotive products are not welcome in Canada.      12.55pm GMT   Another technology darling (see Intel earlier) that has had a tricky few days is Tesla. Elon Musk‚Äôs electric carmaker slumped by 12% on Thursday after missing analysts‚Äô expectations for revenues in the final quarter of 2023.   Related: Tesla delivers underwhelming earnings despite Cybertruck launch and high vehicle deliveries   The company has started deliveries of its Cypertruck pickup, and it is planning to make a long-teased mass-market model next year. Musk said he was ‚Äúvery excited‚Äù about the new model:  This is going to be very profound not just in the design of the vehicle itself but also in the design of the manufacturing system.  However, investors focused more on its profit margins, which have been under pressure as competition in the electric car market increases. The price of Tesla shares soared during the coronavirus pandemic as huge monetary stimulus combined with a surge in interest in environmentally friendly technology. Yet even Musk warned that the share price was too high in May 2020, before the valuation broke $1tn in 2021 ‚Äì making it worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined. Tesla‚Äôs shares were worth less than $55 in May 2020, but were worth $182.6 on Thursday evening, giving the company a market capitalisation of $572bn.     12.11pm GMT   The Conservative peer Michelle Mone and her husband have reportedly had about ¬£75m of assets frozen or restrained by a court order. The pair face an investigation by the National Crime Agency into alleged medical equipment fraud. The Financial Times reported that the frozen assets included a six-bedroom central London townhouse, a country estate on the Isle of Man, and 15 accounts with Coutts, C Hoare & Co and Goldman Sachs International. The court order was ‚Äúa result of a consensual process during which negotiations took place with the CPS‚Äù, a spokesperson for Mone and Barrowman told the FT. ‚ÄúIt allows the wider businesses and assets of the Barrowman family to operate normally and free from any restrictions or uncertainties. ‚ÄúDoug and Michelle did not contest the application and were happy to offer up these assets, which means they can begin the task of proving their innocence more quickly.‚Äù You can read the full story here:   Related: Michelle Mone has ¬£75m of assets frozen as NCA investigates fraud        11.57am GMT  Daily Telegraph chief executive steps down ahead of takeover probe  The chief executive of the Telegraph has stepped down after seven years as the government prepares to launch a second investigation into public interest concerns raised by the Barclay family‚Äôs complex deal to transfer control of the titles to a UAE-backed consortium. Nick Hugh, who has run Telegraph Media Group (TMG) since 2017 and was also the boss of parent company Press Acquisitions, has left the company with immediate effect and did not provide a comment in a statement announcing his departure. However, in an internal announcement Hugh, who has driven led the Telegraph‚Äôs drive to more than 1 million print and digital subscribers, said it was an ‚Äúhonour and privilege‚Äù to lead a group of titles that have had ‚Äúsuch an impact on society and democracy‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe interest in the ownership of TMG is testament to that fact,‚Äù said Hugh, who will be replaced by Anna Jones, the former chief executive of the UK publisher of Cosmopolitan, Men‚Äôs Health and Esquire.     11.51am GMT   Shares in US chipmaker Intel have slumped in pre-market trading after it revealed a weaker forecast of earnings. Chipmakers have been flying in recent years as shortages followed by the huge hype over artificial intelligence ‚Äì which is hungry for processing power ‚Äì prompted investors to pile into the sector. Intel was one of the companies that underpinned the rise of the US tech sector to global dominance, but there have been concerns in recent years that it got complacent with its hold on the market for chips in desktop and laptop computers and servers. It largely missed the mobile phone revolution, and much younger rival Nvidia leads in the race to dominate the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. Pat Gelsinger, its chief executive, has launched an ambitious and costly effort to make its own cutting-edge chips once more. Intel‚Äôs shares fell by 12% in pre-market trading on Friday. Lucas Keh, semiconductors analyst at Third Bridge, a research provider, highlighted concerns about its sales of graphics processing units (GPUs) for datacentres, in comments to Reuters:  Although Intel beat estimates, investors‚Äô disappointment in Intel‚Äôs datacentre GPU story‚Äôs growth can be primarily attributed to the slower-than-expected product delivery and ramp-up.  GPUs are often used alongside central processing units (CPUs), giving abilities that are better suited to artificial intelligence.  Updated at 11.53am GMT    11.13am GMT   The UK‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority said it was inviting views on how the Vodafone/Three merger would affect competition by 9 February. The phase 1 investigation would need to be completed by 22 March. The proposed merger has already proved controversial. The Balanced Economy Project, an anti-monopoly campaign group, wrote in the Guardian that it was ‚Äúa classic monopolisation play that will have classic results ‚Äì higher prices, stagnant investment, poor service and job cuts‚Äù.   Related: Vodafone and Three merging would be a disaster ‚Äì not least for your bills | Nicholas Shaxson   The Guardian‚Äôs Nils Pratley pointed out in June that you only get one shot at a ‚Äúfour-to-three‚Äù consolidation ‚Äì nobody is knocking down the door to get into the UK‚Äôs mature ‚Äì i.e., not fast-growing ‚Äì telecoms market. At the moment the four are Vodafone UK, Three UK, BT/EE and Virgin Media O2. Vodafone and Three argue they are far behind the two leaders, earning well below their cost of capital, and that scale would help them to compete more effectively. But Unite, one of the UK‚Äôs largest unions, said it would be ‚Äúa terrible deal for Britain‚Äù. It believes that mobile network prices would go up by as much as ¬£300 per year if the deal goes through.     10.26am GMT  Vodafone UK and Three merger to be investigated by competition regulator  The UK‚Äôs competition regulator has announced a formal investigation into the merger between Vodafone UK and Three that would create the biggest mobile operator in the country. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would look at the potential impact the proposed deal could have on competition for consumers and businesses. The regulator has up to 40 working days for the ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù investigation to test whether the deal may lead to a ‚Äúsubstantial lessening of competition‚Äù. If the CMA thinks that threshold has been met it could order the more in-depth ‚ÄúPhase 2‚Äù investigation. If it still has concerns, the CMA has the power to order changes to the deal, or even block it altogether. Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said:  This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy. The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps. We now have 40 working days to complete this formal Phase 1 investigation, before publishing our findings and any next steps.      9.59am GMT   There is something of a divergence on European stock markets this morning: while German‚Äôs Dax benchmark is still in the negative, down 0.1%, the French and British counterparts are both up by well over 1%. The FTSE 100 in London has gained 1.1%, with Diageo the biggest gainer. The drinks maker was up 3.9% after French rival Remy Cointreau reported increased sales. And in France the Cac 40 index (which does not include Remy Cointreau) gained 1.7%. Part of the gain may be down to Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, as markets increased their bets on rate cuts sooner rather than later after comments by her yesterday. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid wrote:  ECB President Lagarde struck a more dovish tone than expected, which led investors to dial up the chance of a rate cut as soon as April. So with hopes for a soft landing in the ascendancy, and yet more validation for near-term rate cuts, there was a significant cross-asset rally that saw equities and bonds post gains on both sides of the Atlantic.  Germany‚Äôs weak consumer confidence may be one factor holding back the Dax index today, but it is also worth remembering that it is bumping along less than 100 points shy of its all-time record (17,003 points) hit in mid-December. The prospect of rate cuts gets investors excited.     9.25am GMT   European inflation could fall faster than previously expected according to a survey of EU economists ‚Äì the flip side of lower output in the bloc‚Äôs largest economy. A survey by the European Central Bank said that headline inflation under the harmonised index of consumer products inflation was expected to decline from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.0% in both 2025 and 2026. Expectations for 2024 were revised down by 0.3 percentage points and those for 2025 by 0.1 percentage points. The economists pointed to surprise lower inflation readings, lower oil prices and weaker economic activity. GDP growth of 0.6% in 2024, 1.3% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026 was forecasted on average.     9.06am GMT  Drop in German consumer confidence prompts fears for recovery  Germany‚Äôs consumers grew markedly more pessimistic looking ahead to February in a surprise that add further to concerns over a continued recession in the powerhouse of European output. A consumer confidence index fell from a reading of -25.4 to -29.7 in the latest month, according to a survey by GfK which is closely followed by economists. The consensus expectation had been for an increase to -24.5 points. Germany‚Äôs economy is in the doldrums, after output fell in 2023, and many economists expect a two-year recession with high energy costs and faltering industrial demand.   Related: Germany on track for two-year recession as economy shrinks in 2023   Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said:  The plunge in the GfK measure of consumer confidence for February is not what we wanted to see; it casts a shadow over the consumer-led recovery in activity we are expecting at the start of the year. The fall in February more than reverses the increases seen in December and January and leaves the index at its lowest since March 2023.  Consumers‚Äô willingness to save money was its highest since 2008, as they batten down the hatches.     8.28am GMT   The UK and Canada put in place interim arrangements after Brexit to keep trading terms the same while they negotiated. But the collapse in talks means that the relationship is worse than it was while the UK was part of the EU. British cheese exporters will be among the sectors which are hit worst, with steeply rising tariffs. Canada‚Äôs dairy farmers argue that they should not be made worse off by the UK‚Äôs decision to leave the EU. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported:  Representatives from the Dairy Farmers of Canada have argued the UK should be negotiating with the EU to recover its share (15%, based on British population) of the market access Canada handed over to foreign competitors under [trade deal] CETA. ‚ÄúHow is this the Canadian government‚Äôs problem to solve?‚Äù wrote Jacques Lefebvre, DFC‚Äôs CEO, in an email to CBC News.      8.15am GMT   European stock markets have opened with a mixed picture across the continent, although the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100 has jumped. Here are the opening snaps from Reuters:  EUROPE‚ÄôS STOXX 600 UP 0.2% BRITAIN‚ÄôS FTSE 100 UP 0.7% FRANCE‚ÄôS CAC 40 UP 0.5%, SPAIN‚ÄôS IBEX UP 0.2% EURO STOXX INDEX UP 0.1%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS UP 0.1% GERMANY‚ÄôS DAX DOWN 0.1%      8.12am GMT  British farming lobby welcomes end of Canada trade talks  The end of trade talks between the UK and Canada is a ‚Äúrelief for farmers‚Äù, the head of the British National Farmers‚Äô Union (NFU) has said. Agricultural products represent a tiny proportion of output in the UK and Canada. Only 0.8% of UK GDP in 2022 and 1.7% of Canada in 2019 was from agriculture, forestry and fishing, according to the World Bank. However, the position of farmers is often a totemic issue in trade talks. ‚ÄúCanadians love British cheese‚Äù but they ‚Äúhave been determined to do a contra‚Äù to get hormone-treated beef and certain pork products into the UK, Batters said. She said:  Trade on agricultural products is always the first thing to be discussed and the last thing to be agreed, and I‚Äôm pleased the government has stuck to its line and not given way. Canada has played hard ball for a long time and it was always going to come to a crunch point.  Batters said compromise would have damaged the UK farming sector by producing a ‚Äútwo-tier‚Äù industry, with British farmers competing with Canadian farms with lower standards. The below chart from the World Bank shows how the proportion of economic output accounted for by farming in the world has fallen markedly since the 1980s across the world.   Updated at 8.24am GMT    7.55am GMT  UK-Canada trade talks break down in beef over cheese  The UK has walked away from post-Brexit trade talks with Canada in what one expert described as a ‚Äúblow to the government‚Äôs trade story‚Äù. Canada said the breakdown in talks came because the UK insisted on maintaining restrictions on its agricultural products, of which beef treated with hormones has been a persistent problem. The BBC on Friday reported that the beef dispute was a key factor in the failure of talks. British cars will also face tariffs from the end of April when imported to Canada. Canada had already imposed a 245% tariff at the start of the year on British cheeses such as stilton and cheddar if they fell outside the already existing quota for non-EU imports. In a statement posted on X, a British government spokesperson said ‚Äúwe reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made‚Äù.   Related: UK suspends trade talks with Canada after claims that ‚Äòprogress is not being made‚Äô   A spokesperson for Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said:  We are disappointed that negotiations with the UK are being paused. Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.  Ng‚Äôs UK counterpart, Kemi Badenoch, did not appear to have commented on the breakdown in talks by Friday morning. Badenoch has been seen as a contender for the Conservative party leadership if Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is pushed aside, in part because of her work on trade deals. David Henig, UK director for the European Centre For International Political Economy, a trade-focused thinktank, said it was ‚Äúlittle surprise‚Äù that the UK had failed to reach a deal with ‚Äúpersistently tough negotiating partners‚Äù. He added it was ‚Äúa blow to the government‚Äôs trade story.‚Äù  UK trade news! Canada have proved persistently tough negotiating partners for the UK, and this comes as little surprise. The existing replica of the EU agreement is presumed to hold for now, but must also raise a question on CPTPP ratification. https://t.co/NtPzeLf5ZY‚Äî David Henig üá∫üá¶ (@DavidHenigUK) January 25, 2024  The agenda 9am GMT: European Central Bank survey of professional forecasters 1:30pm GMT: US core personal consumption expenditure inflation price index (previous: 0.1%; consensus: 0.2%)  "
