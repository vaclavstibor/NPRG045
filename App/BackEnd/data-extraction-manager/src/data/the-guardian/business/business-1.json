        "content": "One of the consistent themes of the Conservative economic narrative is an admiration for the US and its ability to grow quickly. The way it has bounced back from the pandemic and how it has ridden out the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should serve as a blueprint. A neoliberal Conservative analysis puts the emphasis on tech, innovation and a myth-like entrepreneurial spirit that the UK would do well to emulate. What it ignores is the way the US economy zips ahead on fantastical stock market valuations and off-balance-sheet accounting reminiscent of the years before the 2008 financial crisis. And how both these habits could bite back in a big way, much as they did in 2008, and pretty soon. While Europe wrestles in a largely transparent fashion with the fallout of deindustrialisation and an ageing workforce with high levels of welfare and state subsidies (giving rightwing commentators all the ammunition they need to knock slow-moving social democratic societies), the US hides many of its problems. One of those costs is a looming insurance crisis chronicled by analysts at Bloomberg. It is an off-balance-sheet exercise that ranks alongside student loans and public service pensions for its sheer size, but outranks them for the nightmarish instability of the whole scheme. The financial data provider has documented the switch by millions of homeowners from private insurers to a “last resort” state-run insurer in areas affected by the climate crisis and the hurricanes, wildfires and floods that rising temperatures bring. Those plans have more than doubled their market share since 2018, and their liabilities crossed the $1tn threshold for the first time in 2022, according to Property Insurance Plans Service Office, a research company that tracks the programmes. Critics of the way private insurers have offloaded liabilities worry that even a modest wave of claims in any of these states will overwhelm the finances of the scheme. Still, one could argue that when this happens, it will be the US government that picks up the tab, keeping a bad problem relatively self-contained. A looming banking crisis may not be so easy to stop at the border. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that US banks were at risk from the impact of high interest rates on the value of commercial property.   Related: Could office blocks be the next big casualty of the banking crisis?   Office blocks that have seen their value soar in the last 15 years are now seriously underwater, financially speaking. Analysts have been worried for some time about the huge liabilities on bank balance sheets, but the lack of demand for office space, as a result of the trend for working from home, means a crisis is now imminent. We all remember how the sub-prime residential property markets of California, Florida and many other US states became a bubble after several years of aggressive mortgage selling to people with low incomes. It burst, triggering the 2008 financial crisis, after a series of interest rate rises meant the mortgages were unaffordable and owners handed back the keys. The IMF said a “sizable subgroup” of banks were in trouble, “with fears that the failure of one institution could precipitate a broader loss of confidence in the sector”. It added: “Beyond the unrealised losses due to higher interest, the credit risk carried by some institutions, particularly their exposure to corporate real estate, is at the centre stage of investors’ fears today.” Staff at the credit rating agency S&P have also signalled concerns about high interest rates, though they make a separate point, saying rising debt bills could trigger a wave of corporate failures in the US next year. At a recent briefing, some of the agency’s analysts said thousands of companies had hedged their interest rate exposure, betting that they could refinance when rates fell back. What if rates only tick down gently? These companies will find their loans unaffordable and go bust. Central bank governors in the US, eurozone and UK are expected to cut the cost of borrowing slowly this year. Possibly too slowly. Another concern is the exuberance seen in US stock markets. Could it be that increases in share values over the last two years, pushing the US S&P 500 to a record high, constitute a speculative bubble and a rout is imminent? A great admirer of the US, Rishi Sunak appears to believe the UK would be well placed sitting in Washington’s slipstream. That means loosening the constraints on financial companies and banks, letting them join the dash for profit, while running down the capacity of public services, including health. It also means becoming more dependent on foreign investment and imports of essential goods from countries that have lax health and safety laws, weaker workers’ rights and more autocratic or unstable governments. Whatever kind of potential shock you care to think about – health, financial or trade – the UK is becoming more, not less, vulnerable. "

        "content": "It is well over a decade since John Lewis staff last gathered in its cavernous Oxford Street store to cheer the announcement of a bumper annual bonus. Workers could be forgiven for booing instead this week if, as expected, the company announces the third missed bonus in four years. The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose is expected to announce that it has bounced back into the black when it unveils annual results on Thursday – but workers are unlikely to see a payout. The staff-owned company, whose 34 department stores and 329 supermarkets employ 74,000 people, is struggling to compete with a revived Marks & Spencer, Boots and Sainsbury’s as well as fast-growing, newer businesses such as Dunelm, Amazon and Home Bargains. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, expects the John Lewis Partnership to report an underlying profit of about £25m, after a loss of more than £77m last year. He predicts a 2% increase in sales to almost £10.8bn after Waitrose returned to growth, partly thanks to food price inflation. He thinks sales at Waitrose rose by about 4% in the second half, which includes Christmas, but sales at the department stores are likely to have fallen by more than 2%.   The group still has too many stores and too much space  Nick Bubb, retail analyst    The group has just announced the biggest increase in basic pay in its history, but is also banking the effects of some tough cost-cutting measures at head office, with more than 1,500 job cuts and the closure of unprofitable stores. Up to 11,000 more job cuts are expected in the coming years, but no further details on that are anticipated this week. Bubb says: “The markets they are in were pretty good two years ago but now they have obviously reversed.” The group still has “too many stores and too much space” and “until they really confront that issue it is going to be tough”. Outgoing chairman Sharon White, who clocked in just before the pandemic and is set to leave early next year, will hope the return to profit marks the beginning of an upturn so she can depart on a high. Under her, the group has taken some tough and necessary decisions: closing eight department stores and several supermarkets as well as shrinking the head office team and moving out of its expensive London headquarters. She has been criticised for focusing on projects such as building homes to rent and expanding financial services while the core retail business drifted. Both Waitrose and the department stores have been losing market share: they failed to take full advantage of Debenhams’ demise and lost out to cheaper rivals when the cost of living crisis hit. John Lewis stores appear to have lost focus in the past year, with the Anyday cut-price brand, launched to much fanfare in 2021, less visible. There is also no sign of a renewed loyalty programme or marketing gambit that is a viable alternative to the Never Knowingly Undersold promise which was ditched in 2022. Zoe Mills of market research firm GlobalData said: “When Anyday launched, it had big areas that were very focused, with industrial orange. In homewares it is now just a few lines mixed in. It feels like it has not been executed consistently.” It’s not clear who could fill White’s shoes. Much-fancied replacement Katie Bickerstaffe, co-chief executive of M&S, appeared to rule herself out last week when she announced she was quitting for a “portfolio career”. Other contenders are thought to include the former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King, although he recently took a job as chairman of energy group Ovo; Mike Coupe, who succeeded King at Sainsbury’s and is on the board of fashion chain New Look; and former Co-op chair and Selfridges deputy chairman Allan Leighton.  The recent hire of well-respected former John Lewis staffer Peter Ruis to head up the department stores has been well received. Now in place for almost two months, Ruis is likely to provide the first taste of his plans for the retailer this week. It’s not clear whether he will have access to a budget that might help enliven stores. John Lewis’s department stores have survived where rivals Debenhams and Beales have virtually disappeared from the high street, while House of Fraser has shrunk to 29 stores, half its size when it was bought out of administration in 2018. Nonetheless, with household budgets still under pressure, even for well-heeled shoppers, the group has plenty to do before workers can celebrate a bonus again."

        "content": "“It has been one thing after another since Covid,” says Mandy Yin as she looks over the accounts for her small north London independent restaurant. It’s just before lunchtime on a Friday and Sambal Shiok’s chef is busy chopping ingredients for chicken and prawn laksa, the signature dish at the eatery on Holloway Road, a busy thoroughfare not far from Arsenal’s Emirates stadium.  Fuluke Barca, the head chef at Sambal Shiok, prepares the kitchen and the ingredients for the day’s business; the prawns and chicken for the laksa; the rice noodles are cooked for the vegan laksa.  The 36-seat eatery specialising in laksa, a spicy noodle dish, has benefited from diners heading on to matches at the Premier League football club, as well as locals returning to office work and popping out for lunch again. Sales are back to pre-Covid levels, but that comes after price rises and an extra day of opening as the cost of living crisis and roadworks that block part of the pavement outside have an impact. “People are coming out less often. Regulars used to come in once a week, now it’s maybe once a month,” Yin says. Profits are under pressure as costs have risen considerably – on ingredients, pay, rent, energy bills and even legal costs as she is having to apply for visas for some of her staff. Yin now charges £20 for the chicken and prawn laksa, up from £13.80 in 2020. She says customers question the price rises, but argues she has no choice if the business is going to survive. Sambiol Shiok makes just 80p profit on that signature dish after its exotic ingredients, energy bills and staff costs are taken into account. Today, £4 – or 20% – of the price diners pay goes straight to the government in VAT after a tax break for hospitality businesses introduced during the pandemic came to an end in April 2022. The biggest rise in bills, however, comes from energy. Pre-pandemic, the restaurant would pay between £600 and £800 a month on gas and electricity. “Now it can be up to £1,800 and there is not much I can do about it,” says Yin. Rent is also up – by about 10% – but there is relief that the restaurant qualifies for 75% relief on business rates.  Barca transfers the chicken and prawns into a bowl.   The sauce is served into the bowl of chicken and prawn laksa.  Sambal Shiok’s total wage bill has not risen significantly, but that is mainly because the restaurant now employs fewer people as the wage per person has risen by more than 30% in the past few years – as demand for chefs has made it hard to find skilled staff while the legal minimum wage has also stepped up significantly. There is no more room for cuts, however. The meal is labour-intensive because, for example, Sambal Shiok makes its own laksa paste. “If anyone has tried making it they will realise it has an ingredients list as long as your arm,” says Yin, including two types of chilli, shrimp paste and dried prawns – all fried off 24 hours in advance to let the flavours develop.  Chicken and prawn special laksa, and right, the vegan special laksa.  Ingredients for the laksa cost between £3.50 and £5, up 30% on 2019. Staff costs are more than £6 a bowl, while rent, energy bills and other administration costs add almost £4. The broth includes tamarind and lemongrass, which have risen in price, contributing to a more than doubling of the cost of ingredients since 2019. The price of coconut milk, chillis and prawns is up about 50%, while oil has doubled in cost.  Customers enjoy a bowl of laksa.  While some ingredient prices are now coming down, that will not offset the next increase in wages in April as the government raises the legal minimum hourly wage for those 21 and over to £11.44, a near-10% increase on current rates. “Prices will have to go up again by 10%. If I don’t do that I will go bust and the whole team will lose their jobs,” Yin says. “It’s a constant balance to try and make it value for money for the customer and not put people off by the price.” Other costs she did not face in 2019 are also looming. Yin took out a government-backed bounceback loan to help pay her rent during the pandemic. Now the business has to bear a £500 payment every month for the next decade.  Mandy Yin in front of her restaurant.  With the minimum salary requirement for specialist work visas required by some of her experienced staff who are not UK citizens rising from £26,200 to an unaffordable £38,700 from April, Yin faces a race against time and costs of more than £2,000 for each applicant to become a sponsor and then secure a visa. Workers have to pay thousands more for the right to stay in the UK, including more than £1,000 a year for access to the NHS. Yin does not pay herself a salary or work directly at the restaurant any more. During the height of Covid she realised she had to diversify her income, getting a book deal and doing writing, some TV and other media work. She adds: “Pre-Covid I used to think about growing the business. Now my only focus is staying open – survival.” Ditto Coffee The surge in costs at Ditto Coffee is marked out clearly on one of its full English breakfast plates. A year ago you could count on three sausages and three rashers of bacon – now you get two of each. “It used to be gargantuan, and it’s still really big, but we’ve had to make some menu changes,” says Natasha Murphy, the director of the independent chain, which has four outlets in Manchester and Liverpool. “If something is becoming really an issue or it is not in season then it is out,” says Murphy, sitting in its flagship Ditto Coffee Union outlet in central Manchester near the town hall, which has space inside for 40 diners and 10 more outside.  Natasha Murphy, the director of Ditto Coffee, talking to the chef about new spring menu options.  The coffee shop has benefited from having “a bit of a captive audience” as it makes up the ground floor of an office block that is home to a property company, but it has also been drumming up trade with live music and other special events. “You have got to have a USP, something that sets you apart,” says Murphy. She adds that trading was probably tougher last year, and the business is benefiting from more workers in the surrounding buildings heading back into the office more frequently. “The main thing we are up against is the electricity bill. I wonder even if the wholesale price does come down will that translate to us customers? It’s all smoke and mirrors,” she says.  Breakfast, with all the trimmings.  She says the bill for the flagship outlet soared by roughly 150% to about £2,000 a month in two years. “It’s stark when you look at it on paper. We need government intervention. There is a cap for residential [bills] and that’s what I would really welcome to see from the government [for businesses].”  Serving up the coffee.  Business rates are another problem. “We got support for rates during lockdown and that did help immensely but it went from all to nothing,” says Murphy. “A lot of independent businesses are closing as they can’t afford it.”  Customers sit outside at Ditto Coffee.  There has also been a battle to afford wages, amid heavy competition for staff which meant one head chef left as the cafe could not afford to match the rate he was offered elsewhere. The cafe operates with four or five staff and tries to be efficient by, for example, taking orders at the till rather than at tables, but Murphy adds: “We are providing a restaurant quality bunch. We need to have that [many staff] as any less we wouldn’t operate properly.”  A barista at work at Ditto Coffee.   A coffee and a vegan croissant.  She notes that while in 2018 the minimum wage for someone over 21 was £7.83, now it is £11.24 – a 43% rise. With an increase in the wage bill, some ingredients and energy bills, prices have had to go up. However, the chain has responded by making different pricing changes depending on the outlet. “Generally people have been supportive. If you’re in an affluent area where people have got money to spend they are not going to look at 10p or 20p on the menu, Murphy says. “It is worse in Liverpool’s Baltic Triangle as our clients there tend to be students and artists and to them that can make a lot of difference.”"

        "content": "German Deli in east London is known for its wide variety of traditional sausages, but the post-Brexit border changes brought in last month means stocks are running worryingly low. Offering 22 types of fresh sausage, from the classic Bavarian leberwurst to the Oktoberfest currywurst, the online retailer has become popular with expats and lovers of German cuisine since it launched in 2004. But the company’s accounts manager, Susann Schmieder, says: “We only have stuff left over from before the new border changes came in, and those are approaching their best before dates.” It has not received a delivery of sausages at its warehouse in Walthamstow since 31 January, when the government brought in the first stage of its border target operating model (BTOM), which requires a vet to sign off all meat and dairy imports before they can be shipped. “The issue is our supplier is still waiting for feedback from their local food and veterinary office on which papers and checks they need,” Schmieder said.  German Deli is far from alone. Other UK delis are struggling to stock some of their staple goods as their European suppliers wrestle with new the post-Brexit import rules. One in London that stocks products from across the continent expects a dozen of its providers to stop exporting to the UK because of the new red tape. Another, ScandiKitchen, also in London, has stopped stocking 20 items, largely sausages and pates, because of confusion about what was required Its managing director, Jonas Aurell, who has run the business since 2006, said: “Our main suppliers are struggling to get all the paperwork together and getting their head around it. We’re looking for other suppliers to fill the gap.” Another key supplier had abandoned the UK completely because it did not have the resources to cope with the paperwork, instead focusing on its domestic market, he said. Schmieder, who says she has lost sleep over the situation, said German authorities were still unsure of what exactly UK government required. “When I rang the UK government to ask what our supplier needed to do, it said I had to get in contact with our local veterinary office in Germany. It’s completely stupid,” she said. Even if her supplier does get through the certificate impasse, it has said it will probably have to cut the number of sausage types it supplies from 16 to just four, because of the cost and time associated with obtaining the health certificates. Major disruption at the border has been averted so far by the government taking a light-touch approach to the checking paperwork, but it will introduce new border checks on 30 April that will involve astricter regime for those that do not have correct documentation. David Josephs, the chief executive of Panzer’s Delicatessen in St John’s Wood, north London, said the latest requirements were just adding another layer of red tape for businesses trying to bring in products from Europe. “The addition of this paperwork, on top of what has come before, has led to lots of suppliers saying, ‘No way. We’re not doing this any more, it’s just not worth it,’” he said. Since the country left the EU single market, 37 of his regular suppliers had stopped exporting to the UK, he said. He expects a dozen more will probably opt out as a result of the new rules. Andreas Gheorgiou, the managing director of Andreas in Chelsea, London, said the health certificates meant it was harder to get meat products such as chicken and pork, and he expected more problems to come from his most remote suppliers. “If the supplier is in the middle of the Tuscan mountains, finding an actual vet to do it, and do it to the standard it needs to be done, would be hard,” he added. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The new necessary border controls follow extensive consultation with industry and will be introduced progressively to protect the UK’s biosecurity from potentially harmful pests and diseases while maintaining trust in our exports. “We are confident that our border control posts will have sufficient capacity and capability to handle the volume and type of expected checks, while we have engaged closely with EU member states to ensure they are prepared for these changes and have so far expressed a high level of confidence in their ability to meet this.”"

        "content": "The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, will run for a second five-year term after being nominated by a string of European countries to lead the global lender. The Bulgarian economist and champion of policies to tackle the climate crisis will be given the support of her home country, which said she had accepted the nomination for another term starting in September. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said at a G20 summit meeting last weekend that Georgieva had done a “great job” leading the institution and that France would support her for a second term. Dimitar Radev, the central bank governor of Bulgaria, said she had earned the “great respect and trust” of the IMF’s member countries during her first five years at the Washington-based organisation. Finance ministers from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands are expected to join Bulgaria and France in backing Georgieva. The support of European countries, which is expected to include the UK, will prove crucial to her re-election, given that European countries traditionally nominate a candidate to lead the IMF, though all European Union members must agree. The final decision is made by the institution’s board of directors.Georgieva, who will be 71 in August, was the World Bank’s chief executive from 2017 before taking the IMF’s top job in October 2019. She was almost forced out in 2021 after she was accused of being involved in doctoring data during her tenure at the World Bank. She denied any wrongdoing and was later cleared, but only after the IMF board had met seven times to consider the case against her. Keeping Georgieva on for a second term would help answer longstanding concerns raised by emerging market and developing countries about the US-western European duopoly at the two global financial institutions, the IMF and World Bank. Georgieva is the second woman to head the IMF and the first person from an emerging market economy. She has faced criticism for failing to end the cycle of debt and high interest rates that limit the prospects for growth across much of the developing world. Critics argue that debt relief and financial bailouts are often tied to programmes of privatisation and tax rises that cause social upheaval. Georgieva has said she has overseen $305bn (£238bn) of lending to emerging market economies and a fivefold increase in interest-free loans to developing economies. A self-described “eternal optimist”, Georgieva has made tough comments on member countries, including the UK government’s financial planning, and especially the recent emphasis by the Conservative administration on tax cuts at the expense of rebuilding the economy’s resilience to future shocks and reducing debts. Radev said: “Under her leadership, the IMF has supported the global economy with large-scale financing for nearly 100 member countries as they dealt with the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. “Many of my colleagues, the governors of the IMF, would like to see her continue as the managing director of the institution for a second mandate.” He said consultations would continue with European partners on a common view about a potential nomination."

        "content": "Employers added 275,000 jobs across the US last month, as the labor market continues to grow at a clip in the face of the high interest rates. Job growth exceeded expectations of 200,000 on Wall Street in February and rose from the previous month’s revised rate of 229,000. Unemployment stood at 3.9%, according to data released on Friday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a 0.2% increase compared to January. The unemployment rate has now been under 4% for 25 consecutive months, the longest such streak since the 1960s. Industries that saw an increase in jobs include healthcare, government employment and food services and drinking places. While jobs continue to be added each month, activity in the labor market has cooled. The change in employment for December was revised down by 43,000, from 333,000 to 290,000, and January was revised down by 124,000, from 353,000 to 229,000. Job openings and the number of workers quitting their jobs fell slightly in January, according to official data released earlier this week. The number of workers who resigned from their jobs in January, at 3.385 million, was the lowest since January 2021. Layoffs have, meanwhile, climbed sharply. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported yesterday that layoffs last month were the highest of any February since 2009, at 84,658: up 3% on the month and 9% on the year. But jobs growth has remained robust. Private sector payrolls increased by 140,000 last month, according to report from payrolls firm ADP, an increase on January. “Job gains remain solid. Pay gains are trending lower but are still above inflation,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “The labor market is dynamic, but doesn’t tip the scales in terms of a Fed rate decision this year.” Economists have been closely watching jobs and inflation figures as the Federal Reserve tries to guide the economy towards a so-called “soft landing”, where price growth is normalized and a recession is avoided. Two years ago the Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to bring down inflation. It peaked at 9% in June 2022, and has since retreated to 3.1% in January. The Fed, which wants inflation to fall to 2%, increased interest rates 11 times to between 5.25 and 5.5% – the highest in over 20 years – as it battled to bring it down. Officials at the central bank are “not looking for better inflation readings than we’ve had”, its chair, Jerome Powell, told Congress this week. “We’re just looking for more of them.” Powell also implied that the Fed will hold interest rates steady until at least the summer, shutting down any expectation that officials would cut rates anytime soon. Powell told Congress that he has “no reason to think” that the US is in immediate danger of entering a recession. When jobs figures came in higher than expected last month, Joe Biden said that “America’s economy is the strongest in the world”. In his annual State of the Union address Thursday night, the president struck a similar tone, promising that the “landing is and will be soft”. “I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation’s history,” Biden said. “It doesn’t make news, but in a thousand cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.”"

In other news, Crispin Odey has been accused of rape in a civil lawsuit in the latest and most serious claim to be made against the prominent City financier. The allegation came to light on Thursday when the high court in London heard an application to decide whether three women could join two others in a legal action alleging misconduct by the founder of Odey Asset Management. Odey, who left OAM last year amid allegations that he sexually assaulted or harassed a number of women, has previously denied any misconduct.

Frasers said it was not willing to fund a turnaround after the business had “consistently missed its business plan targets” and made losses. Specialising in luxury labels, from Gucci to Dr Martens, online and through three London stores, Matches generates most of its revenue internationally, delivering to 150 countries outside the UK.

Have a fab weekend – we’ll be back on Monday. Bye! – JK  Updated at 3.19pm GMT    3.04pm GMT  Duvel halts production after cyber attack  A cyber attack has forced the Belgian beer company Duvel to halt production at four breweries in Belgium and a site in Kansas City in Missouri. The company said the suspected ransomware attack happened on Tuesday night. Five of its production facilities were shut down initially but one is back up and running, in Puurs-Sint-Amands. Duvel said it was currently unable to give further details  as the investigation into the cause of the cyber-attack is ongoing.” The built-in command systems and alarms in the IT-system worked well, so our IT department was immediately informed of the attack. The servers were immediately shut down, which also shut down production at the four Belgian production sites and the production site in Kansas City.  Beer drinkers need not fret, though. A spokesperson told local media:  We have more than enough beer in stock to cover this production stop.  The company brews the well-known Duvel in Breendonk, along with Vedett and Maredsous beers. Its other sites are in Oudenaarde (Liefmans), Antwerp (De Koninck) and Achouffe (La Chouffe). In a ransomware attack, hackers threaten to block or leak files unless they are paid.  Updated at 3.08pm GMT    2.00pm GMT   Labour market conditions are easing despite employment strength, said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics, said:  The 275,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in February may, at face value, add weight to the Fed’s view that there is no rush to start cutting interest rates, but the downward revisions to previous months’ gains leave recent growth looking less strong than previously thought. Alongside the rise in the unemployment rate to a two-year high and a much weaker rise in wages, there is less reason now to be concerned that renewed labour market strength will drive inflation higher again. The headline gain wasn’t far from our above-consensus 250,000 forecast and partly reflects the unwinding of January’s weather-related distortion. Although payrolls weren’t obviously hit in January, the cold snap at the start of the month left an unusually high number of people unable to work because of the weather. The return of those workers in February helped boost the headline payrolls figure, and may explain the stronger gains in sectors like construction, retail and in particular food services.  In a further sign of weakness, the household measure of employment fell again, by 184,000, pushing the unemployment rate up from 3.7% to 3.9%, its highest since January 2022. The rise in the unemployment rate was also partly due to a solid 150,000 increase in the labour force, which should provide a bit more confidence to Fed officials that the supply-side’s strong performance over the past year continues. Average weekly hours worked, which had been hit by the early-January cold, rebounded last month to 34.3. And because that January weakness was concentrated in low-wage sectors, that rebound also explains why average hourly earnings rose by a muted 0.1% m/m, in line with our own forecast. Although the annual growth rate only edged down to 4.3%, the decline in the job quits rate to below its pre-pandemic level suggests wage growth will slow a lot further over the coming months.      1.45pm GMT  US jobless rate uptick, slowing wage growth boost hopes of rate cuts  An uptick in the US unemployment rate and slowing wage growth have boosted expectations that the US Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates sometime this summer. The unemployment rate rose to 3.9%, the highest since January 2022, against expectations that it would stay at 3.7%, while average hourly earnings rose 0.1% in February from January, less than the 0.3% growth forecast by economists. The data from the US Labor Department also showed the economy added 275,000 jobs last month, more than the expected 200,000. However, that strong reading was partly offset by big downward revisions to December and January’s gains, with the latter now at only 229,000, a big reduction from the initial estimate of 353,000. European stocks, government bonds and the euro rose after the data, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which is trading 0.3% or 24 points lower.  Updated at 3.17pm GMT    12.59pm GMT  HelloFresh shares plunge after profit warning  Shares in HelloFresh plunged more than 40% today after it warned that annual profits will fall short of expectations. The German meal-kit company said it now expects to post earnings of between €350m (£298m) and €400m this year, down from the €568m analysts had forecast. The share price fell 42% to €6.84. Berlin-based HelloFresh also ditched its revenue and profit targets for next year because of higher costs in the development of its “ready to eat” division. The warning comes after the recipe box firm was fined £140,000 by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office for sending millions of spam emails and texts to customers. Along with rivals such as Gousto and Mindful Chef, the company benefited from booming demand during the Covid-19 pandemic when people were stuck at home. But customer numbers dropped off after restrictions were removed, and as the cost of living crisis forced many people to tighten their belts. HelloFresh, which was founded in 2011 and inspired by a Swedish startup called Linas Matkasse, delivers boxes with recipe cards and ingredients for Instagram-worthy home-cooked meals, such as balsamic steak with red cabbage and potato wedges (“no shopping, no planning”).     12.01pm GMT  IMF head Kristalina Georgieva to run for second term  The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, has announced that she is running for a second term as fund’s managing director. A Bulgarian economist, aged 70, she has run the fund since 2019, and has already received the backing of the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire for a second term. The campaign has been kicked off by the Bulgarian central bank governor Dimitar Radev, who said:  Kristalina Georgieva has earned the great respect and trust of the IMF’s member countries during the years of her mandate as the fund’s managing director. Under her leadership, the IMF has supported the global economy with large scale financing nearly 100 member countries as they dealt with the COVID pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis. Many of my colleagues, the governors of the IMF, would like to see her continue as the managing director of the institution for a second mandate – a view also expressed by France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire at the time of the of the recent G20 meeting in Sao Paolo. Consultations will continue with our European partners on a common view about a potential nomination in accordance with the IMF’s process of selection of the MD of the institution.  Under Georgieva, the IMF has deployed $1 trillion in reserves and liquidity since the Covid-19 pandemic. It lent $35bn to 40 emerging market countries and presided over a five-fold increase in interest-free lending to 56 low-income countries. The fund also agreed $1bn in debt relief for the poorest countries after the pandemic. The fund has adopted its first ever climate strategy, and has raised $42bn so far for the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which helps vulnerable emerging and low-income countries cope with climate change and pandemics.     11.17am GMT   The UK’s High Pay Centre has described the £8m pay package for BP’s chief executive as “a damning indictment of an economic model which is failing consumers and the planet” – at a time when millions of households in the UK are in fuel poverty. Andrew Speke, spokesperson for the think tank, which is focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said:   This huge pay award for BP’s CEO is a damning indictment of an economic model which is failing both consumers and the planet. While households in the UK have faced rocketing bills, which have plunged millions in fuel poverty, BP somehow can afford to pay its CEO a figure close to 250 times the typical British worker.Meanwhile at a global level we are already starting to see the damaging impact of climate change. In such a context governments need to accelerate the transition to clean energy, because the alternative is companies like BP enriching their executives and shareholders, while households and the planet pay the price.      9.58am GMT  BP paid its boss £8m last year; clawed back £1.8m from dismissed CEO Looney pay  BP paid its chief executive Murray Auchincloss £8m last year – and clawed back £1.8m from its former boss Bernard Looney’s pay package. Looney was dismissed in December for failing to disclose to the board personal relationships with colleagues. The pay details were disclosed in the oil giant’s annual report. Auchincloss received a salary of £1m for 2023, as well as benefits worth £338,000, a cash allowance in lieu of pension of £190,000 and an annual share bonus of £1.8m, and performance shares worth £4.7m. In January, the oil company appointed Auchincloss, its former chief financial officer, as its new chief executive after the shock departure of Bernard Looney last year. He had acted as interim CEO since September. The campaign group Global Witness said Auchincloss’s £8m paycheck would take an average UK worker 230 years to earn. Alice Harrison, fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness, said:   The millions paid out to BP’s CEO contrast with the millions of Brits in energy poverty, showing the sickening reality of our broken energy system. People everywhere, struggling to feed their families or heat their homes, have every right to be angry at BP’s huge profits and payouts. BP and its CEO count among the biggest winners of Russia’s war in Ukraine. BP, which still owns a big chunk of the Russian oil company Rosneft, profiteered massively from the resulting turbulence in energy markets, and now the firm has decided to give its CEO a multi-million, fat cat pat on the back whilst most people are living paycheck to paycheck.  The government is missing the opportunity to introduce a serious windfall tax and CEO bonus tax.   Updated at 10.02am GMT    9.15am GMT   Shares in Frasers Group fell nearly 2% this morning, after it announced that it was putting Matchesfashion into administration, less than three months after buying the luxury online retailer from the private equity firm Apax for around £50m. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said:  The financial woes facing Matchesfashion highlight the broader slowdown in the luxury goods market. High-end luxury demand has been waning amid a weak post-covid recovery in China as well as broader global macroeconomic pressures. While luxury brands typically raise prices without much of a problem for demand, perhaps now price hikes have gone too far as consumers’ propensity to spend wanes. In another worrying sign for the sector, Burberry issued a profit warning in January with its shares down by more than 50% over the past 12 months.  The speedy transition by Frasers from its purchase of Matchesfashion to its entry into administration suggests the financial woes facing the online fashion platform are clearly much worse than Frasers had thought, landing the brand in an unsalvageable situation. It also shows how even the e-commerce sector, which is relieved of many bricks and mortar retailers’ cost pressures, is still facing immense financial stress amid the weak global growth backdrop. Its rival Net A Porter similarly struggled with losses in the first half of last year. A lack of management continuity with a series of quick succession CEO changes in recent years haven’t helped Matchesfashion either.  Shares in Frasers Group are under pressure, trading down nearly 2%, bringing its year-to-date slide to more than 10% in a disappointing start to the year for its investors after a strong run since the pandemic.      8.55am GMT   European shares are drifting lower as traders await the non-farm payrolls jobs report at lunchtime. The UK’s FTSE 100 is down some 10 points, or 0.14%, while the Dax has lost 0.2%. France’s CAC is unchanged and Italy’s FTSE MiB edged 0.1% higher.     8.50am GMT   More on the European Central Bank, which has hinted that its first interest rate cut could come in June. Yesterday, the central bank cut its forecast for price growth this year from 2.7% to 2.3%. It now expects inflation to fall to 1.9% in the summer of 2025, and stay there until the end of 2026. President Christine Lagarde struck a cautious tone, saying more evidence was needed before the ECB cuts rates. There is a definite decline (in inflation) which is underway and we are making good progress towards our inflation target. We are more confident as a result, but we are not sufficiently confident. Investors have pencilled in three, or possibly four, cuts this year to the rate the ECB pays on bank deposits, which would take it from the current 4% to 3.25% or 3.0% .     8.36am GMT   Here is our full story on Matchesfashion:   Related: Luxury clothing brand Matchesfashion to enter administration       8.22am GMT   Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, has looked at the financial markets, and ahead to the US jobs report at lunchtime.  With little to upset the applecart, US markets powered to new record highs as peak optimism continued to drive buying interest.  Investors have been reassured over recent days following Federal Reserve chair Powell’s comments to lawmakers, which have contained no negative surprises. Most pertinently, the Fed stands prepared to reduce interest rates this year when circumstances dictate, and implied that such a move is not far away, even though there is no immediate rush to ease monetary policy in light of consistently favourable economic data. Indeed, the relatively benign backdrop will be put to the test again today with the release of the non-farm payrolls report. Investors will be hoping to see employment beginning to slow, while remaining solid, while also keeping an eye on wage growth which itself is inflationary. The data is expected to show that 200,000 jobs were added in February, following the previous month’s blowout number of 353,000, while unemployment is likely to remain unchanged at 3.7%. In the meantime, technology stocks continued to forge ahead in anticipation of the easier monetary conditions to follow and after what was a generally pleasing reporting season. The semiconductor index was a particular beneficiary of investor interest, as buyers sought to ride the current euphoric wave surrounding the potential for all things AI, with Nvidia enjoying further gains. In the year to date, the Nasdaq has now added 8.4%, closely followed by a gain of 8.1% for the S&P 500, while the Dow Jones is also in positive territory to the tune of 2.9%.  Turning to Asian stocks, he said:   Asian stocks largely joined the investment party, with most central banks increasingly agreed on the downward trajectory for interest rates, and with Japan’s Nikkei index continuing to attract overseas buying interest. This was despite the fact that the Bank of Japan could be heading in the opposite direction in exiting negative interest rates, which sent the yen higher after a recent spell of weakness, with wage growth rising to a level which could prompt the central bank to begin tightening policy. China markets were mildly positive, although the disappointment of this week’s National People Congress is still dampening sentiment. The lack of any announcements regarding an aggressive stimulative stance in reviving the economy at a time of high unemployment, low consumer confidence and an embattled property sector remains a source of despair for investors. The authorities appear keen to let the economy recover at its own pace and will have taken some solace from the latest import and export growth numbers, which came in ahead of expectations.      8.18am GMT  Packaging firm Mondi buys DS Smith; wealth manager Mattioli Woods to be taken private  There has been a flurry of takeover deals (or offers) in recent days and weeks, and today is no different. The packaging firm Mondi, based in Weybridge, has pounced on smaller rival DS Smith and agreed an all-share deal worth £5.14bn, which will create a paper and packaging group worth more than £10bn. Both companies said:  The combination is an exciting opportunity to create a pan-European industry leader in paper-based sustainable packaging solutions.  The London-listed company is to be bought out as wealth manager Mattioli Woods agreed to a £432m offer from the London-based private equity firm Pollen Street Capital. Private equity firms and some industry firms have been snapping up British assets because they are considered cheap, as sterling remains weak following Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the disastrous mini-budget 1 1/2 years ago. Yesterday, Nationwide building society agreed to buy its high-street rival Virgin Money for nearly £3bn in the largest UK banking deal since the 2008 financial crisis. The two lenders have reached a preliminary agreement on the key terms of the takeover, which – if approved – would narrow competition with the big four banks. It would create a combined group with £366bn in total assets, nearly 700 branches and more than 23 million customers. Buying Virgin Money, the UK’s sixth-largest retail bank, would also solidify Nationwide’s position as the second-largest mortgage lender behind Lloyds Banking Group, according to data gathered by the industry body UK Finance on outstanding home loans.   Related: Nationwide to buy Virgin Money in £2.9bn deal    Updated at 8.35am GMT    8.05am GMT   Matchesfashion was launched by a couple, Tom and Ruth Chapman, who opened their first store in Wimbledon in south London in 1987. They banked £400m after selling their online designer empire Matchesfashion.com to private equity investors in 2017. Funds advised by Apax Partners, a firm that owns Karl Lagerfeld and previously invested in Tommy Hilfiger, agreed to buy a majority stake in the business in a deal that valued Matches at £800m. The Chapmans, both in their 50s, cashed in the vast majority of their 67% stake, and stepped back from day-to-day involvement but retained an advisory role. However, the firm has struggled recently amid a slowdown in the luxury sector, and made a loss of £33.5m last year.  Updated at 8.06am GMT    7.43am GMT  Introduction: Matchesfashion to enter administration; stock markets rise on rate cut hopes  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group is putting Matchesfashion into administration, just weeks after buying the online luxury clothing retailer, putting hundreds of jobs in jeopardy. Frasers bought the firm – which sells fashion brands including Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, Stella McCartney and Valentino – for £52m from the private equity firm Apax in late December. According to reports, Teneo is being appointed as administrators. In a statement to the stock exchange, Frasers said:  Since Frasers acquired Matches, the business has consistently missed its business plan targets and, notwithstanding support from the group, has continued to make material losses. Whilst Matchess’ management team has tried to try to find a way to stabilise the business, it has become clear that too much change would be required to restructure it, and the continued funding requirements would be far in excess of amounts that the group considers to be viable. In light of this, Frasers has been informed that the directors of Matches have taken the decision to put the Matches group into administration. Frasers remains committed to the luxury market and its brand partners.  The news was first reported by Sky News.  Exclusive: Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group is putting Matchesfashion, the luxury online clothing platform it bought in December for £52m, into administration following weaker trading and the departure of a number of brands; a stock exchange announcement is likely tomorrow. More soon.— Mark Kleinman (@MarkKleinmanSky) March 7, 2024  Asian shares have hit a seven-month high, after investors were cheered by hints for potential interest rate cuts in the summer, and ahead of a key US jobs report today. They followed in the footsteps of higher US stocks, and the S&P 500 hit a record closing high of 5,157.34, up more than 1%, as the US Federal Reserve chief indicated rate cuts are likely to come this year. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at 538.47 points, its highest level since August. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.3% and the Shanghai Composite climbed 0.6%. The European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged yesterday and its president Christine Lagarde, who had been pushing back against the idea of early rate cuts, said at the press conference:  We did not discuss cuts for this meeting, but we are just beginning to discuss the dialling back of our restrictive stance.  She hinted strongly that this could happen at the ECB’s 6 June meeting, when wage data for the first quarter will have been published.  We will know a little more in April, but we will know a lot more in June  US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a similar tone on the path of US rates. He said yesterday the US central bank was “not far” from gaining the confidence it needs in falling inflation to begin cutting borrowing costs. He told the Senate Banking Committee:  I think we are in the right place. We are waiting to become more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. When we do get that confidence, and we’re not far from it, it will be appropriate to begin to dial back the level of restriction so that we don’t drive the economy into recession.  In Germany, industrial production rose by 1% in January from the previous month, but December’s decline was revised to 2% from 1.6%. Construction recovered alongside the chemical and food industries and machine maintenance and assembly, while carmakers posted a 7.6% slump, official data showed this morning.

        "content": "BP has clawed back £1.8m from sacked former chief executive Bernard Looney, but the oil company has awarded his successor an £8m pay packet that has been described by campaigners as “sickening”. Looney left in September after failing to disclose personal relationships with colleagues to the board after a tip-off from a whistleblower. The board later formally dismissed him and said it had found his actions amounted to “serious misconduct”. The departure, less than four years into his tenure as boss, shocked shareholders and forced the FTSE 100 company into an emergency search for a successor, even as it made billions of pounds in profits. Oil and gas companies have benefited enormously from the global energy crisis caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Looney would have been due a salary of £1.2m for 2023. However, BP applied provisions in his contract allowing the company to claw back £3m, meaning his salary for 2023 was technically -£1.8m, according to the company’s annual report, published on Friday. Looney will not have to actually pay BP that full amount, as most of the clawback provisions related to payments that had not yet been delivered. However, he will have to pay back bonus payments worth about £420,000. BP on Friday said Looney had lost out on total share awards and other pay worth about £29m, less than the £32m initially estimated. Murray Auchincloss stepped in as BP’s temporary chief executive after Looney’s departure, before being made permanent in January. The promotion has proven lucrative for Auchincloss, who previously served as chief financial officer. His total pay rose from £5.4m in 2022 to £8m in 2023, according to the annual report. Auchincloss’s pay package includes a £1m salary, £338,000 in benefits, and shares and cash bonuses worth £6.5m. He received car-related benefits, help with preparing his tax return, security assistance, health and life insurance and medical benefits, the annual report said. Auchincloss’s salary puts him among the top-earning FTSE 100 chief executives. BP reported profits $14bn for 2023, down from $28bn the year before at the height of the global crisis. Alice Harrison, the fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness, a campaign group on natural resources issues, said: “People everywhere, struggling to feed their families or heat their homes, have every right to be angry at BP’s huge profits and payouts. “BP and its CEO count among the biggest winners of Russia’s war in Ukraine.” She said BP had “profiteered massively from the resulting turbulence in energy markets, and now the firm has decided to give its CEO a multimillion, fat cat pat on the back whilst most people are living paycheque to paycheque”. BP’s executive bonuses for 2023 were cut by 2.5% to take into account the death of a contractor working for BP. In two further incidents, two employees working for a subsidiary of TravelCenters of America died. BP’s remuneration committee decided not to cut bonuses further because those deaths happened shortly after BP bought the company. BP did not comment on Global Witness’s criticisms."

        "content": "Boots is ordering administrative staff back into the office for five days a week from September as it tries to gear up the business before a potential sale or flotation. The CEO, Seb James, said the employees – who had been asked to work at least three days a week in the group’s various bases in Nottingham, Weybridge in Surrey, and London – should return for the full working week, arguing that the office was a “much more fun and inspiring place” with everyone in attendance.   Related: Working from home can bring big health benefits, study finds   “There is no doubt in my mind that the informal conversations, brief catch-ups and ability to meet in groups in person has been far more effective – and better for our unique Boots culture – than the enforced formality of remote meetings,” James told staff. He said the company would spend the next few months upgrading the IT systems in its offices so that all had access to video conferencing. He said the company would also improve its wifi, create more “quiet spaces”, improve car parking, and look at “how to make our food better”. About 3,900 Boots staff work at its head offices with the rest of its 52,000 employees in stores or in warehouses and distribution. James said the office should be Boots support staff’s “normal place of work” but conceded there would be “the odd day when it makes much more sense for you to work elsewhere – for either business or personal reasons”. He gave the example of a dentist’s appointment in the middle of the day. A Boots spokesperson said: “We are asking team members to make the office their usual place of work from 1 September. We really value the team spirit that comes with being together in person. There will of course still be times when working from home is necessary for either personal or business reasons.” The changes in working come as Boots’ US-based owner considers a sale or possible flotation of its UK retail arm, which could value the business at as much as £7bn. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which abandoned a £5bn sale of Boots and its related No7 Beauty brand in 2022, is thought to be exploring options including an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Boots’ change of tack marks a gradual shift in sentiment against working from home among many businesses since the Covid lockdowns ended. In December, the Nationwide building society told its staff they must work in the office at least two days a week from early this year while the tech firm Amazon has warned it will block promotions for workers who refuse to work in the office three days a week. Many large corporations started to call for an end to the more flexible working patterns in the autumn, led by the big tech firms such as Amazon, the Google owner Alphabet and Meta, and banks including Citigroup and Lloyds. Nearly two-thirds of bosses believe workers would return to the office five days a week within the next three years, according to a survey by advisory firm KPMG published in October. Most company leaders participating in that report thought pay and promotions could become linked to workplace attendance."

Benji Dymant, joint administrator from Teneo who was appointed on Friday, said immediate redundancies had been made so that the company could continue to trade while sale discussions progressed alongside an assessment of its future structure. “Like many luxury fashion retailers, Matchesfashion has experienced a sharp decline in demand over the last year, as a result of well-publicised pressures on discretionary spend, stemming from the high inflation and high interest macro environment,” he said. “Since Frasers’ acquisition of Matchesfashion in December 2023 and an injection of additional funding, trading has continued to deteriorate, increasing the funding requirements of the business. This ultimately has resulted in the directors taking the difficult decision to place the company into administration.” The problems at Matches come amid difficulties in the wider luxury market, which has slowed as even wealthier families have found themselves affected by the rising costs of energy bills and higher interest rates on mortgages and loans. Online specialists have been hit particularly hard. Retailer Farfetch agreed a controversial rescue deal with the South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang via a prepack administration in January. Richemont’s Yoox Net-a-Porter, which had been lined up for sale to Farfetch, is heavily loss-making. Frasers said in a statement: “Whilst the Matches management team has tried to find a way to stabilise the business, it has become clear that too much change would be required to restructure it.” Frasers added that the continued funding requirements to support Matches would be “far in excess of amounts” that it would consider to be “viable”. “In the light of this, Frasers has been informed that the directors of Matches have taken the decision to put the Matches group into administration,” it said.  Frasers, which owns the Flannels luxury streetwear chain, said it remained committed to the high-end retail market. When it acquired Matches in December, it said that the deal was an opportunity to strengthen Frasers’ luxury offering. Matches was founded in 1987 as a boutique in the London suburb of Wimbledon by husband and wife Tom and Ruth Chapman. The Chapmans, who held a majority stake, received about £400m after selling Matchesfashion.com to private equity investors in 2017 after a deal valuing the business at £800m. Frasers has a long history of buying often distressed sports, luxury and related brands at low prices to add to its large retail portfolio. In recent years has snapped up Jack Wills, Gieves & Hawkes, Evans Cycles and Game as well as snapping up the online fast-fashion brands Missguided and I Saw it First. Last week, it emerged that Frasers had acquired Wiggle, the online retailer of cycling and running gear that collapsed last October, for an amount less than £10m. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said: “The financial woes facing Matchesfashion highlight the broader slowdown in the luxury goods market. High-end luxury demand has been waning amid a weak post-Covid recovery in China as well as broader global macroeconomic pressures.”"

        "content": "Toyota has asked the Albanese government to water down its proposed new laws aimed at disincentivising the purchase of the worst polluting cars and hastening the importation of cleaner vehicles. Australia’s biggest selling brand – which makes popular models such as the HiLux and LandCruiser – has voiced concerns the scheme will harm rural and regional drivers. Toyota, in its submission to the government responding to the unveiling of its preferred model for the national vehicle efficiency standard (NVES) in early February, said it was broadly supportive of such a scheme, but made a raft of recommendations, including asking it to “revisit (the) stringency” of targets set out in its preferred “option B” model.   Related: Polestar joins Tesla in quitting auto lobby over its campaign against proposed vehicle efficiency standard   Toyota’s submission comes as rival manufacturers continue sparring with one another as well as climate advocates over claims the proposed NVES will increase the cost of popular car types and is too strict for the industry. Australia’s proposed fuel standard will place a cap on the emissions from new cars to incentivise carmakers to supply low- and zero-emissions vehicles. The cap will be lowered over time. Companies whose emissions averages come in below the cap will gain credits, which can be used by other companies who will be penalised for exceeding the cap. The government plans to introduce legislation before July that will take effect from January 2025.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Albanese government’s preferred model is expected to cut 369m tonnes of CO2 by 2050 – equivalent to the last six years of emissions from light vehicles in Australia. The company noted how the proposed NVES is loosely based on targets under the scheme in place in the US, and pointed to media reports from recent weeks citing unnamed sources that Joe Biden was considering softening certain tailpipe emissions reductions targets to 2030 in part due to pressure during an election year. “Reports indicate that the USA intends to decelerate the implementation of its annual emissions requirements and review the applicable timeframes,” Toyota’s submission said. “Evidence from the USA market shows that there has been a ‘slower than anticipated demand for electric vehicles’.” Toyota – which made three of Australia’s top 10 selling cars in 2023 and had come under criticism for taking until last week to introduce its first electric vehicle to the Australian market – also called for the introduction of penalties outlined in the proposed NVES model to be staggered. While the government has proposed a $100 per g/km of CO2 rate of penalty when the scheme comes into effect as planned for January 2025, Toyota said this was “too severe” and would risk costing consumers.   Related: Anthony Albanese flatly denies claim Thai PM asked for slowing of fuel efficiency standards   Instead, it wants there to be no financial penalties for manufacturers exceeding their caps in the first two years of the scheme. It then wants the penalty amount to increase in yearly phases, staggered to reach a penalty rate of $100 per g/km by 2029. Toyota also asked for the government to tweak the credit scheme in its preferred model by incorporating different types of credits carmakers can earn. Currently, “supercredits” for the cleanest of vehicles, “off-cycle credits” for specific green technologies used in cars that are not measured in tailpipe emissions, and “air conditioning credits” for using greener refrigerants, only feature in the least ambitious NVES model being considered, but not preferred, by the government. Echoing concerns made by the federal opposition, Toyota also warned of potential specific downsides for regional and rural Australians requiring specific higher polluting car types for their road conditions as opposed to others who could choose cleaner alternatives. “Given Australia’s unique conditions, vehicles need to be developed to a higher severity rating which require ladder frame chassis to navigate Australian roads which inherently increases vehicle mass (adding up to 300kg). “The target setting of Option B unfairly penalises the vehicles that everyday regional and rural Australian conditions require. Across industry, Option B as presented will negatively impact the consumers who need rather than want these products,” the company said. Toyota also backed in the position of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI), the industry body whose campaigning against the government’s preferred NVES model has seen Tesla and Polestar quit the group in protest with accusations it was not representing them and was making unsubstantiated claims the scheme would increase the cost of cars. Meanwhile, the Grattan Institute submission on the proposed NVES model estimated the policy would on average increase prices by about 1%, but that consumers would quickly be financially better off due to significant savings on fuel and maintenance costs. Australia remains one of the few major economies without standards. Industry analysts have routinely warned that manufacturers are treating Australia as a dumping ground for heavily polluting vehicles due to a lack of penalties. A new car sold in Australia uses, on average, 6.9 litres of fuel for each 100km compared with new cars in Europe and the US that use 3.5 litres and 4.2 litres, respectively."

        "content": "It’s been two years exactly since Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV, sent the share price crashing by 27% in a day as she announced a plan to ramp up the broadcaster’s adventures in streaming by launching ITVX. The City saw a large investment bill in the offing, plus definitive proof that the days of easy advertising money from old-style linear television were over, and tuned out. The share price has never seen 100p again and was 56p as recently as last month. But here – finally – comes a hint of better times. The evidence was not the headline numbers from Thursday’s full-year report on 2023, which showed a fall in statutory pre-tax profits of almost two-thirds to £193m and a thumping 15% decline in those linear ad revenues. Rather, it was evidence that the shift towards streaming, which was plainly necessary in the age of Netflix and Disney+, will deliver what it is supposed to do and will cost no more than originally promised. McCall spelled it out: 2023 was the year of “peak investment” in streaming and the group overall is “well placed to grow profits from here”. The long-term direction for the traditional ad market is still down, but not at a rate of 15% a year; there’s the Euro 2024 football coming, for starters. The critical new development, though, is that the intended compensatory element – advertising and subscription income from ITVX – is now genuinely compensating. Digital revenues improved 19% and the key 2026 target of hitting “at least” £750m is intact. In the meantime, ITV is launching another cost-cutting exercise (£50m) even before the last one (£150m) is complete. And last week’s useful news was the £255m sale of its 50% share in BritBox International, the non-UK streaming service, to BBC Studios for £255m. Some City analysts had valued the stake at zero in their models. Thus one can understand why ITV tends to appear in lists of conventionally undervalued companies that could be takeover candidates in bargain-basement Britain. Older viewers, who sat through speculation involving BSkyB and Virgin Media that went nowhere, will believe takeover tales when they happen. But, yes, one can do a sum-of-the-parts analysis on ITV (market cap: £2.8bn) and come up with numbers well above the current share price. The hard-to-value unit has always been ITV Studios, the production house, since a chunk of its revenues (from Coronation Street, daytime telly etc) are earned from ITV itself. But that portion is now only 30% and an outside endorsement of the value in TV production came recently in the form of the £1bn-plus at which All3Media is being bought by the Telegraph’s Abu Dhabi-backed bidder. In revenue terms, ITV Studios is twice the size of All3Media and is back to generating 13%-plus profit margins. Add it all up and two parts of the ITV group, Studios and ITVX, are growing while the third, the broadcaster, still spits out cash in better years than 2023. The balance sheet is in decent shape, a £200m-a-year dividend is secure and the BritBox receipts will be spent on a share buyback. The TV industry is still in a shocking state if you’re a freelancer working in it, but ITV’s investors can breathe again. The shares rose 12% to 68p on Thursday. A corner may have been turned."

        "content": "MPs are calling for new laws that would ban City firms from using gagging orders to silence victims, after a parliamentary inquiry found a “shocking” prevalence of sexual harassment and bullying against women in the UK’s financial sector. It is one of the key recommendations to come out of the Treasury’s committee’s  Sexism in the City inquiry, which raised concerns about a lack of progress in promoting and protecting women in one of the UK’s most lucrative industries. MPs – who held hearings with City executives, financial regulators, ministers and women from across the sector over eight months – said it was “shocking to hear how prevalent sexual harassment and bullying, up to and including serious sexual assault and rape, still are in financial services, and how poorly firms handle allegations of such behaviours”. They were also critical of “widespread misuse” of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), saying they had the effect of “silencing the victim of harassment and forcing them out of an organisation, while protecting perpetrators and leaving them free to continue their careers and go on and abuse others”. The influential cross-party committee is calling on the government to ban NDAs in harassment cases, as well as strengthen protections for whistleblowers. Meanwhile, firms need to embed a “zero tolerance approach” to misconduct across the UK’s financial and professional services industry, which employs about 2.5 million people and accounts for approximately £278bn or 12% of the country’s economic output. The chair of the Treasury committee, Harriett Baldwin, said: “This well-paid sector will only be able to maintain its competitive advantage if it is able to draw on the widest possible pool of talent. That’s why it is so frustrating that efforts to tackle sexism in the City are moving at a snail’s pace.” MPs – who launched the inquiry after sexual harassment allegations against the hedge fund boss Crispin Odey, and at the Confederation of British Industry – stressed that men needed to take a more active role in challenging and reporting bad behaviour by other men in their firms. “The elimination of sexual harassment, including serious sexual assault, and bullying should be a minimum standard expected to be guaranteed across the sector. It is a source of deep concern to us that this has not yet been achieved. This needs to be addressed, and urgently,” the report said. The committee also raised concerns about a lack of progress on equal pay and female senior leadership across the City. It said neither of the government’s flagship initiatives – gender pay gap reporting and the Women in Finance charter – in which firms voluntarily commit to bespoke targets to raise the number of women in top roles – “has brought about the change that was hoped for”. The industry still has the largest gender pay gap of any UK sector. Among the companies that are Women in Finance charter signatories, the average proportion in senior roles rose to just 35% in 2022, from 27% in 2016. “This is progress in the right direction, but at a rate of little over a percentage point a year, it is frustratingly low,” the committee said. The report called on charter signatories to forge a stronger link between executive pay and progress on improving diversity. MPs said employers should also be banned from asking for salary history, and should be required to list pay bands on job adverts. They are also calling for gender pay gap reporting rules to be extended to smaller firms with less than 250 staff, including private equity and hedge funds, which have some of the least diverse workforces. Additional concerns were raised about the removal of the bonus cap, which previously restricted banks to paying no more than two times an employee’s salary. The committee warned it could exacerbate pay inequalities, and it was pushing the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England to formally review in two years’ time the ripple effects on gender pay. The FCA said it would “reflect on the range of views received”. The Treasury was contacted for comment."

        "content": "It was a nice idea while it lasted. So-called challenger banks, it was fondly imagined, would emerge after the 2008-09 financial crash and show the UK’s big four banks how the industry should be run. Their weapons would be new technology, superior service and brand names unsullied by bonuses and bailouts. More than a decade later, market shares in the industry haven’t shifted meaningfully, and here comes the latest example of a challenger bank finding the independent life to be challenging. Virgin Money – a combo with the former Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks via a 2018 deal – is provisionally minded to agree to a £2.9bn takeover by the Nationwide Building Society. The fact that the buyer is Nationwide means this isn’t a surrender to one of the big four (which probably wouldn’t be allowed to buy anyway); Nationwide sits in the industry’s second tier and so can be viewed as a different type of challenger. But it is a far cry from 2018, when the Virgin crew were talking about creating “the UK’s leading challenger bank” to offer “a genuine alternative to the large incumbent banks”. Now the rhetoric is about selling “to complete our journey” as a national competitor. Virgin’s shareholders will get a 40% takeover premium, which sounds handsome, but also reflects how the shares had drifted sideways or lower for five years. At the offer price of 220p, the terms are well short of Virgin’s last tangible book value of 360p. Shore Capital’s analyst thinks “management could have perhaps driven a harder bargain”. The uncomfortable truth, though, is that size remains an enormous advantage in retail banking, in terms of everything from funding costs to investment in new tech and whizzy apps. Assistance for challengers from regulators never really materialised. Given that the last trading news from Virgin was higher-than-expected arrears in credit cards, there is a certain commercial logic in selling to Nationwide now. There are few other candidates for a deal and opportunities don’t always knock twice. For Nationwide, the commercial rationale is reasonable. The society will become a clear No 2 in UK mortgages (behind Lloyds Banking Group) and gets a proper entry into business banking, thanks to the Yorkshire and Clydesdale heritage within Virgin. Post-deal assets of £366bn, total lending and advances of £283bn and 23 million customers are chunky figures. On the other hand, there will be few quick cost savings since the Virgin operations will be run as a separate entity for a few years. That’s one luxury of not being a plc: you can take your time on integration. Another luxury, it seems, is that you don’t have to ask your owners for approval. Nationwide’s members will not get to vote on how almost £3bn of capital will be spent, which hardly seems true to the democratic principles of the building society movement. The chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, a former long-serving Clydesdale banker, had better be correct that this deal makes long-term sense."

        "content": "The Insolvency Service has begun legal action to have Lex Greensill disqualified from running companies for up to 15 years after the outcome of an investigation into the directors of his failed finance firm. The government agency said it had issued disqualification proceedings on behalf of the business secretary against the former Australian sugar farmer, who founded the Greensill group of companies. Greensill Capital – which specialised in supply-chain finance, where companies borrow money to pay suppliers – raised huge amounts from banks including Credit Suisse before it collapsed in March 2021. It became the subject of one of the UK’s biggest lobbying scandals after it emerged that David Cameron, the former prime minister who is now foreign secretary, had sent 62 messages during the Covid pandemic in 2020 to lobby ministers and officials asking for the then-struggling Greensill to be allowed access to the government’s coronavirus loan support scheme. The now Lord Cameron had joined Greensill as a lobbyist and adviser two years after he left Downing Street. The Treasury select committee found in July 2021 that Cameron had shown a “significant lack of judgment” in his actions to help the company, for which he worked and in which he owned stock options. In a statement at the time, Cameron said he had always acted in good faith, and had no idea until the end of 2020 that Greensill Capital was in danger of failure. The Insolvency Service said on Thursday it had issued disqualification proceedings on behalf of the business secretary using powers under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Records at the high court in London show a director disqualification claim has been launched against Greensill by the government, which is represented by the law firm Howes Percival. Greensill is represented by the law firm Ellerman. The records also show Greensill has launched a legal claim against the Department for Business and Trade for alleged “misuse of private information”, though further details of the case are not yet available publicly. Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, a court can make an order banning an individual from being a director or a director may offer to give a disqualification undertaking. Disqualification can last for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Service said: “We can confirm that the Insolvency Service has commenced director disqualification proceedings against Alexander (Lex) Greensill to have him disqualified from running or controlling companies for a period of up to 15 years in respect of his conduct as a director of Greensill Capital (UK) Limited and Greensill Limited.” It said it could not comment further as the case was ongoing. A spokesperson for Lex Greensill said: “Lex Greensill recently issued proceedings against the Department for Business and Trade in the high court as a result of the Insolvency Service’s conduct during the investigation that led to this action. “Mr Greensill rejects this action as wholly without merit and will robustly address it.”"

        "content": "In advance of International Women’s Day, your timely piece on the World Bank’s new report finding no equality for working women in any country (5 March) was a stark reminder of the work left ahead. However, it’s important ask whether there is equality for working women at the World Bank itself, or any of the seven major international financial institutions (IFIs) that my colleagues and I studied in 2023. At the time we found that, though the share of women in leadership at these important institutions has doubled in the last two decades, not a single IFI had reached gender parity in its management ranks. Since the study was released, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has achieved gender parity in management – which is to say that only one IFI has achieved this at any point in time. It’s also worth noting that gender equality gains are easily reversed and prone to periods of stagnation.  Most IFIs recognise the essential role women must play in development, and have put forth robust gender strategies. The World Bank places the engagement of female leaders as one of three strategic objectives. Yet only two out of nine IFIs have a female head; and no woman of colour has ever been the head of an IFI. Their boards of directors are even further from parity than the managerial positions filled by technocratic ranks.  It’s important that these institutions, collectively responsible for more than a quarter of a trillion dollars of lending in 2022, lead by example. They should do it because it’s right, and central to their work. Closing the gender gap has been labelled “macrocritical”: essential to economic growth, financial stability, and lower income inequality.  As we ask what more can be done for gender equality this International Women’s Day, we must also look at the role we all can and should play.

        "content": "  5.48pm GMT  Closing post  Time to wrap up. Economist have warned that the UK’s pre-election budget, delivered yesterday, is based on ‘Fiscal fiction’, rather than plausible plans and assumptions. Citigroup warned that the chancellor’s spending plans as “fiscally offside” by £50-60bn, as they are based on unlikely productivity growth, and implausible spending cuts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies accused both the government and the opposition of a conspiracy of silence about what is actually ahead, with its director Paul Johnson saying:  They, and we, could be in for a rude awakening when those choices become unavoidable.  The IMF predicts that stabilising the UK’s debt is likely to require additional tax rises. While the Resolution Foundation showed that this will be the first parliament in modern history to see a fall in living standards. Here are today’s stories on the aftermath of the budget:   Related: UK to have first parliament in modern history with fall in living standards, says thinktank     Related: IFS warns of Labour and Tory ‘conspiracy of silence’ over future tax and spending plans     Related: How a Conservative budget failed to help women (again)     Related: What is national insurance and should it be scrapped?

He wasn’t persuaded, though. And today, the IMF has waned that stabilising the UK’s debt is likely to require additional tax rises. Speaking at the IMF’s regular press briefing on Thursday, director of communications Julie Kozak told reporters:   “IMF staff will be analysing the announced policies in greater detail but the aim to continue the fiscal consolidation pursued since 2022 to reduce inflation and stabilise debt is welcome.”  She added that the national insurance cut and reform of the child benefit system had been funded by “well-conceived revenue-raising measures”. Kozak said:   “Significant spending to protect service delivery, growth-enhancing investment and the appropriate commitment to stabilise debt are likely to require additional revenue-raising measures in the medium term.”      5.28pm GMT   Retail giant Ikea has today briefed staff about a proposal to restructure some of its operations, union Usdaw reports. The proposals that could impact all 3,233 staff who currently work at certain Ikea warehouses (or fulfilment areas) in the UK and Ireland. Usdaw says it will enter consultation talks, with their national officer Bally Auluk explaining:   “Staff have today been briefed by the company about a significant restructure within the business, mainly affecting customer fulfilment operations. Usdaw will now enter into meaningful consultation talks with management, where we will interrogate their business case for this proposed restructure. “Our priorities are to get the best deal possible for Usdaw members and keep as many staff as possible employed within the business. In the meantime, we are providing our members with the support, representation and advice that they need throughout this process. Any Usdaw member with concerns should contact the union direct.”      2.26pm GMT  Citi: UK 'fiscally offside' by up to £60bn  Citigroup fears that the UK is actually up to £60bn away from meeting Jeremy Hunt’s fiscal mandate. Ben Nabarro, chief UK economist at Citigroup, warns in a research note today that the Office for Budget Responsibility is being too optimistic when it assumes UK productivity will grow at 0.9%. Citi predicts productivity growth will be just under 0.5%, as it has been since the financial crisis. Nabarro writes:  This in part reflects supply shocks that we think are likely to intensify in the years ahead. But the implication is that the fiscal forecasts are probably around £30-35bn worse than today’s OBR estimates imply.  He also predict that the real terms cuts penciled into the current spending profile are undeliverable, so a further £20-25bn in spending is also ultimately likely.  We therefore continue to see the UK as fiscally offside by around £50-£60bn.   Citi:• OBR productivity forecasts way too optimistic • So fiscal forecasts are really £30-35 billion worse than OBR view• Future real spending cuts undeliverable - means extra £20-25 billion of spending likely• All in all, UK “fiscally offside” by £50-60 billion— Andy Bruce (@BruceReuters) March 7, 2024  But, that margin could fall to £15-£20bn “if rates rally as we currently expect”, Nabarro adds. The OBR yesterday showed that Hunt has just £8.9bn of headroom to show debt falling, as a share of GDP, in 2028-29 – a very low amount in historic terms, as Resolution Foundation showed this morning (9.29am). That, though, was dependent on fuel duty no longer being frozen, and on painful cuts to public spending after the election – which the IFS says would require “staggeringly hard choices” (see 10.41am). Nabarro warns that the UK’s post-Covid fiscal headwinds are only just beginning, and cites three reasons to be worried:  First, much of the pain associated with the withdrawal of both Covid and energy support we think has yet to come – with the former effect in particular elongated by contemporaneous restrictions and alike. Alongside lagging multipliers, the removal of Covid-era support exerts a materially larger headwind to growth over the years ahead. Second, the UK also faces the fiscal adjustment associated with higher rates, which means a tighter primary balance than in the years before the pandemic. And third, in the years ahead, we think fiscal policy is itself also likely to have to adjust to a more disrupted, volatile world. The implication is fiscal policy is also likely to need to be tighter in ‘normal times.’ With the OBR estimating the government currently has only a 54% change of meeting even the loosest definition of fiscal sustainability. That is not good enough.

After its latest policy meeting, the ECB has left the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. This means its benchmark deposit rate (paid on commercial bank deposits) remains at an all-time high of 4%, while its main refinancing operations will operate at 4.5% and its marginal lending facility (overnight loans to banks) sticks at 4.75%. The ECB’s latest staff projections show that inflation has been revised down, in particular for 2024 due to cheaper energy prices Staff now project inflation to average 2.3% in 2024, 2.0% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Back in December, the ECB expected inflation would average 2.7% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The projections for core inflation (excluding energy and food) have also been revised down today; they now average 2.6% for 2024, 2.1% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026.

With a nod to the rising tax burden, the shadow chancellor pointed out:  “They’re giving with one hand and taking twice as much with the other.”  Opening day two of the Budget debate, Reeves told the Commons:  “The stark reality of yesterday’s Budget is clear: taxes rising, living standards falling, growth stalling and yet again making promises they can’t deliver. “The Tories have failed on the economy, they are out of ideas and they are out of time.”  Our Politics Live blog has full details of the Westminster reaction:   Related: Hunt ‘repeating Truss’s errors with £46bn unfunded tax proposal’ to scrap national insurance, says Starmer – UK politics live   The original “omnishambles” budget was delivered by George Osborne in 2012, when he unveiled an increase VAT on some hot foods.

They, and we, could be in for a rude awakening when those choices become unavoidable, he fears. On the politics of the budget, Johnson points out that the non dom changes and the extension of the energy profits levy announced by Jeremy Hunt were Labour policies.  In the “through-the-looking-glass” world of pre-election argy-bargy this will appear to make Labour’s job more difficult. They want to earmark the extra revenue from these taxes to fund some of their spending plans.  A moment’s thought should show this for the nonsense that it is, at least in the real world of fiscal constraints and trade-offs, if not in the rhetorical world of electoral politics. First, the numbers involved are trivially small by comparison with the fiscal challenges. Three or four billion of revenues a year don’t even count as a drop in the fiscal ocean when it comes to the scale of the challenges facing us. And second, the fact that the changes have been announced doesn’t mean the revenue disappears. It’s still there, indeed more definitely so. By accepting the NI cut, the opposition does make life more difficult for itself. That is £10 billion a year they have lost. The opposition have been just as shy as the chancellor about telling us what they actually intend to do on taxes and spending after the election. If I am sceptical about Mr Hunt’s ability to stick to his current spending plans, I am at least that sceptical that Rachel Reeves will preside over deep cuts in public service spending.      10.41am GMT  IFS: UK faces eye wateringly tough choices to bring debt down  The IFS fear that the next parliament could well prove to be the most difficult of any in 80 years for a chancellor wanting to bring debt down.  Paul Johnson says:  Even stabilising debt as a fraction of national income is likely to mean some eye wateringly tough choices – and we are talking tens of billions of pounds worth of tough choices – on tax and spending.  Johnson points out that the goal of getting debt falling, as a share of GDP, just in five years time is based on a whole series of unlikely, or undesirable things. Perhaps the unlikeliest is that the government will stop freezing fuel duty. And the least desirable perhaps is that investment spending will fall by £18bn a year in real terms.  There’s also the prospect of £20bn of cuts to day-to-day spending on a range of public services outside of health, defence and education. That, Johnson says, will require some staggeringly hard choices which the government has not been willing to lay out. He says:  Indeed, we heard yesterday that the next spending review, in which these choices will have to be announced, will rather conveniently not happen until after the election. One only has to look at the scale of NHS waiting lists, the number of local authorities at or near bankruptcy, the backlogs in the justice system, the long-term cuts to university funding, the struggles of the social care system, to wonder where these cuts will really, credibly come from.

And IFS director Paul Johnson says that nothing has changed very significantly following what Jeremy Hunt did yesterday, and what the OBR said. That means we are:  heading for a parliament in which people will on average be worse off at the end than at the start, looking at a debt to GDP ratio that is at its highest level in 70 years and is showing no signs of falling; facing debt interest payments at close to all time highs; seeing worrying increases in the number of individuals moving onto health and disability related benefits, bringing huge challenges for those households and rising costs for the public purse; (despite the genuinely significant cuts in NICs) stuck with a situation where tax revenues will have risen by a record amount as a share of national income over this parliament and still heading towards UK record levels; implicitly planning on big cuts in public investment spending overall and cuts to many areas of day-to-day spending on public services despite very obvious signs of strain in many areas.   📺 @PJTheEconomist opens our #Budget2024 event, warning that we:- are still heading for a parliament in which people will on average be worse off at the end than at the start- have the highest debt to GDP ratio in 70 years- have debt interest payments close to all time highs.— Institute for Fiscal Studies (@TheIFS) March 7, 2024      10.10am GMT   Eyebrows were raised two years ago when high street stalwart Marks & Spencer announced it was appointing two CEOs to replace departing chief executive Steve Rowe. And today, the arrangement is being put out to grass. M&S has announced that co-chief executive Katie Bickerstaffe will retire from the retailer in July. Bickerstaffe became co-CEO in 2022, alongside CEO Stuart Machin. This unconventional structure meant she was in charge of driving M&S’s strategy of selling across multiple platforms, plus clothing & home, international and financial services, while Machin handled day-to-day leadership and M&S’s food business. Today, M&S says that a “planned leadership evolution” will see Bickerstaff move on, and take up other board roles “in line with the original transition plan”. Bickerstaffe says:  “I took on the Co-CEO role to support Stuart as he succeeded to Chief Executive Officer and because of my love for the brand and my determination to see the transformation of M&S through to the next stage. We have built a strong team, made great progress, and it is now right that the business and function heads report directly to Stuart. I will leave with great memories and a strong sense of achievement.”  M&S’s shares are up 49% in the last year.  Updated at 10.25am GMT    10.01am GMT  UK firms' inflation expectations drop in February,  In happier news, British businesses’ expectations for inflation over the coming years have dropped. A survey from the Bank of England has found that firms expect to curb their price rises over the next year,with output price inflation expected to decline by 1.1 percentage points over the next 12 months. Companies also expect inflation to fall, but remain over the UK’s target. One-year ahead CPI inflation expectations have declined further to 3.3% in February, down from 3.4% in January. Happily for workers (if not the Bank), firms expect to pay inflation-beating pay rises. Expected year-ahead wage growth remained unchanged at 5.2% on a three-month-moving-average basis, the BoE says, while annual wage growth was 6.7% in the three months to February.     9.49am GMT  UK suffering slowest growth of any party’s period in office since the Second World War  Resolution Foundation also show the stark impact of the UK’s economic stagnation on living standards. It will still take until 2026 for real wages to return to their 2008 level, their analysis shows – had real wages kept growing at their prefinancial crisis pace, the average worker in 2023 would have been around £14,000 better off And, if the election is held at the end of this year, the period since 2010 will have seen GDP per capita grow by 0.8 per cent per year, and average wages by just 0.2 per cent per year in real terms.  On both measures, this would be the slowest growth of any party’s period in office since the Second World War:     9.40am GMT   The big, long-term picture is that by 2027-28, middle-earning workers will have done best out of the “personal tax rollercoaster” in this parliament, says Resolution Foundation. It has calculated that workers earning between £26,000 and £60,000 will be “the net winners” by 2027-28, while lower and higher earning taxpayers will be worse off.  Overall, 55% employees will gain, they say – but that includes “significant variation”. Full time employees will on average gain £120, their part time colleagues lose £240. In contrast, employers are paying more national insurance as the starting threshold for employer NI has been frozen. And pensioners have also lost out; around 8 million pensioners are taxpayers, who lose from freezes to Income Tax thresholds but don’t benefit from NI changes. Resolution’s analysis shows:  Compared to where the personal allowance might have been in 2027-28 without freezes, basic rate pensioners will be around £700 worse off and – taking into account also the higher-rate threshold freeze – the average taxpaying pensioner will lose around £1,000. In total, policy will have increased taxes for pensioners by around £8 billion, a significant portion of the net personal tax rise.  But, as Resolution Foundation also point out, pensioners have also benefitted from the triple lock, and from higher savings rate in the last couple of years.     9.29am GMT   The economic forecasts that underpinned yesterday’s budget did not “play ball” for the chancellor, according to James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation. The key news was the change in the OBR’s forecast for inflation – the fiscal watchdog has now “called time on high inflation”. That weaker outlook for inflation (assuming the OBR are right) is clearly good news, but Smith also points out that it leads to lower tax receipts in future years. The OBR is also forecasting a slightly smaller economy in cash terms. Resolution has calculated that the Chancellor has spent £65bn on tax cuts over the next five years, around a third of which has been funded by tax-raising policies. So, with Hunt borrowing a further £10bn over the next five years, his fiscal buffers are alarmingly thin. The £8.9bn of headroom to ensure debt is falling in that final year of the forecast is the second lowest on record, Smith explains:     9.13am GMT   Resolution Foundation are presenting their analysis of the budget now. Their CEO, Torsten Bell, begins by saying it was inevitable that we’d get tax cuts yesterday, as it was a pre-election budget (although he doesn’t believe we’ll go to the polls as early as May).  Kicking off shortly at 9am!Game changer? Assessing the Budget’s economic, and electoral, impactWatch our event with @OBR_UK Chair Richard Hughes @JumanaSaleheen @robertshrimsley @JamesSmithRF & @TorstenBell and submit questions on Slido.https://t.co/Jn7dBenJ0Z— Resolution Foundation (@resfoundation) March 7, 2024  Resolution’s analysis shows that high earners will get most of the benefits from the national insurance cut:  An extra 2p cut in the basic rate of NI takes it to its lowest level since the 1980s in April, handing workers gains of up to £750 next year (2024-25) with 78 per cent going to the top half of the household income distribution.This will be partially offset by the latest set of threshold freezes this April, leaving the majority (79 per cent) of employees paying less tax as a result. Gains will average £450, with the largest net tax cuts going to those earning £50,000 (who will gain £1,200) while taxpayers earning £19,000 or less will be worse off, losing more from threshold freezes than they gain from rate cuts.   Updated at 9.14am GMT    8.49am GMT  Hunt: Theoretically possible to have another pre-election budget  The chancellor has also dangled the possibility of further budget changes before the next election. Asked on Times Radio whether he is planning another fiscal event before the election, Jeremy Hunt said:   “No, but if there’s an autumn election, which is the working assumption, then theoretically it would be possible to have one.”  He also conceded that eliminating the “double tax on work” in the form of national insurance and income tax is unlikely to happen in this Parliament, saying:  “That’s a huge job. “I don’t think it’s realistic to say that’s going to happen any time soon.”  As Labour points out (see earlier post), it’s also not clear how it would be funded….     8.33am GMT   Jeremy Hunt is now discussing the budget on the Today Programme. He’s arguing that his national insurance cut will help cut the UK economy’s dependence on high migration, by bringing an extra 200,000 people into the workforce. That would fill one in five of the vacancies across the economy [estimated at 932,000]. Q: Who are the losers from your budget? Hunt says he chose to focus on helping people in work. The losers, he says, are foreigners who were resident in the UK who will pay “significantly more tax” through the abolition of the non-dom status, and the Scottish oil and gas industry, as the windfall tax is being extended. Q: But fiscal drag means million of people are paying more tax (due to thresholds on income tax levels not being raised in line with inflation). They call you the fiscal drag queen of British politics, don’t they? He points to the rise in spending in the pandemic, and the energy support package, which led to higher taxes. He now wants to make a start at bringing taxes down. Hunt says he’s not been called a drag queen before (the “fiscal drag queen” is a term coined by Henry Mance in the Financial Times). And he argues that someone on the average wage will see a £230 tax increase through frozen tax thresholds this year, but a £900 decrease through his two, 2p cuts to national insurance. Hunt promises:  I’m being completely honest, that we have had to put up taxes. What I’m saying is, I am the person and the Conservative Party are the party that wants to bring those taxes back down.  The interview ended rather testily, though, with Hunt claiming it was “unworthy of the BBC” for Today presenter Amol Rajan to say the UK was “ravaged by economic shocks, at best drifting, at worst stagnant… hooked on foreign labour. The birth rate is collapsing. Many public services are creaking. Councils are going bust”.  Updated at 9.02am GMT    8.12am GMT  Labour: How would abolishing NI be paid for, chancellor?  Yesterday, Jeremy Hunt floated the idea that national insurance could be abolished, by vowing to end the unfairness of “double taxation” by income tax and NI. And this morning, Labour are demanding to know how this could be paid for. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast:  “Yesterday, at the end of the Budget, the Chancellor started floating this idea that he was going to get rid of National Insurance altogether. “Well, that would cost £46bn. And I would like to know where that money is going to come from, because I just wouldn’t make a promise like that without being able to say where the money is going to come from. “I think it is incumbent on politicians to be honest about the trade offs that have to be made.”  £46bn is slightly large than the £45bn package of unfunded tax cuts announced in the infamous Liz Truss mini-budget of September 2022, Reeves points out on Radio 4’s Today Programme.

Halifax reports that average house prices rose by +0.4% in February, the fifth monthly rise in a row. That left property prices 1.7% higher on an annual basis, a slowdown on the 2.3% increase in the 12 months to January. The typical UK home now costs £291,699, around £1,000 more than last month, Halifax reports.

While it is encouraging that we’ve seen growth in recent months, what happens next remains uncertain. Although lower mortgage rates, alongside expectations of Bank of England interest rate cuts this year, should help buyer confidence in the short term, the downward trend on rates is showing signs of fading. Even with growing wages and inflation falling back, raising a deposit and affording a sizeable mortgage remains challenging, especially for those looking to join the property ladder, so it remains a possibility that there could be a slowdown in the housing market this year.”      7.40am GMT    Yesterday's ‘sweet and sour’ Budget combines £8 billion election year personal tax cuts, with post-election plans for £38 billion of tax rises and spending cuts......with middle earners the main immediate winners, while low or high earners will still see their taxes rise. pic.twitter.com/x7NYaYWtox— Resolution Foundation (@resfoundation) March 7, 2024      7.40am GMT  Pensioners the big losers from Jeremy Hunt’s Budget, says think tank  Resolution Foundation also reports that pensioners are the big losers from Jeremy Hunt’s Budget. That’s because national insurance, which was cut by another 2p in the pound yesterday, is paid by workers on their wages, but not by the retired. Overall, Resolution says, the policy choices announced during this Parliament have shifted support from the rich and the old to the young and the poor. Resolution’s Torsten Bell says:  “It has been a frenetic few years for tax policy making, with huge rises and cuts announced in quick succession. Middle earners have come out on top, while taxpayers earning below £26,000 or over £60,000 will lose out. The biggest group of losers are pensioners, who face an £8 billion collective hit. “Looking at all policy changes announced this parliament reinforces the sense that the Government has reversed course from the approach that dominated during the 2010s. Back then, support was focused on pensioners and takeaways on poorer, younger households. This time it is those aged over 65 and on the highest incomes who are set to lose most.  Resolution Foundation’s overnight analysis shows:  Shifting state support from the rich to the poor… While 78 per cent of the personal tax cuts announced in the 2024 Spring Budget go to the richest half of households, the Foundation’s analysis of all tax and benefit policies announced in this parliament – including changes to National Insurance, Income Tax, pensions tax, non-doms tax and Capital Gains Tax, reductions to the taper rate in Universal Credit, and duty freezes – show a very different picture. Typical households are set to gain £420 a year on average, while the poorest fifth gain £840 and the richest fifth lose an average of £1,500. And from pensioners to millennials…. The Foundation’s analysis of these same policy changes across the age distribution shows that households headed by someone aged 18-45 will gain £590 on average, compared to an average loss of £770 for those aged 66 and over.      7.39am GMT  Introduction: UK facing record low for living standards  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK is facing a record low for living standards, analysis of yesterday’s budget shows, despite the pre-election tax cuts announced by chancellor Jeremy Hunt. The Resolution Foundation has crunched the budget, and concluded that Hunt has “thrown fiscal caution to the wind” yesterday, leaving very little room (just £8.9bn) to hit his fiscal rule to have debt falling in five years.  Now it turns out that contrary to what some people were thinking this morning, the @OBR_UK actually CUT the amount of headroom the Chancellor had before this Budget. From 13bn to 12.2bn. The Chancellor “spent” £3.2bn of that, leaving him with £8.9bn. pic.twitter.com/9Sf3JxjbGO— Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) March 6, 2024  But while Hunt has made a net tax cut of £9bn, the UK’s cost of living crisis means real household disposable incomes (how much money households have after tax, adjusted for inflation) are set to fall between 2019 and 2025 – for the first parliament in modern history. And looking further ahead, the tax take will be a 70-year high by 2028-29:   Related: Budget 2024: UK taxes head for highest level since 1948 despite Hunt’s NI cut   Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, warns that the budget maths is based on fictional cuts to public services after the election:  The £19 billion of cuts to unprotected public services after the next election are three-quarters the size of those delivered in the early 2010s. The idea that such cuts can be delivered in the face of already faltering public services is a fiscal fiction. “Budgets are always a big day for Westminster, but the big picture for Britain has not changed at all. This remains a country where taxes are heading up not down, and one where incomes are stagnating. “Big tax cuts may or may not affect the outcome of that election, but the task for whoever wins is huge. They will need to both wrestle with implausible spending cuts, and also restart sustained economic growth – the only route to end Britain’s stagnation.”  Yesterday, the Office for Budget Responsibility said Hunt’s plans meant funding for non-ringfenced government departments – including local government and prison services – was on track to fall by 2.3% per year. Here are some of the key points from Resolution’s analysis (they’ll be discussing the budget at an event this morning).  Filling out the tax sandwich… Fresh reductions in National Insurance and Fuel Duty, coupled with previously announced tax threshold freezes, mean a net tax cut of £9 billion is taking effect in the election year. But this is dwarfed by the estimated £27 billion of tax rises that came into effect last year (2023-24) and the £19 billion that are coming in after the election (2025-27). …by throwing fiscal caution to the wind. The Chancellor’s fiscal headroom against his fiscal rules is the second lowest on record, just a third of the average level seen since 2010. But this is not because his fiscal rules are strict – in fact, the plans in this Budget would violate three out of the four sets of such rules followed by Conservative Chancellors since 2010. Britain’s £14,000 wage depression... Despite the Office for Budget Responsibility reducing its forecast for inflation, real average wages are only set to regain their 2008 levels in 2026, a staggering near-two lost decades of pay growth. Had pay instead continued along its pre-financial crisis path over this period, the average worker in 2023 would have been around £14,000 better off. ….and a record low for living standards. Across this Parliament (between 2019 and 2025), real household disposable income (RHDI) is set to fall by 0.9 per cent – the first parliament in modern history to see a fall in living standards.

        "content": "Booming demand in the UK for private health insurance, as NHS waiting lists remain at near-record levels, has boosted annual profits at Aviva, with more frequent claims and higher medical costs driving up premiums. Britain’s biggest general insurer said sales of health insurance had risen 41% in 2023 compared with the previous year, with strong demand from businesses and individual customers, who were taking out policies as the crisis in the state health service continues. The step up in Aviva’s health insurance business contributed to a 9% rise in annual operating profits to £1.5bn last year, better than analysts had forecast. Aviva’s chief executive, Amanda Blanc, said: “We’ve seen individuals looking at the NHS and saying: ‘I can afford to buy health cover, so I will do that.’ So we’ve definitely seen a take-up in individual policies. We’ve also seen small businesses take advantage of the opportunity to protect their employees.” More small employers are offering health cover to their staff and some big companies are expanding their cover, with add-on provisions such as a digital GP service, she said, which offers customers access to an NHS-qualified primary care doctor through video consultation and text. About 1.2 million people are covered by Aviva health policies, making it the third biggest player in the UK market after Bupa and Axa. Charlotte Jones, Aviva’s chief financial officer, added that more people were signing up for health cover through their company than before. “Where it’s always been there, but they haven’t prioritised it – through salary sacrifice or something like that – there’s more of a push, and more people are prioritising it.” Blanc said premiums had gone up partly due to higher medical costs, which are rising by 8% to 10%, although Aviva had been able to limit price rises through long-term contracts with hospitals. Customers were also making more frequent claims, she said – both for low-cost items such as physiotherapy, which they traditionally would have got through the NHS, and more expensive procedures such as surgery. Hospital admissions paid for through private medical insurance remained at near record levels between January and September of 2023, up 7% on a year earlier, according to data released by the Private Healthcare Information Network this week. “That doesn’t surprise me at all,” Blanc said. “There are some schemes where you have a waiting time but if you can’t get an NHS appointment within six weeks, your private health cover kicks in.” NHS waiting lists for routine operations in England hit record highs last year but fell back in January. The waiting list is expected to “start to fall consistently but slowly from the middle of 2024”, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted – though it will remain larger than it was before the Covid pandemic until 2030. Aviva also sells pensions, life insurance, and car, home and travel cover, and has 16 million customers in the UK, out of 19 million globally. Blanc was paid £6.6m last year, up 22% from 2022, boosted by a higher long-term share bonus award, the company’s annual report showed. The Aviva share price rose more than 4% in early trading on Thursday and subsequently traded almost 2% higher at 463.8p. The company has been the subject of takeover speculation, with the Italian insurer Generali reportedly looking at it. Blanc shrugged this off as “random market chatter”. A number of UK companies have attracted takeover interest recently, including Aviva’s rival Direct Line, which rejected a £3.1bn offer from a Belgian insurer as “highly opportunistic” last week. “If you look at most UK stocks today, you would say that they’re probably not at the valuation that they should be at”, Blanc said, pointing to Brexit, the pandemic, the turmoil around the mini-budget and other issues. “Certainly, we would say that there’s plenty of room to go in our share price. But we are really focused on the things that are in our control, which is the brilliant performance of the business.”"

        "content": "A month-long delay to a promised pay rise at Tesco has been condemned by some staff because it leaves them on less than the minimum wage, while saving the supermarket more than £17m. Tesco, one of the UK’s biggest employers with more than 330,000 staff, has pledged to increase the minimum pay for its shop workers from £11.02 an hour to £12.02 next month, but the rise will not be implemented until 28 April, almost a month after the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over increases to £11.44 on 1 April. One member of staff told the Guardian: “We are all extremely angry at this especially as this was approved by our union.” The delay is allowed under HMRC rules, which say minimum pay rates can be applied from the start of the “pay reference period” starting on or after 1 April – which for Tesco begins on 28 April. Based on the 220,000 workers affected by the pay rise missing out on £1 an hour compared with the promised new rate, Tesco saves more than £17m by introducing the pay rise at the end of April. It saves 42p an hour compared with if it paid the new legal minimum wage for those 21 and over, equivalent to more than £7m over the period in question. Daniel Adams, the national officer for the Usdaw union, which agreed the new pay deal, said: “Whilst we would have preferred that the company implemented this increase earlier, as Usdaw had originally requested, the regulations do allow them to make that decision. “Usdaw has negotiated a significant pay rise that makes Tesco workers amongst the highest paid in the sector. While the union will always seek implementation on the pay anniversary date, which was 2 April last year, the outcome of these negotiations meant that the date was delayed until later in April to allow for the highest investment in pay possible.” The union said the 9% rise in pay next month would benefit 220,000 people and represented one of the largest investments in pay by Tesco in a single year amid heavy competition for workers. Asda recently announced it was increasing minimum hourly pay to £12.04 an hour while Sainsbury’s, Aldi and Lidl have upped pay to £12 an hour. A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are investing over £300m in colleague pay, bringing our hourly rate to £12.02, which is significantly ahead of the national living wage, in a deal that has the full support of Usdaw. “Our new rate is effective from our April pay period as set out in the HMRC guidelines, and we are fully compliant with all NLW requirements. We have a strong track record of making substantial investments in colleague pay and, since 2022, we have increased hourly pay by 26%, investing more than £750m in our colleagues. The company said it had also enhanced other benefits including an increase in paternity leave to six weeks, and an extension of our colleague discount allowance to £2,000 per year. The row comes after the supermarket in January upgraded its profits expectations for the year by £50m to £2.75bn as it reported “a stronger trading performance than anticipated” over the festive period. He partly credited the success to “more colleagues on the shop floor, helping to deliver market-leading availability”."

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt name-checked two formidable women in his speech on Tuesday: Labour’s Angela Rayner and Rachel Reeves, both of whom were the butt of lumbering jokes, which only underlined their political potency. There were no mentions of the millions of women out of the chancellor’s direct eyeline, however, who are often on the frontline when it comes to enduring the stresses of a stagnant economy. Given that men tend to be higher earners on average, across-the-board tax cuts such as Jeremy Hunt’s 2p national insurance reduction – the centrepiece of Wednesday’s statement – tend to benefit them more than women. Analysis by the Women’s Budget Group (WBG) of campaigning economists suggests the average single woman would gain £279 from the latest tax cut, against £346 for a single man. The average lone mother would gain just £85, they said, given this group often struggle to work, and can get trapped in low-paid jobs.   Related: ‘Heartbreaking’: the nursery forced to close over Hunt’s free childcare policy   As Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, the WBG’s director, put it: “Yet again the chancellor has announced tax giveaways that benefit men over women and benefit the better off rather than those most in need.” However, the main impact for women of Wednesday’s budget – as it has been from the broad thrust of economic policy over many years – is likely to be felt in the systematic underfunding of public services. Women tend to use public services more: on average, they still take on more family caring responsibilities than men, for children and elderly relatives. And women are the core of the public sector workforce, dominating jobs such as nursing and childcare. That means public sector austerity hits many women twice over: they suffer from the lack of Sure Start centres, libraries and GP appointments, while also battling to deliver overstretched and underfunded public services themselves. Many men are in exactly the same situation, of course; but on average, women bear a disproportionate share of the burden. And while it very much was not the main message of his speech, Hunt’s budget foreshadowed another five-year squeeze for public services.   Related: Labour opens huge lead over Tories among female voters   His tax cuts are funded partly by implementing spending plans so tight that few economic experts believe they are plausible. Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the government has given very little detail about spending beyond the election – aside from a series of upbeat promises about boosting productivity. For many departments, that suggests tough years ahead. Sometimes budgets are as interesting for what is not included as for what finds its way into the speech – and there was not a single word from Hunt about social care, which, let us not forget, Boris Johnson boldly promised to “fix”. In reality that would have meant imposing a ceiling on how much an individual would have to spend on their care, as Andrew Dilnott suggested more than a decade ago. That was to be paid for through a “health and social care levy” – effectively a 1.25 per person increase in national insurance, a tax Hunt has since reduced twice, and is now hinting heavily that he would now like to scrap the tax altogether. Aside from underlining the handbrake turns the Tories’ have made in recent years, the silence on social care points to deeper questions, about how politicians at Westminster see society’s toughest challenges. Social care funding has been deemed politically untouchable since Theresa May’s “dementia tax” apparently helped deprive the Conservatives of their majority in the 2017 general election. But behind the omertà at Westminster lie millions of individual stories – and once again, women are on the frontline. Two-thirds of dementia sufferers are women, according to the Alzheimer’s society. So are the vast majority of the notoriously underpaid staff caring for them. Reeves, who recently published a book on the forgotten female pioneers of economics, has made no secret of the fact that if she becomes the first female chancellor, she would bring feminism to the Treasury – including by helping low-paid workers in undervalued jobs such as care. But as analysis by the Women’s Budget Group over many years has made clear, the health of the nation’s public services is also a feminist issue. There were some budget bright spots for women in Wednesday’s statement. Nurseries have been sounding the alarm for weeks about the underfunding of Hunt’s pledge to dramatically expand free childcare for the under-threes. Of course, dads benefit from the scheme too – but given women still tend to take on the lion’s share of parenting and pay a career penalty through motherhood, the provision of more free nursery places is a boon for mums who want to work. Amid dire warnings about childcare settings being unable to provide the new places needed to deliver Hunt’s pledge, he announced an extra £500m over the next two years to increase funding rates. It is unclear as yet whether this will resolve the sector’s issues – but it will certainly help. Meanwhile, the WBG’s analysis points to one clear area where women are the winners from Wednesday’s decisions: they will not be hit nearly as hard by the clampdown on high-rolling foreign-born taxpayers – because two-thirds of non-doms are men."

        "content": "Nationwide building society has agreed to buy its high-street rival Virgin Money for nearly £3bn in the largest UK banking deal since the 2008 financial crisis.  The two lenders have reached a preliminary agreement on the key terms of the takeover, which – if approved – would narrow competition with the big four banks. It would create a combined group with £366bn in total assets, nearly 700 branches and more than 23 million customers. Buying Virgin Money, the UK’s sixth-largest retail bank, would also solidify Nationwide’s position as the second-largest mortgage lender behind Lloyds Banking Group, according to data gathered by the industry body UK Finance on outstanding home loans. It is the latest in a string of deals involving Virgin Money, which experienced a huge growth spurt after buying the beleaguered lender Northern Rock from the government for £747m in 2011, nearly four years after its takeover target was nationalised during the financial crisis. Seven years later, Virgin Money was at the centre of another big UK banking deal, when it was bought by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group (CYBG) for £1.7bn  in 2018. But while CYBG paid a large sum to retain the Virgin Money brand, Nationwide’s plans mean Virgin Money’s name will disappear from the high street within six years. Phasing out the brand could save Nationwide, which is led by the former TSB boss Debbie Crosbie, tens of millions of pounds long term. Virgin Money paid £17m to Virgin Group, which is 100% owned by Sir Richard Branson, for use of the name last year. Branson is expected to reap about £414m from the deal because of his remaining 14.5% stake in Virgin Money, which he founded in 1995. The billionaire, who wore a pinstripe suit and bowler hat at the bank’s launch, said at the time the venture was “a chance to change a stagnant industry and provide customers with much-needed competition”. The former Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia welcomed the potential deal. Gadhia, who is still a Virgin Money shareholder, said it would be a “shame” to see the brand go but believed the potential takeover would “likely to accelerate benefits for Virgin Money customers”. She also applauded Crosbie’s role in pushing forward one of the largest UK deals in recent history. “It’s fantastic to see a significant deal led by a female leader of a major financial institution”. The proposed £2.9bn deal offers Virgin Money shareholders 220p a share, representing a 38% premium on the lender’s share price on Wednesday. Virgin Money shares soared on the news, rising 34% to 212p – not far below the offer price – on Thursday. The company’s chair, David Bennett, said: “The board of Virgin Money is pleased that Nationwide recognises the considerable strengths and opportunities that exist across our business, with the potential acquisition delivering attractive value for our shareholders.”  Nationwide said it would maintain its “branch promise”, having pledged to keep open all of its existing branches until at least 2026. However, it said any closures already planned by Virgin Money – which has only 91 sites – would still go ahead. Nationwide, which has about 18,000 employees, said it did not plan to make “any material changes” to Virgin Money’s 7,300-member workforce in the near term, but did not give further details about longer-term job cuts, which are common when two groups combine. The Swindon-based building society, which has cut nearly 800 of its staff over the past 12 months, said it “would safeguard the existing contractual and statutory rights of Virgin Money employees, including pension arrangements and redundancy policies”. Nationwide’s chair, Kevin Parry, said the proposed deal could ultimately help the building society offer cheaper products and make one-off payments to its customers.  The mutual was founded as the Southern Co-operative Permanent building society in 1884, became Nationwide in 1970 and has grown into a group with more than 600 branches. While it is rare to see a mutual taking over a listed bank, analysts said Nationwide’s surprise move proved it wanted to stay relevant. “Nationwide clearly does not want to be stuck in the past and wants the knowhow and access to scoop up future customers who demand more cutting-edge financial services,” said Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. Nationwide has until 4 April to provide a formal offer, which will then have to be put to Virgin Money shareholders. Branson’s Virgin Group, the largest shareholder, confirmed on Thursday that it was prepared to approve the deal. While Nationwide is technically a mutual, it will not have to seek approval from its members. The announcement comes just weeks after Barclays announced it was buying the bulk of Tesco Bank for £700m, while another building society, Coventry, has entered intotalks to potentially buy the Co-operative Bank from its hedge-fund owners for an unconfirmed sum."

        "content": "The rail regulator has given the green light for a new operator to provide services on the west coast mainline from London to Scotland, as the government aims to ramp up competition on the train network. Grand Union has been given the go-ahead by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) to start running services from London Euston to Stirling from June 2025, in a move the regulator said would increase competition and choice for passengers. Four return services to Stirling will run daily from Euston, and stop at Milton Keynes, Preston and Carlisle, directly competing with Avanti, the current franchise operator for the line. In Scotland it will stop at Whifflet, Greenfaulds, Larbert and Stirling, which do not currently have a direct service to and from London. Grand Union will run the service as an open access operator, a provider that can apply for access to lines, without requiring government subsidy and taking on full commercial risk. It is the first open access operator to use the west coast mainline. In February 2023, when setting out the government’s plan for rail, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, said it would provide support for more open access operators, saying they would play an important part in the future of the railway. There are three open access operators on the east coast mainline, including Lumo, owned by FirstGroup, which runs services between London and Edinburgh, and Grand Central, which runs from London to Sunderland and Bradford. These numbers are expected to grow in the future, with Grand Union securing permission to run services on the Great Western mainline between London Paddington and Carmarthen in south Wales from 2025. FirstGroup last week announced it was in discussion with regulators about extending some of its London-Edinburgh Lumo services to and from Glasgow. Grand Union was set up by the former British Rail executive Ian Yeowart, who also created other open access operator Grand Central Trains in 1999, before it was sold to Arriva in 2011. According to the company, the services from London to Stirling will include free wifi for all passengers and provide more legroom when compared with other services. The company, which will be based in Scotland, will also create 100 full-time roles. Stephanie Tobyn, the ORR’s director of strategy, policy and and reform, said: “Our decision helps increase services for passengers and boost competition on Britain’s railway network. “By providing more trains serving new destinations, open access operators offer passengers more choice in the origin and price of their journey leading to better outcomes for rail users.” Grand Union was approached for comment."

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt and Rachel Reeves are joined in a “conspiracy of silence” over tens of billions of pounds in tough tax and spending choices, with the next government likely to inherit the toughest outlook for the public finances in 80 years, Britain’s leading economics thinktank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor’s budget on Wednesday had laid the ground for “staggeringly hard choices” due after the general election for whichever party forms the next government. The experts on the UK’s public finances said Hunt had earmarked cuts to spending on public services outside health, defence and education worth £20bn, while driving up national debt levels within the narrowest of margins to meet his self-imposed fiscal rule. After the chancellor suggested the Conservatives could abolish employee national insurance after the next election, the IFS director, Paul Johnson, argued it was a claim that was “not worth the paper it’s written on, unless [it is] accompanied by some sense of how it will be afforded”. Hunt’s ambition would cost more than £40bn, according to the IFS, as the starting point of tens of billions of pounds in further uncosted measures floated by the Tories including an increase in defence spending and planned increases in fuel duty. In stinging remarks about the government, Johnson said Hunt had laid the ground so that the next parliament “could well prove to be the most difficult of any in 80 years” for a chancellor wanting to bring down debt.  Interactive  However, he also issued sharp criticism of the shadow chancellor, suggesting that neither party had been upfront with the public over difficult decisions for tax and spending. Johnson said Labour had been “just as shy” as the Conservatives about spelling out its plans for taxes and spending after the election. “If I am sceptical about Mr Hunt’s ability to stick to his current spending plans, I am at least that sceptical that Rachel Reeves will preside over deep cuts in public service spending,” he said. Highlighting near-record NHS waiting lists, councils facing bankruptcy, severe backlogs in the justice system, and struggles in the social care system, the IFS said the challenges in the public sector meant Hunt’s plans for deep post-election cuts in government funding lacked credibility. The chancellor on Wednesday pencilled in a 1% a year real-terms increase in spending on services, while promising to find efficiency savings in a multibillion-pound productivity drive. However, the IFS said the plans would entail deep cuts of up to 3.5% a year over the next parliament for unprotected government departments – including prisons, justice and local government. Avoiding these cuts would require a top-up to the government’s spending plans worth up to £20bn. While suggesting Hunt could find some efficiency savings in the public sector, it warned large increases would be difficult to achieve after more than a decade of austerity that had already squeezed out costs from the system. Johnson suggested the Conservatives and Labour would need to level with voters over the scale of this challenge, warning that further large tax cuts would mean higher government borrowing and debt, or deeper cuts to services. “The government and opposition are joining in a conspiracy of silence in not acknowledging the scale of the choices and trade-offs that will face us after the election.  “They, and we, could be in for a rude awakening when those choices become unavoidable,” he said."

        "content": "ITV has recorded a sharp drop in annual profits as the brutal advertising downturn experienced last year outweighed record revenues in its studios business, which made the recent hit drama Mr Bates v the Post Office. The UK’s largest free-to-air commercial broadcaster said pre-tax profits had fallen by 61% to £193m in 2023, against £501m in 2022, after it was hit by a drop in advertising revenue as well as the planned investment costs in its ITVX streaming service. The broadcaster said it would cut costs by £50m, on top of an existing drive to save £150m between 2019 and 2026. The new cuts will come mainly from technology and operational efficiencies Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV, said it was “way too early” to discuss whether jobs would be affected. The company has already frozen hiring and clamped down on expenses. The broadcaster has struggled with a difficult advertising market which McCall has described as the “worst advertising recession since the global financial crisis” of 2008. The slump in advertising was reflected in the biggest round of job cuts at Channel 4 in more than 15 years. The broadcaster is focusing on higher growth through its studios business, which makes shows such as Love Island as well as dramas such as Mr Bates v the Post Office, which was seen by 4 million viewers an episode when it was aired in January, and a further 10 million through the channel’s on-demand service, ITVX. McCall said on Thursday that the Mr Bates drama had now been sold to 12 markets worldwide and she was “very proud” of its impact. “It shows the power of television,” she said. “Television is really brilliant at emotional engagement and moving people ... and moving them to action. Mr Bates is one of the most brilliant examples of that. It has had such an impact on society and the public has risen up and the government is listening.” Group revenues fell by 2% to £4.3bn, with TV advertising down by 15%. Digital revenues rose by 19% and its studios arm recorded a 4% increase, to £2.2bn. McCall said total advertising revenue was expected to be up 3% in the first quarter of 2024 helped by digital advertising revenues. ITV expects advertising in to be bolstered by upcoming events including the Uefa Euro 2024 football championships in June. “The advertising market last year was challenging to say the least but we expect this year to be better than last year,” she said. ITV said that 2024 would also be affected by the 2023 US writers and actors strike which will delay about £80m of revenue until 2025 and it had also experienced weaker demand from free-to-air broadcasters in Europe who were holding back spending until there was more certainty in the advertising market. Last week, ITV sold its 50% stake in BritBox International, the British specialist streaming service, to BBC Studios, its joint venture partner for net proceeds of £235m in cash which it plans to return to shareholders. ITV shares rose by 8% on Thursday."

        "content": "Britain’s under-pressure green power industry has received a surprise fillip after a renewables developer pledged to plough £10bn into what would become the largest portfolio of battery storage projects in the country. NatPower, a UK startup that is part of a larger European energy group, is poised to submit planning applications for three “gigaparks”, with a further 10 to follow next year. Battery storage projects are seen as a key part of the jigsaw to decarbonise Britain’s power grid, allowing electricity generated by wind turbines and solar panels to be stored for use when weather conditions are still or not sunny. The NatPower investment would lead to the construction of 60 gigawatt hours of battery storage, with solar and wind projects also in the pipeline. The two gigaparks would be located in the north of England, with a further site in the west of the country planned later this year. The projects would be built on industrial land, and also through leasing deals with farmers. The potential investment would mark a bright spot in a troubled landscape for the renewables industry. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 exacerbated a squeeze in gas markets and accelerated countries’ drives towards renewable power. However, the resulting surge in demand and global inflation has put pressure on supply chains and forced companies to rein in their ambitions. In his budget speech on Wednesday, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced £120m to support the expansion of “low carbon manufacturing supply chains”. A record £1bn will be set aside for an upcoming auction to support offshore windfarm projects after an auction in September failed to attract any bidders. Hunt also said £160m would be paid to Japan’s Hitachi for two sites earmarked for nuclear power stations – the Wylfa facility on the island of Anglesey or Ynys Môn in north Wales, and the Oldbury site on the banks of the river Severn in South Gloucestershire. Efforts to decarbonise the electricity grid in Great Britain have also been undermined by waiting lists of up to 15 years for new projects, such as wind- and solar farms, to connect. Energy officials have embarked on a drive to kick out so-called zombie projects from a connections waiting list. NatPower, which plans to finance, own and in some cases operate its projects, said it had also set aside £600m to invest in new substations. Stefano Sommadossi, the chief executive of NatPower UK, said: “To solve the bottlenecks that are slowing the shift to clean energy, we will drive investment into the grid itself, collaborating with grid operators to deliver more than 20% of the new substations required. “By investing in substations and focusing on energy storage first, we will enable the next phase of the energy transition and bring down the cost of energy for consumers.” Battery storage projects could also help significantly reduce curtailment – a process in which wind and solar projects receive payments to stop generating power when supply exceeds demand. Without upgrades to the grid, these costs could reach £3.5bn a year by 2030, according to the thinktank Carbon Tracker. Britain’s battery storage industry remains fragmented but includes projects of all sizes, including a £750m development at the Trafford low carbon energy park in Greater Manchester and a string of projects devised by the co-founder of the collapsed energy supplier Bulb. NatPower UK, which launched in the UK in 2022, is part of a specialist Luxembourg-headquartered European energy group, which is backed by its management team and Tyrus Capital, a private equity firm. It scouts for land, obtains permits and typically sells projects on when they are ready to build. The group is raising the money to carry out its UK ambitions through private companies and pension funds. An announcement on securing further investment is expected within weeks. The government has set a target to generate power entirely from renewable sources by 2035, while Labour has pledged to achieve this by 2030. Industry sources believe this is ambitious, amid concerns that Britain could struggle to meet the increase in demand for electricity for everything from electric vehicles to heat pumps while efforts to build new power projects falter."

        "content": "Virgin Australia’s announcement that it will allow small cats and dogs to fly at passengers’ feet may have triggered excitement among pet lovers eager for the future service, but there’s plenty of detail yet to be worked out – including one big elephant in the cabin. In what will be an Australian first, Virgin have said they hope to launch the offering within 12 months, noting they will work out many of the finer details of the service as they say they need to wait for regulatory approval. In the absence of such details, there’s no doubt plenty of travellers alarmed at the announcement will be thinking twice about booking a future flight with the airline until it becomes clear how it will deal with certain animal-related concerns.   Related: Frequent flyer programs: which is best for Australians – and is there a catch?   After all, animals running loose on planes have had alarming and sometimes fatal consequences. In 2010, a small plane running short domestic routes in the Democratic Republic of Congo plummeted to the ground in a crash that killed 20 people, with the sole survivor later reporting the incident occurred after a crocodile ran loose on the aircraft. Here’s everything we know about how Virgin Australia’s pets in the cabin scheme will work.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Which pets will be allowed? Virgin Australia has said the pets in cabin service will be “limited to small cats and dogs”. The airline hasn’t specified what “small” means. Carriers in the United States that already have such schemes in places restrict certain breeds. Will we be able to just walk (small) pets on to the plane? No. The rules here have been strictly set out. Pets must be carried in a Virgin Australia-approved pet carrier and placed under the seat in front of the owner for the duration of the flight. Taller travellers who already struggle with legroom may find it challenging. So I can’t show off my beloved Rover to my fellow passengers? Nope. In fact, only certain rows of seats on certain domestic flights will be eligible for pet owners wanting to use the service. There is to be no sitting in laps, walking of pets down the aisles or taking them to the bathroom. Then what happens if Rover needs to do his business mid-air?   Related: Escaped crocodile may have caused Congo plane crash   This may be the question on everybody’s mind, but Virgin Australia have not yet been forthcoming with an answer. It’s understood they’re still figuring out the finer details of the scheme. Moisture-absorbent mats have been used for animal droppings from service animals – which are already allowed in plane cabins. What’s stopping this from turning plane cabins into feeling like a zoo? It’s unclear what Virgin Australia’s plan is in the event of a barking fit, or what is to be done with a particularly odorous pets. Will Virgin Australia really be allowed to do this? There don’t appear to be any laws stopping any airline from allowing pets in cabins. In fact, Virgin’s expectation of needing regulatory approval could even be overly cautious. In 2021, Australia’s air regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa), changed its rules so that airlines no longer require its explicit permission to carry animals. Pilots and airlines now have discretion, so long as its safe. “They must consider how to restrain animals, effects on other passengers, not blocking exit rows, dealing with droppings/urine. The procedures for pets would be added to their operations manuals,” a Casa spokesperson said in 2021. On Thursday, Casa released a statement: “The regulation places the responsibility on the operator and pilot in command of the aircraft for ensuring the safety of the flight when an animal is carried on an aircraft.” Why is Virgin Australia doing this now? Because Australians want it as an option, the airline said. Virgin Australia said that in a survey of its Facebook followers from 2021, 85% of respondents voted in favour of the airline launching pets in cabin flights. In more recent research conducted by Virgin Australia with Australian pet owners, nearly 70% of respondents advised they would travel with their pet in the cabin, with 57% saying they would fly more regularly if the service was a reality. In the increasingly tough battle to dent the dominance of Qantas (and its budget carrier Jetstar), which controls more than 60% of the domestic market, allowing pets in flight is one way for Virgin to set itself apart. Currently, passengers can only fly with assistance animals in cabins on Australian airlines, and only if they require them. All other pets must fly in cargo holds. Airlines around the world, including Qantas, have faced criticism after animals travelling in the bellies of their planes died in transit. The announcement also brings a positive story for Virgin Australia after the unexpected announcement their CEO, Jayne Hrdlicka, would be stepping down. The abrupt resignation led to media reports that she was axed by the airline’s private equity owners, Bain Capital, suggesting they were unhappy with her performance in the lead-up to the carrier’s much hyped re-listing on the stock exchange.   Related: Prescription pets: 'I got a doctor’s note to fly with my dog'   How have pets fares in cabins overseas? In many overseas jurisdictions pets have been able to be carried in cabins for a fee for some time, with everything from pigs, miniature horses and ducks spotted on flights in the past. The US has long allowed people to fly with emotional support animals as long as airlines allow it. Passengers have tried to bring a diverse range of creatures on board over the years as they tested the parameters of the rules. In 2018, a woman was prevented from bringing a peacock on board a United Airlines flight, despite its owner being willing to pay an additional fare for her feathered friend. But the scores of requests for unusual support animals eventually led the US transport department to ban all animals except dogs as service or emotional support animals in December 2020. Non-service animals can be taken on board in the US, with most airlines charging a fee and having limits for small pets only. Some Middle Eastern airlines also allow falcons inside cabins and to have their own passports."

        "content": "It was a good week to announce a British Isa, one could argue. Another two mid-sized UK companies, the haulier Wincanton and the telecoms equipment group Spirent Communications, are falling to foreign buyers, causing fresh agonising over how the unloved UK stock market has become a bargain bin for overseas predators. A British Isa, goes the theory, will incentivise UK investors to prefer UK companies over the excitements of US tech stocks or S&P 500 tracker funds. Here’s the problem. The chancellor’s design for a British Isa could hardly be more modest. He has created a £5,000 allowance, with the same Isa tax advantages, to be invested in purely UK assets (precise definition to follow after a consultation). That’s on top of the existing £20,000 maximum, where investors are free to roam the globe. Crunch the numbers on the likely takeup of the extra £5,000, however, and the sums amount to “a rounding error,” as investment platform AJ Bell put it. Only about 800,000 people are now wealthy enough to use their £20,000 allowance in full in any year. On the generous assumption that all of those people have another £5,000 to invest, the extra cashflows into UK assets would equate to £4bn a year. That is equivalent to only 0.2% of the current £2tn-plus value of the UK stock market.   Related:  British Isa will be created ‘to encourage investment in UK firms’, Hunt confirms   Even £4bn, however, will be an overestimate in practice because about a third of investments in stocks and shares Isas already go into UK assets. So, for £20,000-a-year Isa savers who allocate £5,000 to the UK without a prod, no fresh incentive to prefer UK assets has been created. They can carry on as before, just with a bigger tax perk. The radical alternative, pitched by some lobbyists, would have been to turn stocks and shares Isas into entirely UK-only affairs. That would have shifted serious money since overall Isa equity investment is worth about £35bn a year. That idea, presumably, was a non-starter for two reasons: first, it would look too much like the UK government telling people how to invest their money; and second, there would be uproar because the UK stock market has been an international laggard in performance terms. Thus the most intriguing halfway-house design for a British Isa came from the thinktank New Financial: increase the allowance to £25,000 and make 50% of it UK-only. The predecessors to Isas, personal equity plans, had a 50% UK threshold when Nigel Lawson introduced them in his 1986 budget, so Jeremy Hunt could have claimed a philosophical linkage with the Thatcherite vision of “a shareholding democracy”. He could also have argued that tax breaks for the wealthiest UK savers should have a more direct benefit for the UK economy. New Financial reckoned an extra £10bn a year could be channelled into UK equities. Instead, the chancellor opted for the formula that will have the least impact and, argue some investment platforms, will create the most administrative hassle. Since FTSE 100 companies, the most likely target for any extra investment, are in any case very international – about 75% of their collective earnings come from overseas – the flag-waving exercise looks like a gimmick. Ditching the 0.5% stamp duty on UK share purchases would have been a more obvious way to make a splash."

        "content": "The chancellor has been accused of producing a “cut and paste” budget that fails to provide the tax changes needed to protect pubs and restaurants. UK Hospitality, the trade body for the sector, said Jeremy Hunt’s budget had done little to “bridge the sector through a difficult period”, and failed to reduce the escalating costs businesses now face. Allen Simpson, deputy chief executive of the body, said: “I listened to the budget waiting for the support the industry needs, and it didn’t come; it was a cut-and-paste from last time.   Related: Jeremy Hunt gave us a hit-and-run budget. But unlike cornered chancellors past, he showed no shame | Martin Kettle   “He’s pulling levers that he’s pulled before, and didn’t work, we believe that the levers he needs to pull are the levers which support costs for businesses.” The chancellor announced that the freeze on alcohol duty would be extended until September, a change that is expected to save 3p on a pint of beer. But UK Hospitality and businesses had been calling for a reduction in VAT to 12.5% for hospitality businesses, as well as a 3% cap on business rates when they rise by an expected 6.7% in April.  Interactive  More than 6,000 hospitality venues closed due to cost pressures in the 12 months up to December 2023, according to the Hospitality Market Monitor. Stosie Madi, co-owner of the Parkers Arms pub in Lancashire, said businesses were relying on a VAT cut, and the lack of action could lead to higher prices for consumers. She said: “He’s not reduced VAT. That’s the biggest thing that could help hospitality, because hospitality is on its knees because all the costs are going up.”  Chris Jowsey, chief executive at Admiral Pubs, said: “The industry reckons it’s worth about £114m in a year. The problem is we pay £15bn in taxes. So it’s a welcome nose towards pubs, but it’s not really sufficient in that sense.” Retailers were also disappointed at Hunt’s failure to reduce business rates, which will increase in line with the CPI inflation rate in April. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents most major retailers, said: “How can a whopping 6.7% tax rise in April be justified, when the chancellor himself is saying inflation is forecast to be nearer 2%? “The cost of living crisis has taken a toll on businesses and households. Consumer confidence remains low and retail sales volumes in 2023 were the lowest in four years. Yet the chancellor has done little to promote growth and investment, instead hindering it with the business rates rise in April.” There was also anger that the government did not revive tax-free shopping for overseas tourists, a relief it scrapped in 2021. More than 500 business leaders, backed by the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation for Small Businesses, wrote to Jeremy Hunt asking him to reinstate the tax break. However, Hunt’s revelation that the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca would be investing £650m into two new facilities in Liverpool and Cambridge, thanks to government support for the life sciences sector, was warmly received. This includes £450m of investment in a manufacturing site at its research facility in Speke, Liverpool, which will support research, development and manufacture of vaccines at the base. There will also be £200m to build a new facility at a life sciences technology cluster in Cambridge. Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: “AstraZeneca’s investment shows that if we get the policy environment right, we can reinvigorate medicine manufacturing in this country, creating new jobs and prosperity across the country.” Elsewhere, IATA director general Willie Walsh was highly critical of the chancellor’s decision to raise air passenger duty on some flights, accusing him of breaking a promise he made in September not to raise taxes on flying. The changes mean air passenger duty increases by 10% on premium economy and business class flights from April 2025. The rise will add £66 in tax on a businesses class fare from London to New York, meaning the fare could cost up to £647 when the changes come in. Walsh said: “It’s a shortsighted cash grab of a government that has run out of ideas, competence and basic integrity.” "

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt is in favour of delaying the election until the autumn, and it showed. His second budget had all the hallmarks of a holding operation from a government hoping the summer will bring better economic news and leave open the possibility of another package of measures in six or seven months’ time. Sure, there was the much-heralded cut in national insurance contributions, which formed the biggest chunk of a front-loaded £14bn stimulus package. Certainly, he took every opportunity to have a pop at Labour in a deeply political speech. This will be the last budget before the election, but it did not feel like the last roll of the dice for the government. Hunt did what all chancellors do on budget day. He accentuated the positive. There was much talk about how the economy had turned a corner, but nothing about how this is on course to be the first parliament in modern times where living standards have fallen. He was keen to say that taxes had been cut by £900 for the average worker as a result of last year’s autumn statement and this year’s budget. He forgot to mention that the long-running policy of freezing thresholds means the Treasury is still sucking spending power out of the economy in this and every year until the end of the decade. The budget tax cuts mean the fiscal tightening for 2024-25 is just over £41bn rather than the £56bn previously planned. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government’s spending watchdog, also made a number of sobering points. As a result of his rather modest tax cuts, Hunt has a rainy day fund of just £9bn – low by historic standards. The sums only add up, according to the OBR, on the assumption that fuel duty is raised – something that has not happened since 2011 – and that there is no growth in public spending per head of population over the next five years. The fact is that Hunt only had three options for the budget. The first was to play it absolutely straight and rule out any giveaways on the grounds that the public finances were not in decent enough shape to warrant it. That is what he would have done were it not for the fact that an election is looming and the Conservatives are a country mile behind in the polls. Option two was to ignore the OBR’s strictures and just go for it with a bumper package of tax cuts and spending increases paid for by an increase in borrowing. Liz Truss tried that and prompted a mini-financial crisis, which is the reason Hunt became chancellor in the first place. So that left option three. Stick to the letter of his fiscal rules – that debt as a share of national income should be falling in five years’ time – but still find a way to fund a package of tax cuts. That is what the chancellor did, through a combination of stealth taxes, post-election plans for public spending (which look implausible) and by leaving only the titchiest amount of spare cash in reserve. Will it work? Hunt says the economy is improving, and he is right about that. Inflation and interest rates are coming down, growth and living standards are picking up. The recovery is still in its early stages though, and for the government time is fast running out. Given his self-imposed fiscal constraints, Hunt’s second budget was all he felt able to come up with. But the Conservatives needed more. They needed a gamechanger. This was not it."

This would limit the scope of any further cuts given the estimated £13bn of headroom the Chancellor has to play with. “While this cut would be welcome news to hard-pressed taxpayers, in the context of frozen tax thresholds and other planned tax rises in the years ahead in areas such as stamp duty land tax, the tax burden is still on track to exceed all-time highs. Meanwhile, public services continue to be a source of frustration for much of the electorate. “A key area of focus today will be the updated OBR forecasts, particularly in light of the recent falls in both inflation and growth. With spending headroom having been created largely due to falling interest rates over the forecast period, this may be an early sign of light at the end of the tunnel. Whether this can come in time to limit electoral damage for the Conservatives remains to be seen, but with talk of a May election date, today’s budget seems unlikely to have much impact on existing polls even if, for now at least, there is a small benefit for our wallets.”      10.13am GMT    The UK Construction sector has a spring in its step, optimism for the year ahead the highest it’s been since Jan 22 - with the exception of the commercial sector, all 3 main categories of construction activity saw a near-stabilisation of business activity in Feb with… pic.twitter.com/nUmhsvPzzN— Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) March 6, 2024      10.12am GMT   Confidence among UK builders has picked up, reports Max Jones, director in Lloyds Bank’s infrastructure and construction team:   “The mood music surrounding the sector has become more upbeat in recent weeks, with healthy infrastructure pipelines a common theme coming out in our conversations with contractors. While inflation remains sticky, the industry managed well through its peaks and there’s a feeling of confidence it will move in the right direction for the rest of the year. Looking to longer term planning, contractors are ramping up investing in the skills needed to ensure they can deliver on the demand for projects key to decarbonisation. Those that invest today will be best placed to reap the rewards of the net zero transition.”      10.10am GMT   Conditions in the UK construction sector should improve this year, predicts Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, unless the Budget destabilises the situation. Following this morning’s construction PMI report, Pugh says:  ‘The gradual recovery in the construction industry continued in February, despite the exceptionally wet weather, driven by an improvement in housebuilding. And there are valid reasons to expect things to pick up in the second half of this year. House prices have started rising again and there is a tentative recovery in the housing market that should accelerate into the rest of this year as interest rates start to fall in the summer, assuming there are no misadventures in the Budget this afternoon. All this should support housing construction.  ‘At the same time, lower inflation and tax cuts will drive increases in real wages further supporting housing affordability. What’s more, lower interest rates, the continued return of office working and stronger business confidence will help commercial development.  ‘There was a little sign that the crisis in the Red Sea is hampering construction efforts with the suppliers’ delivery times index falling to 50.6, indicating that it is becoming harder to get materials, but this is still far above the levels reached during the pandemic-induced supply chain crunch, suggesting that it is not having much of an impact on the industry. ‘Overall, the first half of this year will remain tough, but there are clear signs that the industry is recovering and the outlook is brighter for the second half of 2024 and into 2025.      9.45am GMT  UK construction sector stabilises as housebuilding slump ends  Just in: Activity in the UK’s construction sector contracted slightly last month, while the downturn in housebuilding is bottoming out. In a new healthcheck on the economy ahead of today’s budget, demand conditions across the UK construction sector have improved, due to a pick-up in new orders. The latest poll of purchasing managers at UK building firms has found that, in February:  Total activity fell only fractionally as house building stabilises New work rose for first time since July 2023 Business optimism remained most upbeat since January 2022  All three main categories of construction activity saw a near-stabilisation of business activity in February, data firm S& Global reports. Housebuilding, which has been contracting in recent months, saw the biggest turnaround since January. That may show that hopes of interest rate cuts this year are helping the sector. The PMI index for homebuilding rose to 49.8, up from 44.2, nearly back at the 50-point level that shows stagnation.  House building continued to fall in February 2024 but it was only a marginal monthly fall at 49.8 so it was considerably higher than the 44.2 in January & at its highest level since November 2022 according to S&P Global UK Construction PMI.

Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, says:  “A stabilisation in house building meant that UK construction output was virtually unchanged in February. This was the best performance for the construction sector since August 2023 and the forward-looking survey indicators provide encouragement that business conditions could improve in the coming months. Total new orders expanded for the first time since July 2023, which construction companies attributed to rising client confidence and signs of a turnaround in the residential building segment. Meanwhile, the degree of optimism regarding year ahead business activity prospects was the strongest since the start of 2022, in part due to looser financial conditions and expected interest rate cuts.   Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.27am GMT   UK businesses may not be top of Jeremy Hunt’s priorities today – after all, they can’t vote. But firms are hoping to get something out of the budget – with some pressing the chancellor to drop a planned rise in business rates next month. Back in the autumn statement, Hunt froze business rates for small businesses in England again, and kept a 7% reduction for retail, hospitality and leisure firms, but decided the standard multiplier (setting business rates for larger properties) would rise in April by September’s inflation reading of 6.7%. John Webber, Head of Business Rates at Colliers, warns that firms could collapse unless the burden is eased:   “The Chancellor must cancel the business rates rises due in April for all businesses when he announces his Spring Budget next week, or the High Street will be put under even greater threat than it is already.” says “If the Chancellor does not take action to reduce this rates burden, we will see more retail chains going into administration. Retail, Leisure and Hospitality Relief may have provided a temporary reprieve to the small shopkeeper or independent restaurant but gives no help to the big retail and leisure chains who are the anchor tenants in so many town centres and retail spaces and provide the opportunities for jobs.”      9.09am GMT     Related: What to expect from Jeremy Hunt’s spring budget       9.04am GMT   The flurry of pre-announcements and leaks ahead of today’s budget are quite a contrast with decades gone by. Back in 1947, Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after telling a reporter some juicy details of what he was about to deliver. On his way into the chamber, Dalton told John Carvel of The Star:   “No more on tobacco; a penny on beer; something on dogs and pools but not on horses; increase in purchase tax, but only on articles now taxable; profits tax doubled.”  Unfortunately for Dalton, Carvel got his story published before the budget speech was over, leading to his resignation. Martin Kettle wrote in 2013 that two unusual factors led to Dalton’s indiscretion:  The first was that MPs were still sitting in the House of Lords chamber in 1947 because the House of Commons, badly bombed in the wartime blitz, was still being rebuilt. As a result the chancellor had to walk past lobby journalists on the way to the Lords, a hazard that Osborne does not have to face. The second was that Dalton’s political minder Douglas Jay, who would normally have been on hand to fend off the journalist, had been sent on ahead to check that there was a glass of water at the dispatch box for Dalton during his speech.  The incident had a modern-day repeat eleven years ago, when the London Evening Standard tweeted an image of its front page containing the main announcements prior to George Osborne’s budget statement to parliament…   Related: Budget leak uncanny echo of famous incident from 66 years ago       8.45am GMT  Economist: tax cuts unlikely to close poll gap against Labour  Jeremy Hunt has “played it safe” since taking the reins from Kwasi Kwarteng 17 months ago, says Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg bank. Pickering expects Hunt to stick to his strategy of gradually lowering government spending as a share of GDP. But, he adds, it’s unlikely that modest tax cuts will help the Conservatives close their poll gap against Labour, “who remain on track for a landslide”.  Latest @IpsosUK for @standardnews has the Conservatives falling to 20%, the lowest share Ipsos has ever recorded for them since our regular political monitor series started in the late 1970s. The rest of the data helps explain why.... https://t.co/tfa4McgN6h 1/5 pic.twitter.com/iXY0GJqL3L— Gideon Skinner (@GideonSkinner) March 4, 2024  In a research note, Pickering estimates that Hunt probably has wiggle room of around £20bn-25bn of fiscal headroom, below the. £29.7bn of GDP-adjusted room that past chancellors have aimed for since the OBR was established in 2010.  But the chancellor can’t really spend all that headroom, he says:  To retain credibility, Hunt will need to leave at least some headroom.   The UK also faces “lasting fiscal challenges”, Pickering adds:  Since Hunt became chancellor in October 2022 in the wake of the disastrous Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng September mini-budget, which triggered a serious bout of gilt market turmoil and badly hurt the UK’s credibility, he has played it safe and repeatedly cautioned against risky borrowing. As a result, we expect Hunt to stick to the broad fiscal direction he has set out in all previous plans. That is, a gradual reduction in government spending as a share of GDP alongside a gradual increase in taxes in order to reduce government borrowing to a sustainable level. The plan involves modest increases in stamp duty and corporation taxes as well as tax creep on income as earnings rise but tax brackets remain largely unchanged, alongside restrained spending growth on public services.   Pickering also cautions that tax cuts will probably not dramatically change the economic outlook for the UK, and could encourage the Bank of England to keep interest rates high for longer.  [As the chart above shows], nominal domestic spending (a proxy for demand) has been rising solidly but due to COVID-19 and war-related supply shocks, the UK has struggled to meet demand with sufficient supply – as indicated by stalling real GDP  Better economic performance hinges on a recovery in supply. Tax cuts would boost demand when the situation for households is already improving. Real wages are rising and the labour market is strong. If the Bank of England judges that tax cuts add to inflationary pressures, policymakers may be inclined to cut rates by less this year – de facto neutralising the impact of tax cuts.      8.23am GMT  The budget: What the papers say  Several newspapers splash on the expectations of a 2p cut in national insurance rates in today’s budget.

The plans he set out in November assumed departmental budgets would rise 1% above inflation each year after the election, all of which would be soaked up by protected departments such as health and defence. However, the chancellor is set to reduce that figure to just 0.75%, meaning unprotected areas such as justice and local government would face cuts of up to 20% over the course of the parliament. The plans have sparked concern among some in the Tory party, who point to a series of polls showing that voters would prefer higher public spending and higher taxes than the promise of immediate tax cuts.

Here’s a couple to whet the appetite:  Interactive   Interactive      7.50am GMT  Reeves: Hunt can't undo Conservative's 'economic vandalism'  Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, has accused the government of committing economic vandalism over the last 10 years. Speaking ahead of today’s budget, Reeves says:  “This Budget should be the final chapter of fourteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives that has left Britain worse off. The Conservatives promised to fix the nation’s roof, but instead they have smashed the windows, kicked the door in and are now burning the house down. Taxes are rising, prices are still going up in the shops and we have been hit by recession. Nothing the Chancellor says or does can undo the economic vandalism of the Conservatives over the past decade. The country needs change, not another failed Budget or the risk of five more years of Conservative chaos. Under Keir Starmer’s leadership, the Labour Party has changed and is now the party of economic responsibility. Only Labour has long term plan to deliver more jobs, more investment and to make working people better off.”   Today’s Budget should be the final chapter of fourteen years of Tory economic failure.  Taxes are rising, prices are going up in the shops and we have been hit by recession.  Britain is worse off under the Conservatives. Nothing Jeremy Hunt says or does today can change that.— Rachel Reeves (@RachelReevesMP) March 6, 2024   Five Prime Ministers. Seven Chancellors. Eleven plans for growth.

Booze duty is currently due to rise in August; the Sun says another six-month pause is “a win for our Save Our Sups campaign”, adding:  Fuel duty will also be frozen but it’s bad news for smokers, who face stumping up a record £16 a packet and a new tax on vapes.   Updated at 8.20am GMT    7.38am GMT  FT: Hunt to scrap “non-dom” regime  The Financial Times reports this morning that Jeremy Hunt has decided modernise the colonial-era “non-dom” regime. Ditching the non-dom regime – a move that could potentially raise up to £3bn – has been a policy of the Labour Party for some time. Hunt has previously criticised the idea of abolishing it. But …the FT says that the chancellor is looking to scrap the two-century old concept of domicile. They report:  Hunt will modernise the system, replacing the concept of domicile in tax with a statutory residence test that would define who benefits from a new system of tax privileges. He will also encourage wealthy people to bring their foreign-held assets and money to the UK. Tax experts have long complained the current regime is complicated and disincentivises non-doms from bringing wealth into the country, as they are taxed when they do so.  Back in November 2022, Hunt argued that the non-dom system was good for the UK, as it encouraged the super-wealthy to live and spend here, and that abolishing it could “damage the long-term attractiveness of the UK”.   Related: Abolishing non-dom tax status would be humiliation for Tories, says Phillipson    Updated at 7.47am GMT    7.31am GMT  Introduction: City braces for Budget  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. Eighteen months on from the mini-budget chaos, City investors are hoping for a calmer day today as Jeremy Hunt prepares to present this year’s major fiscal event. Fortunately, a repeat of the market chaos of September 2022 is highly unlikely; while there may be tax cuts announced today, the government is sticking to its (criticised) fiscal goal of showing debt falling in five years time.   Related: The Guardian view on Treasury fiscal rules: no way to run a country | Editorial   Crucially too, the government has also worked with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (a critical step skipped by Kwasi Kwarteng), who will give its verdict once Hunt finishes speaking in parliament today. That should help prevent a crash in the bond market, or in sterling, today. As we covered yesterday, a 2p cut in national insurance rates are expected to be the centre piece of the budget today, as Hunt tries to increase the supply of labour in the economy, and the supply of voters to the Conservatives (Tory MPs, though, would prefer a more eye-catching, but pricier, cut to income tax). Lowering NI by another 2p, on top of the 2p cut last autumn, will save the average worker another £450 – meaning Hunt can say he’s cut tax bills by £900 on average. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, wasn’t too impressed by yesterday’s reports of NI cuts, saying:  It wouldn’t be so much a rabbit pulled out of a hat as a slightly tatty-looking ferret dragged from a box, labelled ‘rabbit’. An income tax cut has been discussed for well over a year. A National Insurance cut would be far better than nothing, but it would be a scaled-down, less attractive option. Jeremy Hunt would just have to hope it didn’t bite.  The decision to freeze income tax thresholds is biting taxpayers; this fiscal drag means more taxpayers are being pulled into paying tax, or into paying tax at a higher rate. Calculations by the Resolution Foundation show that only those paid between £27,000 and £59,000 a year will be better off as a result of both the autumn statement and Wednesday’s budget, once the freeze in thresholds are accounted for. Those paid £16,000 will lose almost £500 a year, as will those receiving more than £60,000. Hunt needs to keep the City onside, as a negative reaction from markets will increase the cost of borrowing for the government. Hal Cook, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warns that the market for UK government debt – or gilts – has been weakening in recent weeks, pushing up the cost of borrowing:  “Gilt markets have been under pressure for some time, due to the combination of high inflation, increasing interest rates, higher levels of government bond issuance post Covid and the Bank of England selling its gilt holdings back to the market. This has made UK gilts less attractive investments compared to cash and the increased supply has also worked against gilt prices.  This increase in borrowing costs has eaten into the chancellor’s fiscal headroom – the amount he can spend without breaking his fiscal rules; it’s thought to be around £13bn. The chancellor is also expected to extend the fuel duty freeze, at a cost of £5bn, which will support the wealthiest.   Related: UK fuel duty cut is regressive policy that benefits the wealthy, study finds   Economists have warned Hunt against making pre-election cuts to tax and spending in the budget, fearing that pre-election giveaways could backfire. Tax rises are also expected today; options include introducing a levy on vaping products, increasing taxes on short-term holiday lets, extending the energy windfall tax and increasing taxes on business-class flights. Hunt has also reportedly considered scrapping Britain’s non-domiciled tax rules, which currently allow foreign domiciled nationals resident in Britain to earn money from capital abroad without paying UK tax on it for up to 15 years. As he presides of an economy currently in a recession, Hunt is expected to present today’s measures as an effort to economic growth. He’ll say:  “Conservatives know lower tax means higher growth. And higher growth means more opportunity and more prosperity…. “Instead of going back to square one, our plans mean more investment, more jobs, more productive public services and lower taxes.”  But his fiscal calculations may also be based on tough limits to public spending after the election, which would put unrealistic pressure on services. Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, warns that the public finances face “big challenges”.  The macro backdrop will likely prove challenging for the Chancellor. A weaker economy will hamper his ability to spend meaningfully in the Spring Budget – despite lower market rate expectations. Falling inflation too will limit the impact of fiscal drag on the Chancellor’s coffers. Challenges around spending cuts pencilled in over the medium-term could also prove unsustainable.

        "content": "The latest GDP figures show that the Reserve Bank has slowed things down so drastically that Australia’s economy, for the first time for 40 years, has gone an entire year where it grew only because of population increases. There really is no good news to find in the December GDP figures. There’s a fair bit of “worst since” about the numbers. Take the overall calendar year. In 2023 Australia produced just 2.0% more than it did in 2022. That is the worst since the lockdown year of 2020 and just the fourth time since the 1990s recession that we did not produce over 2% more than we did the previous year:    If the graph does not display click here On a per capita basis things were truly bad. 2023 was only the third time in the past 40 years that our economy was smaller when accounting for population growth than it had been the year before.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  This is not indicative of things going well. It’s indicative of an economy that has been slowed to a halt by the Reserve Bank.   Related: GDP figures show Australia’s economy grew by just 0.2% in the December quarter   We generally don’t look at total year growth, we focus more on quarterly growth. When we take into account population, Australia’s economy shrunk 0.3% in the December quarter. This was off the back of a 0.5% fall in the September quarter and a 0.2% fall in the June quarter. In the March quarter of last year it didn’t fall. But it didn’t grow either – growth was 0.0%.    If the graph does not display click here But don’t worry, we won’t hear talk of an “official recession” because total GDP in the December quarter went up 0.2%. Cripes. 0.2% is not far off an error term. The economy in the December quarter last year was just 1.5% bigger than it was in the final three months of 2022. That is half the average 3% growth Australia has had since the end of the 1990s recession. The only reason anyone really cares about GDP is because there is a link between growth and unemployment. Historically we need GDP growth of about 2.5% to keep unemployment stable. If GDP grows slower than that, unemployment rises; if we get GDP growth above 2.5%, unemployment falls. So with 1.5% growth, it’s not a shock that unemployment went from 3.5% in December 2022 to 3.9% in December 2023. And remember, this is what the RBA wanted. It predicted this growth in its February Statement on Monetary Policy and, worse, it predicts growth of just 1.3% in the year to June. If it gets its way, expect unemployment to keep rising. So what kept the economy growing at all in the December quarter besides population? Trade mostly – or really our lack of it. Net exports contributed 0.6 percentage points of the 0.2% growth in December. So that means, if you took away our trade, our economy shrank 0.4%. You might think that is because our exports grew. Nope. “Net exports” is exports minus imports. Our exports actually went down in the December quarter, but so too did our imports. We imported 3.4% less stuff in the December quarter than we did in July, August and September. And a big factor was the drop in imported consumer goods – down 5.4%. Australians stopped shopping. And businesses knew this would happen. Three months ago, when looking at the September-quarter figures, I noted that “change in inventories” was the biggest contributor to growth and that was not a good thing “because next quarter we will likely see those inventories run down as businesses decide there is not much point buying more stock given households are not spending”. And, alas, that came true. In the December quarter businesses ran down the stocks of things they had to sell – because why bother building up stocks when you know people aren’t buying? This reduced GDP by 0.3%pts in the December quarter:    If the graph does not display click here If you take away trade and government spending, Australia’s domestic private sector fell 0.5% in the December quarter. That is not healthy. And we all know it. Household consumption grew a measly 0.1% in the December quarter. And what we bought was mostly essential items – food and groceries and paying off bills. Our spending on discretionary items (those things we can do without) fell 0.9%.    If the graph does not display click here That’s a direct result of interest rate rises. And it has meant even though average household disposable income finally rose again, we did not feel like we were doing OK.    If the graph does not display click here Partly this is because the increase came after a long fall, and we’re only back where we were in 2015 (although it is worth remembering that from 2015 to 2019 household living standards barely rose). But it is also due to what drove the increase in living standards. Partly it was an increase in wages but also an increase in the value of housing and the incomes investors received from their properties. That is not exactly a wide scope of the nation. There was also an increase in social assistance and a reduction in the level of tax being paid, although this is not as great as it sounds. The Bureau of Statistics noted this was due to “changed timing of final tax return submissions compared to previous years”.    If the graph does not display click here And so we find ourselves bidding goodbye to the 2023 economy, and the knowledge that we ended the year with a weak economy teetering on the brink of recession, with essentially only population growth keeping things going. We should remember that the Reserve Bank decided in November to increase interest rates one more time, just when this economy was struggling, just as households were cutting back on buying discretionary items and just as unemployment was rising. The Reserve Bank assured us it was aware of the risks of slowing the economy too harshly. Right now it should be very worried indeed. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

        "content": "The UK business of the fast-fashion company Shein has failed to disclose its ultimate ownership, a breach of company law that could disrupt the firm’s reported plans to consider listing in the UK. UK companies are legally required to declare their ultimate human beneficial owner – their “person with significant control” (PSC). However, Shein Distribution UK Ltd’s filing with Companies House lists Roadget Business Pte Ltd, based in Singapore, as its PSC and not an individual. The issue was spotted by Dan Neidle, the founder of Tax Policy Associates, a thinktank established to improve UK tax and legal policy, who said that knowingly or recklessly making a false or misleading filing would be a criminal offence. He called on Companies House to build a system that could automatically reject clearly unlawful filings. Shein said: “We are grateful that this has been brought to our attention. Unfortunately, this error was not identified in the company’s registration process. We are currently working to rectify this.” Shein, which was founded in China in 2008 by the billionaire Chris Xu and whose headquarters are in Singapore, is famous for its ultra-cheap clothing such as bike shorts, crop tops and bikinis, and has previously been associated with celebrities including Katy Perry and Rita Ora. The company has risen from relative obscurity to dominate the fast-fashion market, and was most recently valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a March 2023 fundraising round, down from $100bn in 2022. It has faced allegations of labour abuse and in late 2022 it pledged to invest in improving standards at its supplier factories. Shein’s UK business made £1.1bn in sales last year, and a pre-tax profit of £12.2m in the 16 months to 31 December 2022, according to documents filed with Companies House. Globally, the group made $30bn in revenues last year. Shein is reportedly in the early stages of exploring a London listing because it believes it is unlikely that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would approve its initial public offering (IPO). If it were to go ahead, it would be one of London’s biggest ever corporate listings and a boost to the country’s reputation as an international financial centre, after a number of companies including the British chipmaker Arm opted for the Nasdaq in New York, despite the UK government’s efforts to persuade more firms to list in London. This week, Companies House received greater powers to tackle factually inaccurate information on its register and crack down on abuse, hailed by its chief executive, Louise Smyth, as the biggest shake-up in its 180-year history. Companies House said it did not comment on individual companies. It said failure to provide accurate information on the PSC register and failure to comply with notices requiring someone to provide information were criminal offences, adding that evidence of anomalies was fully investigated and appropriate action taken. Under company law, a relevant legal entity, a corporate body that owns or controls a company, can be registered as a PSC if it is the first relevant legal entity in that company’s ownership chain and keeps its own PSC register, is subject to the Financial Conduct Authority’s disclosure rules, and has voting shares admitted to trading on a regulated market in the UK or Europe, Switzerland, the US, Japan and Israel. Neidle said: “This isn’t good enough. The filing is clearly wrong on its face. Identifying such errors automatically isn’t a difficult task, but it looks like Companies House doesn’t even try.”"

        "content": "British Airways is to offer free instant messaging on most flights and a new app to allow customers to automatically book alternative travel in cases of disruption, as part of a £7bn overhaul to spruce up the national carrier. Passengers on planes with wifi – about 80% of the Heathrow fleet, plus all of the smaller Gatwick operation – will from next month be able to send texts on services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger free of charge during the flight. Currently passengers have to pay a small fee to use basic wifi services, but all who sign up to the airline’s free loyalty club will be able to use text messaging services – although not make calls or send images – without charge. The airline is also bringing in new seating and lounges for premium customers and spending £750m to modernise its creaky IT system. The overhaul follows criticism from frequent flyers, after elements of BA’s service were pared back to compete with budget airlines, even before the cost-cutting and loss of staff in the pandemic. The airline’s chief executive, Sean Doyle, said it was “on a journey to a better BA”. The airline said all its aircraft should have inflight wifi by the end of 2025. Although other “full-service” global carriers such as KLM and Lufthansa already offer free messaging, BA hopes it will be a point of difference from its biggest UK short-haul competitors, easyJet and Ryanair. BA has unveiled new seats for its short-haul fleet, to be introduced when new Airbus planes arrive from May, fitted with better and more accessible charging ports. In its premium Club Europe seats it is bringing back a bespoke leather tray that straddles the vacant middle seat for extra comfort. Much of the £7bn investment, announced alongside rebounding profits last week, will be in new, more fuel-efficient planes, but a significant sum will be spent on back-end IT and improvements to the public website and app. One change, coming at the end of 2024, is to allow customers to make their own rebookings in times of disruption, should they wish, including for other airlines and emergency hotels. Passengers have often complained of long wait times to reach call centres during occasional mass disruption. Doyle said the investment would also address resilience at Heathrow, using AI to predict delays and speed up operations, as well as hiring a further 350 people to work in customer service. He said: “We’re going to take delivery of new aircraft, introduce new cabins, elevate our customer care, focus on operational performance and address our environmental impact by reducing our emissions and creating a culture of sustainability … we are laser-focused on transforming our business and fixing any pain points for our customers.” The airline will also start direct flights in autumn to two popular Asian destinations, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, which were dropped from its network during the Covid pandemic."

        "content": "Southend airport is to pass into the control of the US private-equity group Carlyle after an agreement to settle a debt, in the latest takeover of a UK firm by a foreign company. The London-listed aviation group Esken, formerly Stobart Group, said it had reached a deal over the £193.75m debt that its subsidiary London Southend airport owed to Carlyle Global Infrastructure Fund (CGI). Under the deal, CGI will take an 82.5% stake in the Essex-based airport, while Esken will keep a 17.5% stake. Esken’s shares will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange as part of the process, and shareholders will be left empty-handed.   Related: With weeds on the forecourt, a deserted Southend airport looks to the future   “The expectation is that any return for shareholders at the end of the process is likely to be negligible,” Esken said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. The deal, agreed with the board of the airport, includes a short-term unsecured £5m bridge loan to the hub as part of a commitment of £32m of new funding to secure its future growth. Esken said it had opted for the restructuring because it lacked the financial resources to fight a protracted court battle. The restructuring will require a court process. It added: “The court process for the Esken restructuring plan is likely to take several months to conclude but, in the meantime, the future funding of London Southend airport is secure and the board will progress the orderly wind down of the remaining group.” The deal also involves Cyrus Capital Partners, a London-based private-equity firm, which holds a £53m bond that matures on 8 May, and will provide liquidity to the Esken group during this process. The airport’s chief executive, John Upton, previously said Carlyle and Cyrus had “extensive experience across the aviation industry and deep knowledge of our airport”. The news comes a day after the UK telecoms firm Spirent Communications accepted a £1bn offer from a US rival, Arizona-based Viavi Solutions. There has been a flurry of takeover offers for British companies from foreign suitors hoping to take advantage of low valuations. UK assets are considered to be cheap, weighed down by a weaker pound, the struggling economy and lingering impact of Brexit. Southend was redeveloped with soaring ambition a decade ago, and appeared likely to grow exponentially among airports that service London, as airlines including easyJet and Ryanair established bases there. But then the Covid-19 outbreak brought international travel to an abrupt halt in 2020. In 2021, as the pandemic continued to weigh on travel, the company borrowed £125m from Carlyle to secure its finances through the crisis. Carlyle later claimed Esken had broken the terms of its loan and asked for £200m back. The latest deal will settle that dispute."

        "content": "Australia’s economy eked out modest growth at the end of 2023 as consumers drew down savings to keep spending, fuelling hopes of a near-term rebound as inflation ebbs, tax cuts arrive and the Reserve Bank starts cutting interest rates. The country’s gross domestic product in the December quarter posted a 0.2% rise compared with the previous three months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday. At an annual rate, GDP rose 1.5%. Economists had expected quarterly growth to maintain at its 0.2% pace in the final three months of 2023. Compared with a year earlier, they expected 1.5% growth – also matching the official outcome.   Related: The Sofronoff saga has shattered whatever confidence we had in our legal system. Here’s what went wrong | Geoffrey Watson   The September quarter’s growth pace was revised higher to 0.3%. As a result, GDP slowed has slowed for the past five quarters but has remained positive since the September quarter of 2021. As expected, a rise in exports and a drop in imports contributed the most to the quarterly growth tally, at 0.6 percentage points. A drop in stocks held by companies shaved 0.3% to be the main drag. Households managed to increase overall spending 0.1% while cutting back on discretionary outlays. Rising income and additional government spending on benefits also helped lift the household saving-to-income ratio to 3.2% – ending two years of falls. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had been preparing the public for “quite weak” economic growth from the December quarter, a period that included the RBA’s 13th and possibly last interest rate rise since it began hiking the cash rate in May 2022. “Addressing inflation is still our primary concern,” Chalmers said. “But these numbers show that the balance of risks in our economy is shifting from inflation to growth.” The headline growth figure, though, has been buoyed by Australia’s swelling population. Including the December quarter, per capita has been flat or falling for each of the past four quarters, and was 1% lower for the year.  As with other rich nations, Australia has been stabilising after the Covid pandemic initially sent the economy into a tailspin then a sharp recovery as stimulus spending kicked in. Disruptions to supply chains sparked a jump in prices made worse by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Australia’s 1.5% annual GDP growth compared favourably with many other rich nations. The US clocked 3.1% growth in 2023, while the Euro-area posted 0.1% growth, Canada 0.5% and Japan 1%. The UK’s economy shrank 0.2% last year, according to Economist data. The RBA wants to bring inflation back to its 2%-3% target range over time with higher interest rates while retaining most of the surge in employment. A too-rapid slowdown in the economy, though, will foster more criticism that its November rate rise was excessive. The central bank’s latest forecasts, released last month, assumed GDP growth in the December quarter would come in at 1.5%. It will slower further to 1.3% by June before quickening to 1.8% by the end of 2024. Market reaction was limited as the GDP figures were largely as expected. The dollar remained at about 65 US cents and stocks were holding on to modest losses during morning trade. Deloitte Access Economics partner Stephen Smith said “Australia is not in recession but many Australians are”. “Excluding the pandemic and the impact of the GST, this is the slowest rate of economic growth since the recession of the early 1990s,” Smith said, adding that Wednesday’s figures were “further evidence that the November 2023 interest rate hike by the RBA was unnecessary”. “Another rate rise would cruel the economy – and Deloitte Access Economics expects to see 100 basis points of cuts in 2024-25,” he said. “Monetary and fiscal policy need to pivot away from containing inflation to stimulating economic growth.” Private business investment rose 0.7% in the December quarter, driven 5% higher by non-dwelling construction, the ABS said. Firms, though, cut spending on machinery and equipment by 1.3%, the first drop since September 2022 with farmers leading the retreat. Public investment was also a drag on growth, declining 0.2% also for the first quarterly drop since the July-September quarter of 2022, the ABS said."

        "published_date": "2024-03-05T23:59:35+00:00",
        "content": "Four of the world’s biggest banks have left the Equator Principles, a set of minimum industry standards and safeguards for financial institutions to address environmental and social risks in countries where they finance fossil fuel and mining projects.   Related: ‘We are the guinea pigs’: Arizona mining project sparks concerns for air and water   The Equator Principles have been around for more than two decades, and while not enforceable, they provide a basic framework of environmental standards that banks agreed would underpin financing deals on pollution-causing extractive projects. The American banks – Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo – are listed as having left the group of institutions that have signed the principles. The news was condemned by climate groups as “shocking” and “cowardly”. “It is a very troubling move by some of the biggest fossil fuel financing banks in the world to abandon a bare minimum set of standards that banks themselves have set. It is both ethically shocking and financially irresponsible. It is becoming increasingly apparent these banks do not care about anything other than the bottom line,” said Richard Brooks, the climate finance director at Stand.earth. “This is yet another display of cowardice that shows how Wall Street is bending to pressure from climate-denier extremists rather than upholding some of their most basic climate and human rights commitments,” said Adele Shraiman, the Sierra Club’s fossil-free finance campaign senior strategist. Spokespeople for the four banks all said they would continue to be informed by those principles, Reuters reported. But the banks’ names have been removed from the Equator Principles list, which now includes 10 standards for aspects of projects ranging from initial due diligence to grievance mechanisms. The move is part of an alarming trend among banks headquartered in the US of backpedaling on commitments on the climate and to vulnerable communities affected by their financing deals. Republican states have increasingly targeted “woke capitalism” and moved to pass laws to boycott banks and investors that embrace environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was once a vocal champion of ESG, but now talks about “transition investing”. Bank of America has removed explicit bans on financing coal and Arctic drilling projects. JPMorgan Chase has introduced an “energy mix” for calculating its financed emissions, which will include renewable energy and make it harder to assess the environmental impact of projects. The banks’ departure from the environmental standards benchmark is the latest example of major financial services companies leaving corporate environmental initiatives since US Republican politicians started suggesting participation could breach antitrust rules. It’s unclear what impact the withdrawals will have, given that the banks in question are already the biggest funders of oil, gas and coal in the world, investing $1.4tn in fossil fuel projects globally between 2016 and 2022. “The silent retreat from major US banks which are among the biggest financiers of fossil fuels globally from this initiative is deeply concerning,” said Aditi Sen, the climate and energy director at Rainforest Action Network. “It further undermines the rights of frontline and fence-line communities across the world who bear the brunt of impacts from toxic projects.”"

        "content": "The price of gold has hit a record high amid investor jitters over tensions in the Middle East and speculation that US interest rates will be cut by the summer. Investors piled into the “safe haven” asset on Tuesday, with the spot price reaching a record $2,141.59 (about £1,685) for an ounce, beating the previous record of $2,135 in December, before easing back again to about $2,128. The US Federal Reserve is increasingly expected to cut interest rates – now at 23-year highs – in June. Reductions in borrowing costs typically push gold higher because it does not offer any interest. The precious metal is also used as a reliable store of value during periods of political and financial uncertainty. It has risen by more than $300 an ounce since the start of the Israel-Hamas war and some analysts believe it could break the $2,300 mark. Ricardo Evangelista, a senior analyst at ActivTrades, said: “Concerns surrounding global economic prospects, geopolitical tensions, and shifting expectations towards earlier interest rate cuts have fuelled increased demand for the precious metal, leading to its upward price trajectory.” Patrick Farrell, the chief investment officer at Charles Stanley, argued that the gold price would probably soon peak. He said: “It has been a grim year for many commodities. A confluence of weakening economic growth, particularly from China, plus an adjustment after some post-pandemic exuberance, has seen the prices for energy, industrial metals and ‘energy transition’ commodities such as copper and nickel drop. “Gold, in contrast, has reached new highs as geopolitical tensions have increased. This situation may be about to reverse.” Farrell said those tensions were now “priced in” to the current gold price, and that returns on other investments were rising, meaning gold would fall. The pile into gold comes despite a lack of endorsement from one of the world’s best-known investors. In a speech at Harvard in 1998, Warren Buffett said gold “gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.” Russ Mould, the AJ Bell investment director, noted Buffett’s argument, and added: “Unusually, the market is shrugging off the Sage of Omaha’s words of wisdom and embracing gold instead.” While commodities such as gas have fallen this year, investors have put funds behind other assets including bitcoin – which has also reached a record, breaking $69,000 on Tuesday – and overseas stock markets, driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The FTSE 100 has missed out on the rally, as it has few technology stocks."

        "content": "Bitcoin, gold, the US stock market, the German stock market, even the Japanese stock market after 34 long years. Is there anything not hitting all-times? Well, there’s the tech-lite FTSE 100 index, still plodding along 500 points below its high of early last year, but it’s an outlier. The rest of the investment world is feeling the adrenalin rush of interest rate cuts in the offing and talking about the revolution in artificial intelligence. At which point, it’s worth asking whether this is all getting a bit speculative. Isn’t excitement over the transformative effects of AI, which won’t happen overnight, already overdone? The S&P 500 index has been hitting new highs in most weeks this year and is up 27% over 12 months. As is well-known by now, by far the largest contribution has come from six of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks – Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) Microsoft and, especially, chipmaker Nvidia. (Tesla, the other member of the group, is the laggard). New highs for stock market indices tell us little in themselves, of course. Schroders’ strategists recently crunched the numbers on the US market since 1926 and showed that all-times highs were seen in 30% of months. Yet Marko Kolanović, JP Morgan’s chief market strategist, was also expressing a widely-held worry on Tuesday when he wrote: “Stocks continuing to push to new record highs and Bitcoin surging over $60k may indicate accumulating froth in the market.” The phrase “accumulating froth” is nicely nuanced since it includes the possibility that current conditions could last a lot longer. But the concentration in the group of US leaders, which now make up 25% of the US market, is so extreme that we have, in effect, two markets. The Magnificent Seven have just produced a collective 56% increase in earnings in their latest reporting periods, noted Kolanović, while the rest of the S&P 500’s companies were down 2% in aggregate. “So currently, we have the uncomfortable choice of buying something already expensive, albeit with good earnings growth, or something cheap, perhaps justifiably so with negative earnings growth.” It’s not obviously an appealing choice. Within the group of Seven, Nvidia is a tale in itself. It’s up 75% this year – yes, since the start of January – after a 230% gain in 2023. Its market capitalisation is now over $2tn, so more than both Alphabet and Amazon. And it’s predicated on the thesis that Nvidia’s processing chips will be the essential ingredient for running generative AI models. Chief executive, Jensen Huang, spoke last month about AI hitting “a tipping point” with surging demand “across companies, industries and nations”. Few would quibble with the tipping point analysis: the AI revolution is clearly real, just as the internet-inspired transformation of the economy was 25 years ago. But the investment question – less discussed – is surely whether the current leaders will have the field to themselves. Terry Smith, manager of the Fundsmith fund, made an excellent point in his recent report to investors when he said it would be “a break with tradition” if the stock market has been able to identify the winners from AI in advance. He pointed to a long list of early leaders that tripped up last time in the dotcom era: AOL in internet service provision; Nokia in mobile phones; Yahoo in search engines; and Research In Motion, aka Blackberry, in smartphones. It is also possible, Smith suggested, that there won’t be a single winner, either in the provision of large language models or their use, because there’s no shortage of contenders. “The adoption of AI may lead to a situation where everyone has it, so no one has any advantage,” he argued. Yes, that is also possible. Such scepticism is not the mood of the market at the moment, however. We are at the stage where the only part of the story that resonates is the fact that the changes will be enormous. It’s a simple thesis, which is partly why it is compelling. Trying to call the top is a mug’s game, so there’s no point trying (Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan made his famous remarks about “irrational exuberance” in December 1996, a full three years before the dotcom bubble finally burst). But, yes, it’s starting to feel frothy."

Jeremy Hunt is to cut national insurance by 2p in his budget on Wednesday, the Guardian understands, in a move designed to offer voters a pre-election giveaway but which could mean steeper spending cuts after the election. The UK chancellor is preparing to announce the second big cut to employment taxes in a year, after his decision to cut national insurance rates by 2p at last year’s autumn statement. Wednesday’s move should save the average earner £450 a year, which combined with last year’s cut will add up to £900. However, the chancellor has been looking at further public spending cuts after the election as one way to pay for the tax reduction, despite economists’ warnings that such a move would cause public services to buckle. Hunt and the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, have spent the last few weeks looking for ways to offer a tax cut on the scale of that announced last year as a way to boost the Conservatives’ flagging poll ratings in their last budget before an election.

And today’s record high comes just a few hours after actual gold also hit a record high. The spot price of gold traded as high as $2,141 per ounce today,  AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says gold is benefiting from increases in government debt around the globe, but particularly in the USA.  “It is unfashionable to focus on gold, especially when the Magnificent Seven are doing so much to propel US equities to new highs (or at least five of them are, anyway), and it is easy to dismiss the case for including the precious metal in even the most balanced of portfolios. As Warren Buffett succinctly put it in a speech he gave at Harvard in 1998, ‘Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.’ “Yet, unusually, the market is shrugging off the Sage of Omaha’s words of wisdom and embracing gold instead. Its rise to new highs even means that in capital terms it has matched strides with the much more widely lauded S&P 500 index since the start of 1971, the year when President Richard M.

That would have a combined cost of about £12bn; more than the £10bn for lopping 2p off national insurance,. The attraction is that voters might appreciate a cut to income tax rather than national insurance (which is a tax on earned income).

That freeze is causing significant ‘fiscal drag’, as rising wages push more people into tax higher bands.  Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  “Reports suggest Jeremy Hunt has decided to cut National Insurance by 2p in the Budget. It wouldn’t be so much a rabbit pulled out of a hat as a slightly tatty-looking ferret dragged from a box, labelled ‘rabbit’. An income tax cut has been discussed for well over a year. A National Insurance cut would be far better than nothing, but it would be a scaled-down, less attractive option. Jeremy Hunt would just have to hope it didn’t bite. With taxes swallowing such a massive proportion of GDP, any tax cut would be welcome. This one would save us an average of £450 a year. And while the biggest savings would be reserved for those earning more, every saving helps at a time when our own budgets are stretched so thin. t’s easy to see why this may have pipped income tax to the post in the race for Budget tax cuts, because it’s much cheaper. A 2p cut would cost about £10 billion, which is more manageable for a Chancellor with shrinking headroom. However, the price Hunt would pay for opting for NI is clear. It would benefit fewer people. 27 million workers would pocket a tax cut, but millions more wouldn’t, because it wouldn’t affect the tax on pensions, and income from savings and investments like property. It means an awful lot of voters would get no benefit from the change.   Full marks, @HLInvest “Reports suggest Jeremy Hunt has decided to cut National Insurance by 2p in the Budget. It wouldn’t be so much a rabbit pulled out of a hat as a slightly tatty-looking ferret dragged from a box, labelled ‘rabbit’\"— This writing business. Overrated if you ask me. (@ScouseView) March 5, 2024  Coles also points out that January’s cut to National Insurance hasn’t made a dramatic difference in the polls:  It may be that Jeremy Hunt has decided this is all he can afford to offer right now. The question will be whether it’s a enough of a blockbuster tax cut to move the dial on a general election. Unfortunately, if NI is cut, it’s not as good as it may sound, because it would come at the same time as yet another freeze in the personal allowance and the higher rate tax threshold, which the OBR says will see 1.1 million more people dragged into paying income tax and 800,000 more forced to pay higher rate tax. It means the government would be giving with one hand and taking away with the other.”      1.29pm GMT  King Charles and Jeremy Hunt pictured together ahead of Budget  The King has held an in-person pre-Budget audience with Jeremy Hunt at Buckingham Palace today, ahead of tomorrow’s fiscal event. It’s traditional that before a Budget is presented, the Chancellor of the Exchequer meets with the monarch, usually the day before the Government’s plans for the economy are delivered in a statement to the Commons (at 12.30pm tomorrow).  Updated at 1.36pm GMT    1.23pm GMT   Sky News are also reporting that the chancellor will cut national insurance by a further 2p in the pound in the budget tomorrow. Their political correspondent, Matthew Thompson, says a debate has been “raging” inside Downing Street for the last few weeks about whether to cut NI rates or income tax. There are two reasons why NI has been chosen, Thompson says. One, it’s cheaper, as only paid by those in work, not those who are retired. Two, this meant is is less inflationary. But, he adds, an income tax cut is potentially the better option politicially, as people understand it more. There is a fear within the government that they may not get “the political dividends they’re looking for” through a NI cut, Thompson adds – after all, Hunt announced a 2p cut in the autumn statement, and the Conservatives are still lagging well behind in the polls.  BREAKING: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will cut national insurance by two percentage points in the spring budget, Sky News understands.Sky's @mattuthompson has the latestMore on Politics Hub ➡️ https://t.co/5KXgeTqXxl📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube pic.twitter.com/5OOrZK8aim— Sky News (@SkyNews) March 5, 2024      1.13pm GMT   Yahoo Finance have details on what a 2 percentage point cut to national insurance would mean in practice:   Employees and self-employed workers currently pay 10% on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 in Class 1 national insurance contributions. This was reduced from 12% of earnings in the autumn statement, although the threshold to start paying — £12,570 — is frozen until 2028. Analysis by the investment platform AJ Bell reveals that cutting the national insurance rate by two percentage points from 10% to 8% would be worth almost £250 to someone on a yearly salary of £25,000, with a maximum saving of £754.      12.59pm GMT   Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning expert at City firm Quilter, says:  It looks like Chancellor Jeremey Hunt has opted for the cheaper and potentially less headline grabbing option of cutting national insurance by a further 2%. This means that millions of hard-working Britons will see more money in their pockets every month, as the government tries to ease the pressure of the highest tax burden in decades. While a cut in taxes will for some be a needed boost, it hardly turns the dial much considering we are dealing with a historic tax burden at present. However, it will certainly be a crowd pleaser with someone earning £30,000 a year being around £58 better off a month if you also take into account the national insurance cuts in the Autumn Statement. However, many people don’t understand how national insurance works and a cut to income tax would have been easier for all to understand but crucially much more expensive      12.35pm GMT   After the budget tomorrow, the Office for Budget Responsibility will give its verdict, alongside its latest forecasts for economic growth, borrowing, inflation and unemployment. Economists predict a slightly downgrade to the OBR’s short-term growth prediction, PA Media reports. In its previous forecast in November, the OBR had predicted 0.6% growth in GDP for 2023, with 0.7% growth in 2024. However, last year the UK economy ultimately fell short of this, with 0.1% growth in GDP, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was lower than expected after a contraction over the final half of 2023, which also meant the UK was in a technical recession. Economists expect the UK to swiftly return to growth after the recession but widely predict subdued growth in 2024, with projections below the OBR’s previous forecast. Experts at Pantheon Macroeconomics and Oxford Economics are both expecting 0.4% growth in 2024. Pantheon said it expects lower-than-expected growth to cut tax revenues by around £4bn this year, although this is expected to dissipate over the next five years.     12.19pm GMT   UK government bond prices are strengthening today, an indication that City traders are not too anxious about tomorrow’s budget.

The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank has calculated that nearly half the benefit would go to the richest 20% of households, while just 3% would end up in the pocket of the poorest fifth of us.  If the chancellor were to cut 2p off National Insurance contributions at the Budget, this would cost £10.4bn in 2024/25.Londoners would benefit the most (£608 on average), while those in the North East would get less than £1 per day (£342 on average). pic.twitter.com/SrxFBmPjN6— IPPR (@IPPR) March 5, 2024   What's more, for every £1 the government spends on NICs cuts, 46p goes to the richest households and just 3p to the poorest pic.twitter.com/2QY6FN7l7V— George Dibb (@GeorgeDibb) March 5, 2024   Updated at 1.14pm GMT    11.36am GMT   Jeremy Hunt is also contrained by fears that the financial markets could wobble if he risks unfunded tax cuts. Mike Coop, chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management Europe, says investors could push up UK borrowing costs if Jeremy Hunt takes risks:  “We see very limited scope for any sizeable tax, spending, borrowing, or regulatory changes and hence expect a muted economic and market impact. The government is severely hemmed in by a ferocious foursome of big debt, anaemic growth, threadbare public services, and high tax rates. Markets have put the government on a short leash after the Truss mini-budget so any giveaways based on heroic assumptions about future growth and spending cuts will risk a rise in interest rates, no matter how politically compelling in an election year when Reform UK is on the rise.  “There is scope for funding up to £15 billion of tax cuts and spending increases due to shifts in inflation, interest rates and tax receipts compared to prior forecasts, though the government may choose to keep some dry powder for the Autumn Statement just prior to an election.      11.25am GMT   UK budgets get far more attention than they really deserve, argues Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg bank. For two reasons, this is probably the case for tomorrow’s performance, he explains:  First, the government simply does not have the fiscal headroom to give the economy a big shot in the arm. Second, as power is likely to shift to Labour later this year, at best, tomorrow’s announcements may be valid for between six to nine months before the five-year plans are torn up and rewritten by the next (likely Labour) chancellor.  That limited ‘fiscal headroom’ is measured against the government’s aim to have debt falling as a share of the economy in five years time – a “ludicrous target”, according to Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  \"It's ludicrous that we should be thinking about whether we will or won't cut taxes [...] off the back of some very uncertain forecasts about what might or might not be happening five years hence.\"📺 @PJTheEconomist on the gaming of fiscal rules: https://t.co/fYPnQr1A6V pic.twitter.com/D7d9GFKwdU— Institute for Fiscal Studies (@TheIFS) March 4, 2024  See here for more on the fiscal rules:   Related: What are the UK’s ‘fiscal rules’ and why is the OBR under attack?   Pickering also warns that while household-friendly tax cuts may help lift support for the Conservatives, they probably won’t dramatically change the economic outlook for the UK. He says:  Nominal domestic spending (a proxy for demand) has been rising solidly but due to COVID-19 and war-related supply shocks, the UK has struggled to meet demand with sufficient supply – as indicated by stalling real GDP. Better economic performance hinges on a recovery in supply. Tax cuts would boost demand when the situation for households is already improving. Real wages are rising and the labour market is strong. If the Bank of England judges that tax cuts add to inflationary pressures, policymakers may be inclined to cut rates by less this year – de facto neutralising the impact of tax cuts.   Updated at 12.01pm GMT    11.00am GMT   Steven Swinford also explains why cutting national insurance is cheaper than a cut to income tax:  Cutting income tax is significantly more expensive as it benefits both workers and pensioners. A cut of two percentage points in employee national insurance costs about £10 billion a year, while a 2p cut in income tax would cost £13.7 billion a year. There are also concerns that cutting income tax would be inflationary.  More here (£).  Updated at 3.53pm GMT    10.47am GMT  Jeremy Hunt 'will cut national insurance by 2p in the budget'  Back in the political world, Steven Swinford of The Times reports that tomorrow’s budget will include a national insurance cut of two percentage points.

Our Politics Live blog has all the latest from Westminster:   Related: Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth makes bet in TV interview that Sunak will call general election in May – UK politics live    Updated at 3.53pm GMT    10.37am GMT  UK PMIs: what the experts say  February’s healthcheck on UK purchasing managers shows the services sector achieving continued growth, says Jenny Etherton, Director at PwC UK:  “The UK services sector is showing considerable resilience, with the PMI posting 53.8 in February - growing for the fourth consecutive month. “Buoyed by new demand, especially from the US and Asia, services firms have been able to increase their prices and pass on rises in both wages and shipping costs to customers. “Anticipation of lower interest rates, possibly materialising sooner than expected, has contributed to the growth of both business and consumer confidence. Despite the continued uncertainty around global economic and geopolitical conditions, almost 60% of the PMI’s survey panel expect business activity to rise in the coming year.  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, points out that today’s PMI readings aren’t quite as strong as the flash readings taken during February. She’s aso concerned that retail sales were weak last month (see opening post), which has been blamed on bad weather:  There was some signs of a softening in the UK economic data for last month. The BRC like for like retail sales report for February was weaker than expected, rising by 1%, down from 1.4% in January, and lower than the 1.6% expected. The UK services PMI was also revised lower for February, to 53.8, vs. 54.3 initially. This also lowered the final composite PMI reading for February, which fell to 53, from 53.3. This is still the highest reading since May 2023, and new orders also rose last rose month, which is a sign that the economy remains strong. Overall, the February PMI surveys are still in expansionary territory, and they suggest that the UK economy bounced back in Q1, but maybe not as much as initially expected.      10.17am GMT   The UK economy outperformed the eurozone last month, although conditions are also improving across the channel. S&P Global reports that the eurozone economy moved “closer to stabilisation in February” as the service sector returned to growth, for the first time since last July. Overall, the eurozone private sector shrank again with the composite PMI Output Index coming in at 49.2. That’s up from January’s 47.9, but still below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. The services PMI business activity index crept over that 50-point mark, rising to 50.2 in February from 48.4 in January. Southern European countries are driving the recovery. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, explains:  “The [eurozone] service sector may be off to a better start in 2024 than anticipated. For the first time in seven months, the sector’s activity is expanding instead of shrinking. While the growth rate is fractional, it is complemented by positive developments in other PMI sub-indicators.  Particularly encouraging is the uptick in new staff recruitment by service providers, surpassing the sluggish growth rates seen in recent months. Moreover, the stability in incoming new business suggests a potential turning point in demand conditions. Economic vitality in the Eurozone’s service sector stemmed predominantly in the South. Spain and Italy marked their sixth and second consecutive months of rising service sector activity, respectively, a contrast with Germany and France, where contractions continued.

The S&P Global composite Purchasing Managers Index, which tracks activity at services companies and manufacturers, has risen to 53.0 in February, up from 52.9 in January. That shows a pick-up in growth, with service sector companies reporting a sustained increase in business activity last month, with the fastest rise in new work since May 2023. Improving export sales helped to boost total order books in February, today’s services PMI report shows. While output growth at service sector firms softened slightly in February, growth forecasts were the most upbeat since February 2022. It suggests that the shallow recession that began at the end of 2023 may be ending, which should cheer the chancellor ahead of tomorrow’s budget. Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, explains:  “Another solid expansion of business activity across the service sector in February adds to signs that the UK economy has turned a corner after entering a technical recession during the second half of 2023. New business intakes were a particularly bright spot as service providers reported the fastest order book growth since May 2023. Survey respondents cited rising business and consumer spending, linked to improved optimism towards the broader economic outlook. Resilient export sales also provided support to service sector growth, as signalled by the strongest rise in new work from abroad for eight months.  BUT…. firms also reported that cost pressures have not abated. The PMI report says:  On the inflation front, latest data indicated the strongest rise in input costs across the UK private sector since August 2023. Inflationary pressures intensified in both the manufacturing and service sectors in February, with the latter again posting a much faster overall rise in business expenses.   Updated at 9.56am GMT    9.21am GMT   UK car dealers are also urging Jeremy Hunt to provide more incentives for people to buy electric cars, in tomorrow’s budget. Following the news that UK car sales jumped in February, due to business customers, Sue Robinson, chief executive of the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA), says:  “It is promising to see that electric sales continue to grow after a bounce back last month, particularly as OEMs seek to meet the targets set by the ZEV mandate for this year. In recent months, this has primarily been driven by fleet rather than private demand.  “In spite of encouraging progress, it is crucial that the Government continues to work with dealers to attain the best outcomes for consumers. “The Spring Budget provides a prime opportunity for the Government to keep this momentum going. NFDA urged the Government, in its Spring Budget submission, to increase consumer confidence in EVs through price incentives and improving electric charging infrastructure. NFDA also stressed to the Government to prioritise investment and growth in the UK automotive sector.”      9.11am GMT  UK's new car market records best February for 20 years  It’s official: UK car sales hit a 20-year high for a February last month, driven by business customers. There were 84,886 new car registrations last month, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has just reported. That’s a 14% increase on last year, and the best performance for any February since 2004. But…… this growth is being driven by business customers, expanding their fleets of cars. Sales to private buyers dropped by 2.6%. The SMMT says:  It was the 19th month of consecutive growth, which has primarily been driven by fleets investing in the latest vehicles. Indeed, fleets and businesses were responsible for the entirety of February’s increase, with registrations up 25.2% and 15.5% respectively. Private uptake continued to struggle, with a -2.6% decline to record a 33.7% market share. February is traditionally volatile as the lowest volume month of the year, with buyers often electing to wait until March and the new number plate.

As flagged earlier, the SMMT is also urging the chancellor to cut taxes on new electric cars, and lower the tax on public EV charging. The group says:  While consumers do not pay VAT on other emission reduction technologies such as heat pumps and solar panels, private EV buyers pay the full 20% levied on all cars, whether they be electric, petrol or diesel. Halving VAT on new EV purchases would save the average buyer around £4,000 off the upfront purchase price – yet cost the Treasury less than the Plug-in Car Grant that was scrapped in 2022.2      8.38am GMT   Shares in Greggs have jumped 2.5% in early trading, after it reported a 27% rise in profits this morning (see 7.47am).

That means thousands of Greggs workers will share £17.6 million in bonuses this month, PA Media reports.     8.33am GMT   Another freeze in fuel duty would be welcomed by the UK’s petrol retailers. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), said yesterday:  “The Spring Budget presents a pivotal moment for addressing the pressing concerns facing petrol retailers across the UK. Fuel duty has long been a key concern, providing relief to motorists amidst escalating living costs. Temporary cuts and freezes have been welcome, offering relief amidst economic uncertainty. However, the prospect of reversing these measures poses a threat, potentially aggravating the financial strain on consumers already grappling with volatile global energy prices.  Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis is also cheered by today’s report that the chancellor will not lift duty tomorrow:  A big win for motorists with the Chancellor keeping the 5p cut in fuel duty & continuing the inflation freeze.Delighted to have campaigned with my friend @HowardCCox & @TheSun to deliver this, with drivers £16.50 better off every time they fill up.https://t.co/Rvy1u8tkBM— Jonathan Gullis MP (@GullisJonathan) March 5, 2024  But as this chart shows, the 14-year freeze in fuel duty has cost the Treasury billions of pounds in lost tax, and also lowered the pressure on fossil fuel-powered motorists to drive less, or shift to electric cars.

Greggs grew its like-f0r-like sales by 13.7% in 2023, its latest financial results show. Total sales were up almost 20%, with Greggs’ expansion plans leading to a net increase of 145 stores (taking its total estate to 2,473 shops by the end of December) Pre-tax profits jumped by 27% to £188.3m – swelled by a £20.6m insurance payout due to business interruption in 2020 during the pandemic. Greggs benefitted from the slowdown in price rises for raw materials and energy last year  Greggs also reports that it has started 2024 “well”, with like-for-like sales up 8.2% ao far this year, and is confident of another year of good progress. Roisin Currie, Greggs chief executive, says:   Our strong growth during these tough years for the British economy gives me great optimism for the years ahead.

Despite being restricted in his scope for pre-election giveaways by the weakness of the public finances, the chancellor is expected to announce a five-year package of funding worth £100m. The Treasury said the money would allow the Turing – set up in 2015 and named after the pioneering computer scientist and mathematician who died in 1954 – to make fresh advances in data science and AI. The extra funding will be allocated to research in three areas where AI is seen as having an important role to play: transforming healthcare, protecting the environment, and strengthening defence and national security. Treasury sources said the money would have a direct impact on the public through better healthcare and tackling biodiversity challenges.

There are multiple reports this morning that the chancellor will extend the current 5p cut in fuel duty for another year. Hunt is also expected to scrap an inflation-linked rise in duel duty – extending a freeze that began in 2011. Another freeze would help motorists through the cost of living squeeze, at a time when motor fuel is rising at the fastest rate in five months. The Daily Mail says it’s a bid to show “the government is on the side of ordinary motorists”. The Times reports:  Although not raising fuel duty in line with inflation and keeping the 5p cut will cost the Treasury £5 billion in the next fiscal year, it does not affect Hunt’s room for other tax cuts because they are deemed to be temporary — even though fuel duty has been frozen since 2011.   Jeremy Hunt is preparing to freeze fuel duty for another year in a move that will be welcomed by motorists but cost the Treasury about £5bn ⬇️ https://t.co/suRcvDwUla— The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) March 5, 2024  New data from the RAC this morning shows that average price of petrol rose by 4p a litre in February while diesel shot up by nearly 5p. Yesterday, the chancellor insisted that he wants to move the UK to become a “lower taxed economy” but will only do so in a “responsible” way. That implies tax cuts funded by lower spending, rather than higher borrowing. But new data today shows NHS funding faces the biggest cuts in real terms since the 1970s, an influential analysis shows, adding to the pressure on Hunt to prioritise public service funding over tax cuts.   Related: NHS funding faces biggest real-terms cuts since 1970s, warns IFS   A year ago, the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out that the chancellor could fund a bigger pay rise for public sector workers by cancelling plans for a fuel duty freeze….     7.20am GMT   The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has also repeated its plea for “fairer” taxation of electric vehicles (EVs), urging chancellor Jeremy Hunt to halve VAT on the purchase of new EVs. They also want public charging to be “as easy and affordable as plugging in at home”. Currently, public EV chargers attract a full VAT rate of 20%; but if electric car drivers charge up at home, they only pay 5%.     7.19am GMT  New car market 'records strongest February in 20 years'  The new car market recorded its strongest February in 20 years, figures due this morning are expected to show. The latest car registration figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) are expected to show that new car sales rose more than 10% last month compared with February 2023. The SMMT also reports that battery-powered electric vehicles had a market share of around 17% last month. We’ll get the full sales data at 9am…     7.19am GMT  Introduction: UK retailers suffer washout February  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. The health of the UK economy is in focus this week, as Jeremy Hunt puts the finishing touches to tomorrow’s budget. And UK retailers are warning this morning that they suffered a grim February, as bad weather drove shoppers from the high street. UK retail sales increased by just 1.1% year on year in February, much slower than the 5.2% annual growth posted a year ago in February 2023, the British Retail Consortium reports this morning.  That suggests a significant drop in sales volumes, as inflation was 4% in January. While food sales rose 6%, non-food sales decreased by 2.5% year-on-year as consumers continued to cut back on footwear, household appliances, furniture and clothing. But there was a pick-up in demand for toys to entertain fractious children unable to go out and play last month. Helen Dickinson OBE, chief executive of the BRC, said:  “Consumer demand was dampened by the wettest February on record, translating into a poor month of retail sales growth. Not even Valentine’s Day lifted customers out of the gloom, and gifting products that typically sell well, like jewellery and watches, failed to deliver. On the sunnier side, rainy weather did brighten sales of toys, as parents looked for ways to occupy their children indoors.    Related: UK retail sales dampened as shoppers stay home in wet weather   The BRC’s sales data paints “a gloomy picture”, says Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis.  “Retailers can’t do much when the weather is so bad, apart from slash prices or try to encourage greater online ordering. “Sadly, the backdrop remains difficult for a lot of consumers as interest rates are persistently high and household finances remain under pressure. Therefore, time away from the shops is more likely to result in less spending rather than shifting the emphasis to the online sales channel.  Also coming up today China has set itself the ambitious target of growing its economy by 5% this year, as it battles the slowdown in its property sector, weak investor confidence and geopolitical worries. The target was presented at the opening session of the National People’s Congress, where China’s premier, Li Qiang, spoke of the “challenges” facing China’s leaders. He cited the global economy and regional tensions as hurdles for China’s recovery, as well as domestic issues such as low consumer demand in a challenging labour market.   Related: China sets challenging GDP target in face of regional tensions and ageing population   And bitcoin is getting closer to its alltime high of $69,000, as the rally in crypto assets continues. Overnight, the world’s largest crypto asset jumped as high as $68,828, meaning it’s gained 60% this year – and 161% over the last six months. The launch of various exchange-traded funds which track bitcoin have helped push its value higher this year, analysts say. Gold is also in demand, with the spot price of bullion near a record high this morning at $2,117 per ounce. Kyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com, adds:  “There are signs of slight irrational exuberance and maybe a squeeze of long-suffering shorts in some markets,” particularly bitcoin and gold.”  The agenda  9am GMT: UK car sales for February 9am GMT: Eurozone services PMI for February 9.30am GMT: UK services PMI for February 10am GMT: Eurozone PPI index of producer price inflation 3pm GMT: US services PMI for February   "

        "content": "Thousands of Greggs workers will share a £17.6m bonus pot this month after the bakery chain famous for its sausage rolls and steak bakes said it had made a record annual profit and overtaken McDonald’s to become the UK’s most popular breakfast spot. Britain’s biggest bakery chain said 25,000 employees – out of a total of 32,000 across the UK – would receive a bonus in their pay packets at the end of March, as it reported a 27% jump in profits to £188m. Under a profit share agreement, Greggs shares 10% of profits each year with staff who have worked at the chain for at least six months. The payment to each employee varies: for example, someone working 22 hours a week with six years’ service will receive £765. Greggs said there was better news for its customers, too, with no further price rises planned this year. It increased prices by between 5p and 10p on some items in December but held down the cost of bestselling items including its sausage rolls and vegan sausage rolls. Roisin Currie, the Greggs chief executive, said: “We have no plans for further price rises. We’re still talking about the cost of living crisis. We know that the consumer disposable income remains under pressure. “It’ll be another tough year. Last year and the year before were tough for the consumer, and that may continue through this year. What’s helpful is that we are seeing a lower level of inflation in the economy.” Greggs expects cost inflation of between 4% and 5% this year, led by wage rises, although this partly depends on geopolitical risks but Murphy said the company expected that to be offset by the December price rise and efficiency savings. Cost inflation averaged 8.5% last year but ended 2023 closer to 5%, as pay was fixed from January, food and packaging price rises slowed during the second half and energy costs were less volatile. Currie said Greggs had overtaken McDonald’s to become the UK’s No 1 takeaway breakfast seller for the first time, with 19.6% of visits, after adding items such as bacon rolls to its menu and gradually shifting opening hours to between 5am and 6.30am from 8am or later 10 years ago. “We have been evolving into that market,” she said, adding that Greggs was not expecting to overtake McDonald’s for later meals, as its share of takeaway dinners is still less than 2%, for example. The company said its full day market share was a record high, with its share of food-to-go visits 8.2%, up from 7.7% in 2022.  The company raised its dividend payout to shareholders, after posting 8.2% growth in like-for-like sales – at stores open at least a year – in the first nine weeks of 2024. Pre-tax profit rose 27% to £188m in 2023. Sales in company-managed shops climbed 13.7% year on year. The chain introduced a new range of flatbread sandwiches and new savoury bakes, including the spicy vegetable curry bake. It said evening meals such as chicken goujons, potato wedges and pizzas were selling well, and it brought back the vegan steak bake after customers asked for it. The rise in the national minimum wage to £11.44 an hour for adults aged 21 and over from 1 April should help to “put some more money into the pockets of the consumer”, Currie said. The evening is the fastest-growing part of the day, and Greggs is looking to hire more staff to serve customers on their way home from work. Delivery sales grew 23.6% last year after partnerships with Just Eat and Uber Eats. Greggs runs 2,473 shops after 145 net openings last year, including at Canary Wharf and Waterloo stations in London and at Gatwick airport. It intends to open up to 160 net new shops this year, as it is aiming for more than 3,000 UK stores over the longer term. Some of those will be via partnerships with retailers including Primark, Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Greggs shares were up 5% on Tuesday morning, making it one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 250."

        "published_date": "2024-03-05T13:46:31+00:00",
        "content": "New car sales in the UK surged to the highest February figure in 20 years, boosted by companies buying electric vehicles for their fleets, even as private uptake of EVs declined. Registrations of new cars climbed 14% year-on-year to 84,886 vehicles last month, the best February performance since 2004, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the 19th consecutive month of growth, mainly driven by company fleets investing in the latest vehicles. February is traditionally volatile, as the lowest-volume month of the year, with buyers often choosing to wait until March and the new number plate. Electrified vehicles recorded robust growth, with sales of hybrid electric vehicles rising 12.1% but taking a slightly smaller market share of 12.7%. Plug-in hybrids posted the largest growth for the month, rising 29.1% to reach 7.2% of the market. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) also outpaced the rest of the market, rising 21.8% to account for 17.7% of registrations. The SMMT said the long-term picture would become clearer in March, the busiest month for car sales. The increase in EV uptake is entirely driven by fleets, owing to fiscal incentives, while private buyers have accounted for less than a fifth (18.2%) of new BEVs sold so far this year. Many consumers worry about the cost of electric vehicles, the longevity of their batteries and the availability of charging points. A House of Lords committee last month called on ministers to intervene to boost the secondhand EV market and allay “uncertainty and concerns” over the health of the vehicles’ batteries. Peers on the environment and climate change committee urged the government to step up efforts to encourage EV adoption. The SMMT said a faster transition depended on more private buyers switching but that the lack of significant incentives was holding many back. It added that Wednesday’s budget was an opportunity for the chancellor to stimulate demand by halving VAT on new EVs for three years, amending proposed vehicle excise duty changes, and reducing VAT on public charging in line with home charging. While consumers do not pay VAT on other emission-reduction technologies such as heat pumps and solar panels, private EV buyers pay the full 20% levied on all cars, whether they are electric, petrol or diesel. Halving VAT on new EV purchases would save the average buyer about £4,000 on the upfront purchase price but cost the Treasury less than the plug-in car grant that was scrapped in 2022, the SMMT argued.   Related: Make used electric cars cheaper and tackle battery fears, peers tell ministers   Moreover, upcoming changes to vehicle excise duty next year would lead to the majority of buyers of battery-powered electric vehicles being effectively penalised by £1,950 for going electric because of the “expensive car” supplement. Those unable to charge a BEV at home pay a “pavement penalty” of 20% VAT on public charging – quadruple the rate paid by those with the opportunity to charge at home. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: “The new car market’s ability to deliver growth continues with its best February for 20 years and this week’s budget is an opportunity to ensure that growth is greener. “Tackling the triple tax barrier as the market embarks on its busiest month of the year would boost EV demand, cutting carbon emissions and energising the economy. It will deliver a faster and fairer zero-emission transition, putting Britain’s EV ambition back in the fast lane.”"

        "content": "Reach, the publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers, has cut the amount set aside to deal with legal claims relating to phone hacking and unlawful information-gathering by £20m as it seeks to draw a line under the scandal. The company, which owns scores of newspapers and websites across the UK including the Express, the Daily Record, the Manchester Evening News and the Liverpool Echo, said it had set aside £18.2m to deal with such claims, which it said was its best estimate of the amount needed to settle the long-running legal controversy. Announcing its annual results on Tuesday, Reach said it would release a further £20.2m provision after a high court ruling last year set clear parameters on the time limits for new cases.   Related: From bot reporters to the loss of a legendary editor, the Daily Mirror is hanging by a thread | Jane Martinson   Last December Mirror Group Newspapers, owned by Reach, was ordered to pay Prince Harry £140,000 after the high court found he had been the victim of unlawful information-gathering by Mirror Group Newspapers. The ruling also meant that all cases issued after 31 October 2020 are likely to be dismissed unless exceptional circumstances apply. Reach expects to resolve the majority of outstanding claims this year and in 2025 – effectively drawing a line under the controversy, which has cost the group about £110m in total. Jim Mullen, the chief executive, said: “I’ve been writing a lot of cheques for a lot of money and this will effectively put this issue to bed.” Mullen added that Reach had resolved a longstanding problem involving its pension funds. Its agreement with trustees gives clarity on the scale of its future pension commitments – which from 2028 will reduce substantially from its current rate of £60m. Reach shares were up 14% on Tuesday. The company reported adjusted operating profit of £96.5m in the 53 weeks to 31 December – slightly better than the £95m expected by analysts. Profit before tax on a statutory basis fell 45% in 2023 to £36.7m from £66.2m in 2022 as Reach suffered a drop in advertising and a sharp drop in traffic to its webpages after Facebook, one of its largest traffic referrers, made changes to its feed that deprioritised news content. Reach was also affected by updates to Google’s core algorithm that forced it to change how it delivered content to readers. Reach said its headcount had fallen by 14% last year. In November it announced it was cutting 450 jobs in one of the biggest annual culls in the UK newspaper industry for decades. In January this year Reach confirmed the departure by mutual agreement of the Daily Mirror’s Alison Phillips, a longstanding employee who was the title’s first female editor since its launch in 1903."

        "content": "Shares in the UK telecoms firm Spirent Communications jumped 60% after it accepted a £1bn offer from a US rival in the latest takeover of a British company by a foreign firm. The Arizona-based Viavi Solutions, which manufactures, tests and monitors equipment for networks, will pay 172.5p in cash and a special dividend of 2.5p, in lieu of a final dividend, for each Spirent share. Spirent shares rose as high as 174.90p, up 60%, making it the top riser on the FTSE 250.   Related: UK economy ‘turns a corner’ as growth picks up; Jeremy Hunt ‘to cut national insurance and freeze fuel duty’ – business live   There has been a flurry of takeover offers for UK companies from foreign suitors looking to take advantage of low valuations. UK assets are considered to be cheap, weighed down by a weaker pound, the struggling UK economy and the lingering impact of Brexit. Last week, bosses at the haulage company Wincanton threw their support behind a £762m takeover offer from the US logistics business GXO and dropped their backing for a rival bid from France’s CEVA. CEVA said on Tuesday that it would not raise its offer. The insurer Direct Line rejected a £3.1bn offer from its Belgian rival Ageas that it described as “highly opportunistic”. The electrical goods chain Currys rejected an improved takeover offer worth £742m from the US investment group Elliott Advisors. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showed the value of deals where a foreign company bought a UK company rose to £8.6bn in the fourth quarter, from £5.3bn in the previous quarter. News of the Spirent takeover came as the Crawley-headquartered company, which employs 1,500 people, reported an 80% plunge in 2023 pre-tax profits to $22.9m (£18.1m). Revenues fell 22% to $474m. The Spirent chief executive, Eric Updyke, said high interest rates and inflationary pressures affected customers in the telecommunications sector, which cut costs and cut back on capital spending. The deal is expected to drive the combined group’s product development in artificial intelligence and machine learning, security, cloud-native architecture and automation. As part of the deal, the private equity group Silver Lake will invest $400m in Viavi. The Nasdaq-listed Viavi has a market value of $2.2bn and employs 3,600 people, including 400 in the UK. Its customers include Cisco Systems, Nokia, British Telecom Openreach, Deutsche Telekom and Verizon Communications. Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the trading platform interactive investor, said Spirent was “a further example of UK companies as bid targets given the currently undemanding level of valuations, which has led to a number of acquisition approaches over recent weeks”. “Another tech firm bites the dust,” said Neil Wilson, the chief markets analyst at Finalto. “The move just adds to the sense that the shallow waters of the London market are not enough for tech firms to thrive. There is a lot for the chancellor to consider ahead of tomorrow’s budget if he is serious about support for the London market and the City in general. Scrapping the 0.5% stamp duty reserve tax would be a start; but a pro-growth, pro-investment regime change is really what’s required.”"

        "published_date": "2024-03-05T06:00:00+00:00",
        "content": "There is a Soho House meme account on Instagram with 128,000 followers. Among its recent posts are ones lampooning the exclusive private members’ club for supposed frat boy behaviour and a video with the caption: “Love it when £200 leaves my bank account then I’m told to wait four hours for a table at 3pm.” It has hit a nerve with some members and investors worldwide. “It’s like this every time, every time I come,” says Zach, an “every house” member, which means he can access all of the 42 houses across the world for £2,920 a year. “You can never get a table, it takes ages to get served, and you’re paying a lot for the privilege of being a member. I don’t really know what the point is any more. It doesn’t feel special, I don’t feel special.” Soho House’s rapid expansion, in terms of the number of locations and number of members – about 200,000 people – has got longstanding customers griping. So much so that it has attracted the attention of the Wall Street short sellers GlassHouse, which recently warned that Soho House was “facing an existential crisis” that was “eerily similar to WeWork”, the once red-hot shared office provider that collapsed into bankruptcy. Soho House rejects any comparison with WeWork, saying that at the end of its third quarter the company reported $30m (£24m) of cashflow from operating activities and had approximately $250m of liquidity. The pressure will mount on Soho House’s bosses – including the founder, Nick Jones – when the company reports its full-year results on 6 March. The business, which Jones founded with a single “house” on Soho’s Greek Street 29 years ago, has never turned a profit – and pre-tax losses this year are expected to come in at about $73m. The GlassHouse salvo, which accused Soho House of running “a broken business model” and “terrible accounting”, sent shares in the company down 19% on the day of the report in February. The shares have recovered to $5.97, to value the business at about $1.2bn, but are still down from the $14 its shares were floated at on the New York stock exchange in July 2021. Soho House has said it “fundamentally rejects” the GlassHouse report, which it says “contains factual inaccuracies, analytical errors, and false and misleading statements, all designed to adversely impact the company’s stock price for the benefit of the short-seller”. The chain, which appointed Andrew Carnie to replace Jones as chief executive in 2022, says it is “confident in the strength of its business and is focused on executing its strategy”. The company, which is in a close period ahead of its results, says its majority owners have been taking advantage of the fall in the share price to increase their stakes, and that a board special committee was evaluating “certain strategic transactions, some of which may result in the company becoming a private company”. The US retail billionaire Ron Burkle’s investment vehicle Yucaipa is Soho House’s biggest shareholder, and together Burkle, the restaurateur Richard Caring and Jones own more than 70% of the shares. When Soho House started above Jones’s restaurant Cafe Boheme in 1995 only people working in the creative industries were allowed in – bankers and those dressed in suits and ties, while not banned from applying, often found their memberships cancelled. Jones, who is married to the TV and radio presenter Kirsty Young, later relaxed the rules to allow anyone “with a creative soul”, no matter what job they did, to join the clubs. “What we like are decent nice kind people, anyone with a creative soul,” Jones said in an interview before he stood down as chief executive in 2022 after revealing a prostate cancer diagnosis. “It means you can work in any industry that you choose. I think that’s an evolution … When we [started] we thought if you’ve got a creative soul the only thing you would be doing would be a creative job. But I’ve met lots of people who are incredibly creative souls who might not be in a creative job.” The anti-financier vibe came back to bite in 2015, when Jones tried to raise money from bankers by inviting them to a bond presentation at its Shoreditch House venue near the City of London. “It’s pretty funny,” one potential investor told Reuters at the time. “They say that we’re not cool enough to join their club but they’re perfectly willing to take our money when they need it.” Another said Soho House’s message was simply: “We don’t want you; we want your money!” While Soho House has never made a profit, it has succeeded in becoming the go-to party spot for the rich and famous, from Kate Moss, Kendall Jenner and Ellie Goulding to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Sussexes met on a blind date in 2016 at its 76 Dean Street house, one of eight Soho Houses now in London including a townhouse in Mayfair, and a club, hotel and rooftop pool inside the BBC’s former studios in White City. Across the world there are 42 houses – from Istanbul to Mexico City – three Ned hotels, a beach club in Mykonos, Greece, and nine shared workspaces. More are planned: Soho Houses in Portland, Oregon; São Paulo, inside a historic former maternity hospital; Miami; Charleston; and Manchester will open this year. In the longer term, houses are planned in Rhinebeck in upstate New York and Sydney, Australia. The Manchester house will occupy five floors of the former Granada Studios, with promise of several bars and restaurants, a gym and the trademark rooftop area. “It’s great that Soho House is going to cities like Manchester,” says Amanda, who works in advertising and has been a member for 15 years. “But when there are so many houses around the world, and so many people are members, it kind of takes away the exclusivity – and to be honest it is the exclusivity that we are all paying for.”"

        "content": "Mortgage reforms introduced after the 2008 banking crisis have “tilted too far” in support of financial stability to the point that first-time buyers are being excluded from the housing market, building societies have warned. A report commissioned by the Building Societies Association has called for an overhaul of affordability and repayment rules, which they say have contributed to a steady decline in first-time buyer mortgages since the mid-2000s. The BSA, whose 42 members serve 26 million customers across the UK and hold more than £500bn in assets, says it should involve reviewing the 15% cap on the amount of home loans a lender can offer that are worth 4.5 times the borrower’s income.   Related: UK house prices rise for first time in more than a year as mortgage costs drop   It is also pushing for the introduction of more flexible mortgage products that allow for part repayment, part interest-only lending that could change over the term of the loan. The latter proposal echoes policies that pre-date the 2007-08 financial crisis, when it was common for households to have interest-only mortgages that could nearly halve their monthly repayments. Those mortgages allowed borrowers to take out large loans that they never had the prospect of repaying, but faced a major crackdown by regulators in the wake of the banking crash. The BSA says those regulations should now be reviewed. “An important balance, that has been a key feature of the mortgage market since the financial crisis, is the compromise between financial stability and first-time buyer numbers,” it said. “The last decade has seen the balance tilted in favour of financial stability and that has had an inevitable cost, with many excluded from home ownership – particularly those with single incomes, lower than average incomes, or unstable incomes and with less wealth.” The association said it was aware that looser rules had previously led lenders to take greater risks, including in the 1980s and early 2000s, which had “ended poorly”. “There is no correct answer for the appropriate balance, but it needs honest debate about the costs and benefits,” the BSA said. Chris Sykes, the technical director of the mortgage broker Private Finance, cautioned that more flexible products could complicate affordability tests for lenders, but were not out of the realm of possibility. “Flexibility in mortgages is important for first-time buyers,” he said. “I would be in support for some low-start mortgage options to come back, where either a rate is more back-end loaded on a product, or a product allows for an initial period with a higher percentage on interest-only that bands down over time. How a lender would demonstrate affordability on such a product would be difficult, and would be where the regulators could work with them to help.”"

        "content": "Soggy February weather and continued cost of living pressures put a dampener on retail sales last month, with growth slowing to just over 1% as many households saved cash by snuggling up on the sofa. Sales of non-food items slumped by 2.5% in the three months to February – led by declining demand for footwear, household appliances, furniture and clothing – amid weak consumer confidence, according to the latest retail sales monitor from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the advisory firm KPMG. Food sales increased 6% but that was slower than the 6.3% reported last month as inflation eased. Shoppers put more groceries in their baskets, but still kept a tight rein on spending as they continued to battle with high costs elsewhere including energy bills and the cost of borrowing.   Related: ‘It’s all fallen flat’: households earning more than £60,000 on how they are struggling financially   The combined food and non-food figures meant total retail sales rose 1.1% in February, a slowdown from 1.2% in January and 1.7% in December. Health and beauty, toys and home accessories such as cushions and cooking utensils were the few retail bright spots as families sought to find entertainment at home. Even above-average earners are tightening their belts in the face of high interest rates, which have started to affect more mortgages, car finance and other borrowing. Households also turned to takeaways, fast food and streaming services as the south of England endured its wettest February on record, according to separate data from Barclays. Digital content and subscriptions experienced the highest growth (11.8%) in spending since August 2021, according to its consumer spend report, partly spurred by popular new series including Netflix’s One Day as well as the weather. In contrast, spending in restaurants contracted 13.4%, a faster pace than January, while growth in spending at bars, pubs and clubs was at its lowest level (1.1%) since September 2022. Karen Johnson, the head of retail at Barclays, said: “February’s wet weather meant Britons chose to spend more time indoors, resulting in a slowdown in high street and hospitality spending. This shift in behaviour meant ‘insperiences’ enjoyed a boost, as consumers opted to enjoy cosy nights in with a TV show and a takeaway.” The slowdown has hit hospitality businesses as they struggle with high energy bills, increased staff wages and continued food price inflation, leading to a net 3,000 licensed premises closing last year according to research from CGA and AlixPartners. Leading hospitality groups, such as nightclubs, restaurants, hotels and pubs, achieved sales growth of just 0.1% last month amid rising costs. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, which represents most big retailers, said the near-record rain of February had translated into a particularly poor month of sales growth: “Not even Valentine’s Day lifted customers out of the gloom, and gifting products that typically sell well, like jewellery and watches, failed to deliver.” The poor retail figures add to pressure on already struggling fashion brands such as Superdry, Asos and Boohoo as well as household good specialists such as Currys and John Lewis. Online clothing specialists are being hit particularly hard, with the figures showing that shoppers continued to direct more of their non-essential spending to physical stores despite the bad weather. The proportion of non-food bought online dipped to 35.7% in February from 36.1% a year before as shoppers tried to save on delivery and returns charges. Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer markets at the advisory firm KPMG, said cuts in national insurance rates introduced in January, which were intended to increase individuals’ spending power, had so far failed to feed through to the high street. “As many households continue to adapt budgets to meet higher essential costs, including higher mortgage rates, consumer reluctance to get out there and start spending is likely to remain in the short term,” she said. She added that retailers would be “pinning their hopes on some good news in the chancellor’s spring budget this week to help kickstart a spending revival on the high street” as they continued to be squeezed by lower demand and faced increases in labour costs and business rates in April."

        "content": "Another bum note from Hipgnosis Songs Fund. The investment trust managed to put the decimal point in the wrong place in its much-anticipated announcement of what a new valuer thinks its catalogue of songs from acts such as Blondie, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Shakira might really be worth. It meant 92p a share, but said 0.92 pence a share. A correction followed. The correction that long-term shareholders must dearly wish for is that Hipgnosis had never come to the stock market in the first place in 2018. Against a starting price of 100p, the revised net asset value looks poor, as opposed to shocking, but is only half the story. First, the new asset figure is a cut of 26% from the last estimate six months ago from the previous valuer. Different methodologies produce different outcomes, but $2.6bn-ish to $1.9bn-ish is a big drop. Second, Hipgnosis added that the valuation doesn’t include tax charges that could apply if the assets were sold at the new level. Third, the board said the lower figure means no dividends “for the foreseeable future”, a humiliating position for a fund established to turn royalty payments from a broad portfolio of songs into a reliable income stream for investors.   Related: Hipgnosis cuts value of music portfolio that includes Beyoncé and Blondie hits   Add all those factors to the mix – plus a fall-out with the fund’s investment adviser, a firm led by the Hipgnosis pioneer Merck Mercuriadis and majority-owned by Blackstone – and one can understand why the market price of the shares fell to 58p, down 8% on the day. The question now is how the board, much-changed from the crew that oversaw the acquisition of the songs, intends to improve matters. Come back at the end of the month to discover chairman Robert Naylor’s answer, but the holding position of stopping dividends to pay down debt looks a non-starter as a permanent strategy. Last autumn’s vote against continuing the trust in its current form was, in effect, a vote for more radical measures. That leaves a sale of the catalogue of songs in part or whole. One little irony here, though, is that shareholders last year also voted against the sale of 65,000 songs for $440m, partly because the discount to book value was so steep. Compared with the new lower valuation, the discount no longer looks out of whack – albeit that transaction only covered a fifth of the portfolio. Do interested parties for a bigger transaction exist? Well, Blackstone, the would-be buyer in the rejected $440m deal, might want another run, but the perceived conflict of interest with its role as owner of Hipgnosis investment adviser, was the other stumbling block last time. Appetite among other private equity and investment houses is hard to gauge in an illiquid market (one reason, on top of the related valuation complications, why this type of “alternative” asset class looks ill-suited to the public markets). But some form of break-up, with the aim of getting the balance sheet into a position to resume dividends, looks the most promising route to try to limit the damage. As the sunken share price suggests, an income fund that doesn’t pay dividends makes no sense."

        "content": "Apple has been fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) by the EU after an investigation found it had limited competition from music streaming services such as Spotify. The fine is nearly four times higher than expected as the European Commission attempts to show it will act decisively on tech companies who abuse their dominant position in the market for online services. The European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said a smaller fine would have been nothing more than the equivalent of a parking fine and the €1.8bn was designed to act as a deterrent against a repetition of such practices by Apple or others. “I think it is important to see that if you are a company who is dominant and you do something illegal, it will be punished. We want to show our resolve that we will go into these cases.” As a result of the anti-competitive practices, the public ended up paying more than they should have for music streaming, she said. “Apple’s rules ended up harming consumers. Critical information was withheld so that consumers could not effectively use or make informed choices. Some consumers may have paid more because they weren’t aware that they can pay less if they subscribed outside of the app,” Vestager said. The case followed complaints made by Spotify and centred on Apple’s App Store as the sole gateway for iphone apps. “Apple’s conduct, which lasted for almost 10 years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions,” the European Commission said in a statement. Vestager said consumers may have paid two or three euros a month more for music streaming because of the lack of open competition. However, she conceded that the fine would not be distributed to customers who had been allegedly exploited but to individual member states. She said the fine represented 0.5% of Apple’s global turnover.  The tech company disadvantaged users by restricting app developers from openly promoting cheaper music subscription services available outside the Apple “ecosystem” , the commission found. “Music streaming developers were not allowed to inform the users inside their own apps of cheaper prices for the same subscription on the internet,” in an “anti-steering” practice, she said. “They were also not allowed to change links in their apps to the consumers to their websites and pay lower prices there,” she told a press conference in Brussels. Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with new rules that will force them to allow fair competition from rivals. The deadline on Thursday to comply is expected to result in immediate changes on the IoS and Android app stores.  Spotify, the world’s biggest music streaming service, has argued that the restrictions benefit Apple’s rival music streaming service, Apple Music. Spotify and other app providers have been longstanding critics of Apple’s App Store, which they argue stifles competition by charging a 30% fee on apps and in-app purchases. However, Apple has announced plans to allow EU customers to download apps on to iPhones outside the App Store, in response to the introduction of the trading bloc’s DMA, which has been brought in to regulate major tech firms such as Apple, Microsoft and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. Responding to the fine, Apple said: “The decision was reached despite the commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast. “The primary advocate for this decision – and the biggest beneficiary – is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation. “Today, Spotify has a 56% share of Europe’s music streaming market – more than double their closest competitor’s – and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world. A large part of their success is due to the App Store, along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.” Apple added that it intended to appeal. Spotify said: “This decision sends a powerful message – no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers. “It is a basic concept of free markets – customers should know what options they have, and customers, not Apple, should decide what to buy, and where, when and how.” Max von Thun, the Europe director of the Open Markets Institute, which researches the impact of corporate monopolies, said the large fine “sets a positive precedent which the EU would do well to draw on in future enforcement actions against tech giants”. .  The tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with a full list of dos and don’ts under the new laws, after which they could be fined up to 10% of their turnover."

        "content": "  3.14pm GMT  Closing summary  Time to recap… Apple has been fined €1.84bn by European authorities for stifling competition from rival music streaming services. Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition chief, said the tech giant had broken EU antitrust rules for a decade by “restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem”. It is the first time the iPhone maker has been punished for breaching EU law. Apple has vowed to appeal, insisting it has created Europe’s thriving digital music market. Vestager also revealed that most of the penalty – €1.8bn – was a punitive penalty added to make sure the level of the fine matched Apple’s financial strength, on top of a ‘traditional’ penalty of around €40m calculated under EU rules. Spotify welcomed the decision, saying it sends a powerful message that no company can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers.

The energy profit levy (EPL) was introduced in May 2022 after the jump in energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which led to soaring profits for energy firms. The levy, currently 35%, means the overall tax burden on North Sea oil and gas producers is 75%. It is due to expire in 2028. But, Reuters reports that Hunt is expected to extend the levy by one more year to 2029 in Wednesday’s budget. The tax rate, as well as a 29% investment allowance in the windfall tax that allows companies to offset spending, would remain unchanged, sources said.     2.01pm GMT   Here’s some early reaction to the EU-Apple news:  In response to the fine, @Apple basically accused the Commission of favoring Sweden-based @Spotify, and made a point to call out how many times (65) the Commission met with its streaming rival during its investigation.(Reminder, Spotify is listed in the U.S.) https://t.co/d4XJ9urIXD— Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) March 4, 2024   Here's some of Apple's response to EU Fine:“Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader.” [referring to Spotify] $AAPL $SPOT— Ed Ludlow (@EdLudlow) March 4, 2024   Higher than expected and “to ensure that the overall fine imposed on Apple is sufficiently deterrent.” Still, to put Apple’s fine of € 1,84 billion into perspective, here are quarterly revenues from services (which includes the App Store among others): https://t.co/kRXDh8RFTd pic.twitter.com/O7r35ITbuI— Reinhold Kesler (@reinholdkesler) March 4, 2024      1.03pm GMT  Apple shares lower in pre-market trading  Shares in Apple are weakening in pre-market trading, following the EU’s announcement. They’re down 1.5% at $176, from Friday night’s close of $179.66. But, news of a large fine in Europe isn’t the only factor. Apple has also just been dropped from Goldman Sachs’ list of highly recommended companies to invest in. Bloomberg explains:  Apple Inc. was removed from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s list of top buys after underperformance in its stock amid concerns over weak demand for its key products. The iPhone maker had ranked in the 20-25 member “Directors’ Cut” version of Goldman’s conviction list since it was unveiled last June. Its share price is little changed in that span while the S&P 500 Index has jumped almost 22%. Apple dropped 0.6% Friday after its removal from the list.

Spotify says the European Commission has made it clear that Apple’s behaviour limiting communications to consumers is unlawful.  It adds:  This decision sends a powerful message — no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers.  Spotify argues that the foundational belief, that the internet should be a fair and open ecosystem, should still apply on mobile phones, saying:  Apple’s rules muzzled Spotify and other music streaming services from sharing with our users directly in our app about various benefits—denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks. Of course, Apple Music, a competitor to these apps, is not barred from the same behaviour. By requiring Apple to stop its illegal conduct in the EU, the EC is putting consumers first. It is a basic concept of free markets—customers should know what options they have, and customers, not Apple, should decide what to buy, and where, when and how.       12.43pm GMT  Apple vows to appeal EU fine  Apple has claimed that the EU has failed for find any “credible evidence” that consumers have been harmed. In a hard-hitting response to today’s fine, Apple also insists it has played a key role in Spotify’s success, saying Europe’s digital music market is thriving. Apple also accuses the Swedish streaming company of working with the European Commission on “an investigation with little grounding in reality”. The US tech company says:  Today, the European Commission announced a decision claiming the App Store has been a barrier to competition in the digital music market. The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast. The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation. Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world. A large part of their success is due to the App Store, along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world. We’re proud to play a key role supporting Spotify’s success — as we have for developers of all sizes, from the App Store’s earliest days.  Apple adds that the facts simply don’t support this decision, adding “as a result, Apple will appeal”. Apple also accuses the EU of having tried to build “three different cases” against it. But each one, it claims, found no evidence of consumer harm or of anti-competitive behavior. Apple says:  Eight years of investigations have never yielded a viable theory explaining how Apple has thwarted competition in a market that is so clearly thriving.   Updated at 12.53pm GMT    12.36pm GMT   Q: You’ve explained that European consumers have been ripped off for a decade, for as long as Spotify has existed. Will there be any conpensation paid? Vesteger agrees that consumers have indeed paid too much, or not even been able to find what they were looking for, due to Apple’s anti-steering system. She suggests consumers could have paid two or three euros per month more, because of the restrictions on music streaming apps’ abilities to tell consumers about cheaper offers outside the App Store. However, it’s not within the framework of EU competition law to order compensation, she adds. Q: Where does the money go? The €1.84bn fine will go into the Commission’s budget, and eventually returned to member countries by lowering their budget contributions, Vesteger says (unless it is successfully appealed).  Updated at 12.52pm GMT    12.29pm GMT   The lump sum portion of Apple’s fine is worth €1.8bn, Margrethe Vestager, underlining her point that without it, the penalty would have been very small.  The Apple fine would have been quite small, @vestager says, noting it would have been a mere parking ticket for a company that size. So she ramped it up with a \"lump sum\" to make sure it was proportionate to a company that size. 1.84 billion is a chunky amount. /1— Lewis Crofts (@lewis_crofts) March 4, 2024      12.26pm GMT   Vestager says the EU will be watching closely that Apple complies with today’s ruling.     12.20pm GMT   Antitrust competition chief Margrethe Vestager is taking questions from reporters now. Q: €1.8bn is a large amount – clearly you tried to get it to a level where people at the top of Apple pay attention. And have you penalised them for supplying inaccurate information, as today’s ruling suggests has occured? Vestager says the fine has two elements, including a lump sum to ensure the penalty has enough weight. She explains that the standard penalty from the EU’s usual guidelines only came to a level comparable to “a parking ticket”. So she has also turned to EU rules which allow a lump sum to be added, to create a deterrant. It’s the first time this has occured in this sort of case, Vestager suggests, explaining that it has been used before in cartel cases. The total fine is just 0.5% of Apple’s annual worldwide turnover, she adds.  Updated at 12.21pm GMT    12.12pm GMT   Today’s €1.84bn fine reflects Apple’s financial power, and the harm its behaviour inflicted on millions of European users, Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels.     12.10pm GMT   As well as the fine, the EC is ordering Apple to stop preventing music-streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals away from its App Store.     12.09pm GMT  Vestager: Apple abused its dominant position  EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager is announcing Apple’s €1.8bn fine in Brussels now. She explains that Apple had imposed unfair trading conditions, by preventing music-streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals away from Apple’s App Store. Vestager says:  “For a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store. They did so by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem.”      12.04pm GMT  EU fines Apple €1.8bn over streaming restrictions  Newsflash: Apple has been fined €1.84bn by the EU following an investigation into restrictions imposed by its app store on music streaming providers such as Spotify. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, imposed the punishment after finding the iPhone maker had broken competition law by imposing curbs on app developers. The investigation, launched following a complaint from Spotify, focused on a restriction that prevented developers from telling iPhone and iPad users about cheaper music subscriptions that are available outside the App Store. Spotify has argued that the restrictions benefit Apple’s rival music streaming service, Apple Music. More to follow….

Previous generations tended to borrow over a 25-year term, but higher interest rates have been forcing borrowers to take out much longer loans. According to lobby group UK Finance, one in five first-time buyers took out a 35-year mortgage in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to less than one in ten a year earlier. That is the highest since at least 2008, its figures show.  It suggests that home ownership still remains out of reach for many, despite the longest-possible mortgage terms.  Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance, said:  “2023 was a tough year for UK households and we expect to see continued challenges in 2024. Affordability remains a barrier to home ownership, but pressures should start to ease gradually through this year and next. “Amidst ongoing cost challenges, it’s encouraging that customers don’t look to be running up higher levels of unsecured debt. But we know some households will be more affected than others - if you are struggling with personal loan, credit card or mortgage repayments, please reach out to your lender as soon as possible for help.”      11.29am GMT   Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has repeated this morning that he wants to cut taxes, but in a “responsible way”. Echoing comments he made yesterday, Hunt says the countries around the world which are growing fastest have lower taxes “because that makes a more dynamic, more energetic, more entrepreneural economy”. Speaking to broadcasters at Siemens’ UK factory today, following the announcement of £100m investment to secure 800 jobs, Hunt says:  We do want to move to a lower-taxed economy, but we’re only going to do so in a way that is responsible and recognises that there are things that taxes pay for, [and] that we couldn’t cut taxes by borrowing. We’ll do so in a responsible way.  If the goverment can run public services more efficiency, that will mean less pressure on taxpayers, he adds. Q: You’re reportedly planning to clamp down on non doms… why are you pinching Labour policies? Hunt says that we will have to see “precisely” what he announces on Wednesday, and adds that the government is “laying the foundations for long-term growth”.     11.15am GMT   Our Politics Live blog is tracking the latest developments ahead of Wednesday’s Budget, including research showing that the richest households will benefit 12 times more than the poorest if the chancellor cuts national insurance by 2p.

Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, says:  “Industry will welcome this announcement as yet another boost for key sectors that will put advanced manufacturing at the heart of the UK’s economic future. These industries will be key to addressing many of the societal challenges we face in a competitive world and highlight what can be achieved with a constructive dialogue between Government and business. Taken together they are another piece in the jigsaw of a modern industrial strategy to make the UK a world leader in key sectors of the future.”  Steve Smith, managing director at Alvarez & Marsal Tax, says :  “The reported inclusion of a £360m funding package in Wednesday’s budget would be a timely and much-needed boost for British businesses, particularly those in the aviation and EV industries. “These sectors are vital for maintaining long-term productivity, so funding is especially welcome considering that the skills agenda has been somewhat overshadowed in budget discussions up to now, often taking a backseat amidst the chatter about individual tax cuts.      9.56am GMT  KPMG fined £1.5m for ‘serious failings’ in M&C Saatchi audit  KPMG has been fined almost £1.5m by the UK’s accounting watchdog for “basic failings” in its audit of advertising company M&C Saatchi plc in 2018. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) fined KPMG after concluding it had not conducted the audit with sufficient professional scepticism when assessing “work in progress” credits which had lifted M&C Saatchi’s revenues. They also failed to properly audit journal entries, or show sufficient “professional scepticism” when assessing whether the ad agency was right to retain rebates which should have been passed back to clients. The FRC launched its investigation after M&C Saatchi’s discovered accounting errors in 2019, which led to its 2018 profits to be restated. It also released two profit warnings which hammered its share price. It had decided to fine KPMG £2,250,000, which has been reduced to £1.46m after it admitted its errors. Adrian Wilcox, KPMG’s audit engagement partner, has been fined £75,000, reduced to £48,750. Claudia Mortimore, the FRC’s deputy executive counsel, says:  “KPMG’s audit did not meet the required quality standards in a number of respects amounting to serious audit failings and breaches of audit standards. This included a lack of professional scepticism in certain high-risk areas of the audit and basic failings in journal testing.”   Updated at 12.22pm GMT    9.39am GMT   There are reports today that the chancellor could crack down on holiday lets to raise money to fund tax cuts on Wednesday. Jeremy Hunt could scrap the furnished holiday lets (FHL) regime, which gives tax reliefs on properties being rented out for holiday-goers.  The chancellor “hunts” down those holiday letting in the hope of flushing out the short term in favour of the long term by scrapping tax perks.

It comes two weeks after the Nikkei finally rose over the previous all-time high set in 1989, before stocks slumped through the 90s. The Nikkei has gained almost 20% so far this year, lifted by strong gains in technology firms amid the AI boom.

Grocery tech firm Ocado are down 4%, having said last week it is in a legal wrangle with Marks & Spencer over a final payment tied to their online joint venture. Rightmove, the property website, is down 3% after predicting last week that its customer numbers were ‘likely to drop slightly’ as economic uncertainty squeezes estate agents. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the FTSE 100 has opened in “lacklustre fashion”, adding:  Speculation over what’s in and what’s out of Jeremy Hunt’s budget is reaching fever pitch, ahead of the big reveal on Wednesday. What appears clear is that the Chancellor has a lot less fiscal room to play with than he hoped, which is why he’s played down speculation about significant tax cuts. Warnings are coming thick and fast, from the Office of Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund, about the financial irresponsibility of offering big sweeteners. Given the huge borrowing commitments the government already has to honour, it seems unlikely there will be a big fanfare of an income tax giveaway. However, a further cut to National Insurance is still on the cards. There is though likely to be a good deal of other tinkering by Houdini Hunt, who is set to show a sleight of hand with an array of smaller moves to try and please the voters ahead of the election.      8.34am GMT  Chancellor urged to cut VAT on electric car charging  Major carmakers and motoring groups have backed a letter by campaign group FairCharge and Auto Trader calling for the chancellor Jeremy Hunt to cut VAT on public charging for electric cars. Car manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall and Peugeot, signed the letter which said that 38% of electric vehicle drivers were unfairly disadvantaged by the VAT. Those that charge exclusively at home have to pay just 5% VAT on their energy bill compared to the 38% of drivers who do not have home charging, who have to pay 20%. The letter, which was also supported by the AA and the RAC, said that the difference between home and public charging costs was a barrier for many looking to buy an EV. Research by AutoTrader found that drivers charging off peak at home save £865 when compared to petrol vehicles, while those that use rapid public chargers could pay £264 more. Quentin Willson, FairCharge Founder and motoring journalist, said:  “If the Government is serious about wider EV adoption, they must revisit this out-of-date VAT legislation -- written in the early 1990s before the arrival of electric cars -- and make it fit for purpose.”      8.24am GMT   In a worrying sign for the UK’s financial sector, companies in Canary Wharf have cut their spending with London private taxi and courier company Addison Lee. Addison Lee’s CEO, Liam Griffin, has told the Financial Times that bookings at its courier business, which he described as a “true measure” of London’s economic activity, have fallen 10% year-on-year in the first two months of 2024. Griffin says:  “We would consider ourselves the barometer for economic activity in London. It was strong through calendar year 2023 but has definitely softened a little in 2024.”  More here.

But, experience suggests this strategy won’t work, he points out:  For a start, the sums involved will be relatively modest. The size of Hunt’s net giveaway on Wednesday is likely to be a maximum of £10bn, which is small beer in the context of a £2.5tn-a-year economy. The package will be smaller than last November’s autumn statement, which made no difference to the Conservative party’s dire opinion poll ratings.  Plus, the country is not in the same state as 1987, when Nigel Lawson cut taxes in a giveaway budget. More here.

The global technology company will use the money to replace its factory in Chippenham, with the new facility on the site expected to be completed by 2026. The current Chippenham plant is the country’s only factory dedicated to developing rail signalling and control systems, and manufactured the signalling tech being used on the Elizabeth line. It has also been a key site for the development of railway technology since the Victorian times. Its workload includes providing new digital signalling equipment to modernise the east coast main line from London to Edinburgh. When operational in 2026, the 800 manufacturing, research and engineering jobs at the present factory will be transferred to the new site without any impact on production. Joint CEO of Siemens Mobility UK & Ireland, Rob Morris, said:  “This investment is a strong commitment to Chippenham and our country. “Siemens Mobility’s Chippenham site, along with our 30 sites across the country, has been transforming rail, travel, and transport in Britain – and it will continue to do so with cloud-based rail technology connecting the real and the digital worlds, digitalizing rail.”   🚨 @SiemensMobility to invest £100m in a new, cutting-edge manufacturing & R&D facility in Chippenham, to build the next generation of digital railway signalling systems.This will:✅Support jobs✅Better connect communities✅Transform rail travel on the East Coast Main Line pic.twitter.com/VHVqEgKnoE— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 4, 2024   Read more here: https://t.co/WLUMeQKX9S— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 4, 2024  Jeremy Hunt has also welcomed Siemens’ decision, calling it “a big boost for Britain’s world-class manufacturing sector”.  Updated at 8.26am GMT    7.47am GMT  Introduction: Hunt announces £360m manufacturing funding package in growth push  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. As budget week begins, the British government has announced a new investment package to help make the UK “a world leader in manufacturing”. Worth a combined £360m from government and industry, the funding will support R&D and manufacturing projects in sectors where the UK is – or could be – world-leading, by unlocking investment from the private sector. It includes almost £200m for aerospace R&D projects, to develop energy-efficient and zero-carbon aircraft technology needed to achieve net zero aviation. There’s also £73m of joint funding for “cutting-edge automotive R&D projects” for electric vehicle technology, to make them more efficient and competitive. The Treasury explains:  Supported by more than £36m of government funding awarded through Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC) competitions, this includes four projects which are developing technologies for the next generation of battery electric vehicles, making them more efficient and competitive, led by companies including automotive manufacturers YASA and Empel Systems.  [This comes six months after prime minister Rishi Sunak’s green u-turn, when he delayed banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by five years to 2035]. The government is also contributing £7.5m to help two pharmaceutical companies to spend £84m to expand their UK plants; Almac, a pharmaceutical company in Northern Ireland produces drugs to treat diseases such as cancer, heart disease and depression, while Ortho Clinical diagnostics of Pencoed, Wales, produces medical testing products. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, says the money will help secure jobs and grow the economy:  “We’re sticking with our plan by backing the industries of the future with millions of pounds of investment to make the UK a world leader in manufacturing, securing the highly skilled jobs of the future and delivering the long-term change our country needs to deliver a brighter future for Britain”.  The economy certainly needs more investment; last summer, the IPPR think tank warned that the UK is bottom of G7 league table for business investment, leaving the country in a growth ‘doom loop’. Back in the autumn statement last November, the UK announced £4.5bn to increase investment in strategic manufacturing sectors – auto, aero, life sciences and clean energy.   Related: Autumn statement 2023: key points at a glance   But Labour’s shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, isn’t impressed by today’s announcement; he says the government is “incapable of providing the long-term stability manufacturing needs to thrive”. Reynolds added:  “Recycled announcements won’t be enough to turn around the lowest business investment in the G7.”  The funding announcement comes as Hunt puts the finishing touches to Wednesday’s budget, with Tory MPs pushing the chancellor to produce some voter-pleasing tax cuts. But is 1p, or more, off income tax really what people want, given the state of UK public services? An opinion poll of almost 5,000 people across Britain released by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) this morning shows that almost three-quarters were “very worried” or “fairly worried” about funding for the NHS and other public services, compared with less than half who were concerned about tax on earnings. JRF are warning Hunt that his budget risks condemning Britain to a second “lost decade” for living standards.

        "content": "An annual gross income of £74,000 puts Scott, 28, a software engineer from Leicestershire, in the top 10% of earners nationally. But, he says, it doesn’t feel that way for him and his family. “Ten years ago we’d have been laughing with my salary. Now, it feels like our heads are barely above water. There’s an attitude that at this level of income you’ve plenty of money, but it’s not true at all,” he says. The couple’s mortgage uses up more than a third of Scott’s take-home pay, the family’s monthly grocery shop costs more than £500, his student loan repayments are £300 – “money I now desperately need,” he says.   Related: UK middle classes ‘struggling despite incomes of up to £60,000 a year’   “We lease a car, the cost of which has risen greatly too because of higher interest rates. After all the things I have to pay for, we’re lucky to have £300 left over for the month, which is quickly depleted by day-to-day expenses. It feels like we’ve done everything we were told to do and yet we’re still struggling,” Scott says. “I worked hard at university to gain a valuable degree, I job-hopped to drastically increase my salary – but it’s not enough. I’ve considered reducing my pension contribution just so we can have more money. “My wife, who had stopped working to care for our two children, both under five, has been looking for work for a few months, but the kind of work she needs just doesn’t exist – remote flexitime. We’ve actually considered moving to a different country because this one feels set up against families and young people.” He believes taxation has become punitively high: “I pay almost £2,000 a month in taxes, which I can’t actually afford.” The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is under pressure from voters such as Scott and many in his own party to use Wednesday’s budget to announce personal tax cuts, most likely to either national insurance contributions or the basic rate of income tax. But the chancellor’s scope for such a move has been restricted in recent days by tighter than expected forecasts, as well as warnings that public services cannot survive further austerity to pay for pre-election giveaways. Scott has been left feeling pessimistic about the future: “I don’t see an end to any of this: life isn’t going to get cheaper and I’ve pretty much maxed out my earning potential. It’s ridiculous and I’m so sick of it. “We can’t afford holidays. We can’t afford to put money away for the kids. We can’t afford new things, gadgets, hobbies. What’s it all for?” Scott was just one of scores of middle-class earners who shared with the Guardian how they are struggling to cope financially and can no longer afford comfortable living standards despite having household incomes of between £60,000 and £120,000. A report last month from the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust highlighted how Britain’s insecure jobs market and high housing costs are leading to the growth of a precarious middle class. These households are struggling to maintain a decent living standard on joint incomes as high as £60,000 a year. That compares with the median gross annual earnings for full-time employees of £34,963 last April. Many readers who got in touch earn significantly more than this, but say they are still struggling to afford their bills and decent living standards due to rocketing mortgage, rental and childcare costs, higher household bills and the highest tax burden in 70 years. Parents and single people in particular argue their relatively high incomes are not sufficient to fund a reasonable lifestyle while taxes are so high. Among them is Chloe, 38, who owns her own home with an £180,000 mortgage outstanding and earns £57,500 a year in a senior role a charity in Sheffield. “Over the past six to eight months I’ve really found myself struggling to make ends meet while also not living a life completely devoid of any pleasure,” she says.  To save money, Chloe says, she has stopped drinking, eating takeaways and buying new clothes, as well as downgrading both her and her dog’s food. “I’ve also borrowed money from my parents, who were concerned by how little I was putting the heating on in my property and were worried it would cause damp.” Chloe, who is single, says she worries about not being able to afford having children, and a social life. Her current contract comes to an end in six months. “I’m very limited in what I can do socially and couldn’t afford to go even one month without working. It’s so frustrating when you hear the government say: ‘You can work your way out of poverty.’ “Work is not an answer when you’re taxing people at such a high level. I definitely think that the tax brackets should be reconsidered.” Matt, 32, who works in housing policy, says his and his partner’s combined household income is about £80,000 a year. “We live just outside Newcastle upon Tyne and aren’t struggling, but I know that’s because we are – and I hate the term – Dinks: double income, no kids, and living in a part of the country where costs are relatively lower. “It does seem that the only way to be on a middle income and doing OK at the moment is to be a Dink and living in the north.” Rose, 35, a thinktank project manager from south London and mother-of-one, strongly agrees. She earns £34,000 a year, her partner, who works in IT, makes £57,000. “The cost of living crisis is forcing us to move outside London,” Rose says. “After our son was born we moved to a two-bedroom flat in June 2022, paying £1,500. Our landlord increased the rent to £1,700 last May. We have not been going out since 2022. No dinners, Sunday roasts, or cinema.” Going on maternity leave, Rose says, pushed her into debt she is now repaying. Her son’s nursery bill, £1,200 a month for four days, became unaffordable when the rent went up. “He’s now in nursery only two days a week at £750 a month, and stays with me the rest of the time while I work compressed hours. Although my partner and I both work full-time, we basically earn to pay rent, utility bills, debt and childcare.” Although respondents with children reported more precarious finances than those without, millennial childless couples say they barely have any disposable income either. Lillian, 36, from County Durham, an environmental consultant in the corporate sector says that despite her and her partner’s combined income of £70,000, they are experiencing substantial difficulties, as their doer-upper property has required repairs costing £25,000 so far. “We just feel caught in the middle,” she says. “We find ourselves surviving from paycheck to paycheck, have no savings except pensions. We’ve worked hard, done everything we can to build ourselves up financially, have professional careers, but it’s all fallen flat.” While the couple was fortunate to get a five-year fixed-rate mortgage in the pandemic at only 2%, they are dreading the cost increase when they will have to renew it next year now that the Bank of England base rate has soared to 5.25%. Lillian fears having to work into her 80s. “The Tories have done a lot to erode the benefits of working, from Brexit to interest rates, but I don’t know that I trust any party to improve that. We definitely need a lot more public spending, but it cannot come from my income bracket; we’re completely squeezed.” Lillian believes it should be people such as Lee, 47, a father of four from Surrey who works in tech, who should pay more taxes. Earning about £110,000, he is in the top 2% of earners. “I earn more than I ever did before now and feel very privileged,” he says. “And yet, I feel much poorer now than I did six or seven years ago, when I was only on £50,000, which is crazy.” His wife works part-time as a childminder earning about £700 a month as they cannot afford childcare, Lee says. Like many other respondents, Lee believes in paying taxes, but feels resentful given the state of public services. “Nothing works. You think – where is all this money going? Nothing is getting better. Something’s gotta change. “It’s weird when papers describe the rich and I think – ‘is it people like me?’ I feel jealous of other people when they go on holiday, we can’t afford that. I shop at Aldi, we budget £1,000 a month for food and petrol for our 10-year-old car. We occasionally go to Wetherspoon’s for breakfast. I often think: ‘Is this it?’”"

        "content": "Jacob Rothschild, Lord Rothschild, who has died aged 87, combined a ruthlessly successful business career, following in the family tradition as a financier in the City of London, with philanthropic projects. These mainly centred on the arts and heritage, including the restoration of the dynasty’s enormous 19th-century replica of a French chateau Waddesdon, in the middle of the Buckinghamshire countryside. Although he claimed that for a lot of his life he had lived without luxury – true up to a point following the acrimonious breakup of his parents’ marriage when he was nine – he had a gilded entrance into the family bank, and by last year his wealth, built on shrewd investments and an inheritance, was estimated to be worth at least £825m. He protested to an interviewer that he certainly knew how to open a tin of baked beans, but his portfolio also included the Eythrope estate next to Waddesdon, a share of a vineyard in France, a villa and 30-acre estate on Corfu and a house in Knightsbridge, London. He told the Sunday Times in 2012: “Look, we are not as wealthy as families who live abroad and pay no tax and we are believers in the Great Society. I have spent a large part of my life keeping things going.” He even expressed sympathy for the Occupy movement in the same interview: “You can’t tolerate a society where youth unemployment goes into the high 20%.” The family’s wealth was built up over two centuries, from when Nathan Rothschild was sent from Frankfurt in 1798 to buy Manchester cotton textiles and stayed to set up a counting house in the City of London. It was so successful that it would underwrite the cost of the British army’s campaign at Waterloo and later the purchase of the Suez canal, resulting in a peerage for Jacob’s great-grandfather, another Nathan. Born in Cambridge, Jacob was the son of the zoologist, wartime counter-espionage officer and later Downing Street thinktank head Victor Rothschild and his first wife, the artist Barbara Hutchinson, who was involved with the Bloomsbury set. After the marriage broke down, Victor took out his annoyance on Jacob and his sisters Sarah and Miranda. Jacob suffered a bout of polio and emerged as a diffident, quietly spoken but strong-willed adult. He was educated at Eton and studied history at Christ Church, Oxford, emerging with a first-class degree before undertaking national service in the Life Guards. Instead of the academic career that he might have had, he joined the family firm, the merchant bank NM Rothschild, in 1963, after basic training with other City firms to learn the ropes. In coming years he pressed for the bank to become more adventurous and competitive: “a bank of brains” in seeking and making deals, such as he masterminded in gaining the contract to finance the Trans-Alpine pipeline in the mid-1960s and arranging Grand Metropolitan’s takeover of the brewers Watney Mann (1972).  But when the chairmanship of the bank became vacant in 1976 his father championed his staid older cousin, Evelyn, and Jacob took over the running of the bank’s small investment trust instead. He built it up from a capitalisation of £5m to one with assets of more than £3bn, the largest such trust in Britain by the time he retired in 2019. Not all his deals came off: the attempted Guinness bid for Distillers in 1986 failed spectacularly – though he personally was exonerated of boosting Guinness’s value to assure the takeover. A £13bn attempt to win control of British American Tobacco in partnership with Sir James Goldsmith and the Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer in 1989 also failed. By the late 70s he had bitterly fallen out with Evelyn, sold up his shares in the bank and took the investment trust independent with a new name, J Rothschild Holdings, and a new headquarters in St James’s, where it continued to make deals, eclipsing the bank and benefiting eventually from the privatisation programme of Margaret Thatcher’s government.  Among the companies and acquisitions he bought into were plantations in Asia, property in Paris, the Paypoint electronic system, the Economist magazine and Coats Viyella textiles. In 1988 the company split into St James’s Place Capital and RIT Capital Partners. RIT took a lease on Spencer House, the ancestral London home of Princess Diana’s family, overlooking Green Park, and renovated the property. In 1990 Jacob succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father (who left him only an ink stand in his will). The previous year his cousin, Dollie de Rothschild, had left him her £90m fortune and by then he had also assumed control of the Rothschild Foundation, which runs Waddesdon Manor, the house having been bequeathed to the National Trust in 1957. Rothschild’s cultural philanthropy had been evident for years: Goldsmith said: “It depends which day it is: on one Jacob is an excellent banker, the next he is absorbed by art and heritage.” He himself said he read art catalogues like others read comics, and he was an enthusiastic collector, starting with a Giacometti artwork at the age of 22. He chaired the National Gallery trustees for six years from 1985, commissioning new architects to build the gallery’s extension after Prince Charles criticised the original design as being a monstrous carbuncle. Later he would chair the National Heritage Memorial Fund (1992-98) and the Heritage Lottery Fund (1995-98), enabling the renovation and opening up of Somerset House in central London. A member of the Reform Jewish synagogue and president of the Institute of Jewish Affairs, Rothschild also inherited the family’s Israel charity, Yad Hanadiv, which has funded the building of the Knesset, the Israeli supreme court and national library as well as educational projects for Jewish and Arab children. He was knighted in 1998 and four years later appointed to the Order of Merit. In 1969 he married Serena Dunn. She died in 2019, and he is survived by their four children, Nathaniel, Hannah, Beth and Emily. • Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild, Lord Rothschild, born 29 April 1936; died 26 February 2024"

        "content": "Hipgnosis, the royalties investment fund that offers investors the chance to make money from songs by artists from Beyoncé to Blondie, has cut the value of its music portfolio by more than a quarter in the latest blow for the company. The once high-flying FTSE 250 business, which earns royalties each time one of the thousands of songs to which it owns the rights is played, updated the market on Monday about its continuing strategic review. It also said it would suspend dividends for the foreseeable future and use free cash to pay down debt. Hipgnosis shares, which peaked at 129p in late 2021, fell 11% to 56p in early trading.   Related: Beyoncé and Blondie song fund Hipgnosis needs to find a new tune | Nils Pratley   The company was founded in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, a former manager of acts including Elton John, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé. Hipgnosis has bought catalogues from artists like Neil Young and Red Hot Chili Peppers in an effort to cash in on what it viewed as undervalued assets in the streaming era. However, in recent months it has come under pressure amid valuation concerns and a shareholder revolt against a proposed $440m (£347m) catalogue sale deal. Monday’s statement on the reduction in the fair value of the company’s portfolio followed a report by Shot Tower Capital, which was appointed by the Hipgnosis board to provide an independent valuation of the company’s assets. Shot Tower reviewed the portfolio on a bottom-up basis, analysing the royalty statement data of each of the company’s catalogues and looking at areas such as copyright interests. It gave a midpoint valuation of $1.93bn (£1.52bn) – about 26% lower than the valuation of September 2023. Shot Tower will provide further due diligence findings to the board by 25 March and Hipgnosis expects to provide a further update by 29 March. The company said on Monday after the fresh valuation that it would use its free cashflow to pay down debt and would not recommence dividends for the foreseeable future. Robert Naylor, the chair of Hipgnosis Songs Fund, said the board remained focused on identifying all options to unlock shareholder value. The majority of shareholders voted at an extraordinary general meeting in October last year against Hipgnosis securing another five-year mandate to run as an investment trust. Investors were also unhappy with plans to sell a fifth of the catalogue of 65,000 songs for $440m at a steep discount to book value. In a further sign of the company’s need for cash as it tries to meet its debt obligations, it announced in December that it had sold 20,000 unspecified “non-core” songs for $23.1m, a 14% discount on their valuation in September."

        "content": "Siemens will invest £100m in a new manufacturing centre to replace its Chippenham rail signalling factory in Wiltshire. The German technology company announced on Monday it would build a facility on the site of the existing Chippenham factory, which has been designing and manufacturing signalling and control systems for railways since the 19th century. The Chippenham project is expected to open in 2026 and will be Siemens’ second big investment in a UK manufacturing site in recent years, after it invested £200m in a new train factory in Goole, east Yorkshire, which will open this year. Siemens said the 800 staff who work on the site will be transferred over to the new facility with no impact on production. The site, established in 1897 by signalling contractor Evans O’Donnell, was bought by Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company in 1900 and has produced systems and equipment for the UK and overseas railways ever since. Siemens bought the site in 2013 and continued to design and produce railway systems there, including those used on the Elizabeth line that passes through London. It is now providing digital signalling equipment to modernise the east coast mainline from London to Edinburgh. Rob Morris, the joint CEO of Siemens Mobility UK and Ireland, said: “This investment is a strong commitment to Chippenham and our country. “Siemens Mobility’s Chippenham site, along with our 30 sites across the country, has been transforming rail, travel and transport in Britain – and it will continue to do so with cloud-based rail technology connecting the real and the digital worlds, digitalising rail.” The government said on Sunday it would invest £360m in several manufacturing and research projects in sectors where the UK is, or could be, world-leading. This includes £200m for aerospace research and development schemes aimed at developing zero-carbon aircraft technology, while £120m is being spent on supporting low-carbon manufacturing through the government’s green industries growth accelerator. The latest investment follows the publication of the government’s 47-page advanced manufacturing plan last November, which sets out its long-term proposals for increasing manufacturing output. It is backed by £4.5bn in funding over the next five years, which was announced at the autumn statement. Hunt said: “We’re sticking with our plan by backing the industries of the future with millions of pounds of investment to make the UK a world leader in manufacturing, securing the highly skilled jobs of the future and delivering the long-term change our country needs to deliver a brighter future for Britain.” However, Labour’s shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, criticised the government’s latest funding announcements, saying it was “incapable of providing the long-term stability manufacturing needs to thrive”. He added: “Recycled announcements won’t be enough to turn around the lowest business investment in the G7.”"

        "content": "Dozens of “major” compliance breaches have been unearthed at the Bank of England, despite progress to fix shortcomings after misuse of the central bank’s audio feed by hedge funds four years ago. The report by the National Audit Office (NAO), the public spending watchdog, reviewed the Bank’s actions to improve the handling of non-financial risks, and whether it had learned lessons from two high-profile scandals. That included the 2017 resignation of deputy governor Charlotte Hogg, who failed to declare that her brother worked for Barclays, and an embarrassing security breach in December 2019 that gave hedge funds early access to audio feeds of the Banks press conferences. While the NAO said the central bank had “made good progress” it warned there had been an unacceptable level of compliance breaches of the Bank’s own staff policies over the 12 months to August 2023. These included 28 major breaches, which can be as serious as failing to disclose a conflict of interest that can affect a senior official’s independence, and can result in disciplinary action. They also involved 628 minor breaches, which can refer to an employee’s failure to get advanced approval for personal transactions including mortgages or investments, or emails being sent to the wrong address. It marked a rise from the 584 minor – and 19 major – breaches in the previous year. While most of the breaches were self-reported, the NAO said the figures were “above what the Bank considers an acceptable level”. A 2023 staff survey also found that only 59% of the central bank’s staff felt they were free to speak up without fear of negative consequences. The NAO’s comptroller and auditor general, Gareth Davies, said it was clear “the Bank of England has made good progress in developing new and improved systems to understand and manage compliance risks. “As it takes forward this work, the Bank should ensure it continues to improve the quality and consistency of its risk information, and awareness and confidence among staff to raise concerns.” David Roberts, the chair of the Court of the Bank of England, said he welcomed the NAO report and that the central bank was “committed to promoting the highest standards of integrity and ethics and will carefully consider the NAO’s recommendations”."

        "content": "When City executive Selena* logged on for a Teams call with five senior male colleagues in spring 2021, she was gobsmacked. She had spent weeks warning bosses that the London-based investment firm risked falling foul of European regulations. She had gathered data and presented supporting evidence, but was repeatedly brushed off. “Nobody wanted to listen,” she said. So her jaw dropped that afternoon when a male colleague raised the issue and immediately gained support from the same boss who had ignored her. “I had to stop the meeting,” she recalls. “I said: ‘Why does it take a white, middle-aged man to deliver the exact same message that I’ve been delivering over the last few weeks?’” When her comments were dismissed, and described as “over the top”, it was the final straw. “The realisation was: it doesn’t matter how hard I work, how talented, how committed I am. They will never ever recognise me,” she said. Selena – now in her mid-40s – later resigned, bringing her decades-long career to a temporary halt, and leaving another City executive’s behaviour unchecked. Her story was among those shared by more than 40 women from the financial services industry during a closed-door session of the House of Commons’ Treasury committee’s Sexism in the City inquiry, the report and recommendations of which are due to be released this week. Prompted in part by the sexual harassment allegations against hedge fund boss Crispin Odey, the inquiry is meant to determine whether meaningful progress had been made since the committee’s last review in 2018. But the shocking stories recently shared with MPs for its investigation – which ranged from office bullying to allegations as serious as rape – suggest the post-#MeToo focus on diversity and inclusion has failed to eradicate widespread misogyny. Instead, the “old boys’ club”, according to the committee’s interim report, has been pushed into the shadows. Sexual harassment may be less prevalent in the office, but is more often taking place at conferences and work trips, while bad behaviour has merely become “more underhand and pernicious”, the committee explained. “We have been quite taken aback by just how little things have shifted in the last five years,” said Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair Harriett Baldwin, speaking before the report’s publication.   Related: Harriett Baldwin: the fund manager turned Tory MP fighting sexism in the City   There were hopes the dial might move thanks to a post-pandemic boom in flexible working, mandatory gender pay gap reporting, as well as the voluntary uptake of the women in finance charter – the companies who sign up must set targets for boosting diversity in their senior ranks. Unfortunately, little had changed by the time 26-year-old Victoria* joined a large global bank through a graduate scheme in 2019. She felt prepared for a career in a male-dominated industry, having studied computer sciences and watched both her parents navigate roles in the City. “But I don’t know if I entirely expected it to be so alienating,” Victoria said. She found herself regularly dodging bosses’ comments about whether male colleagues were her boyfriends and was criticised for being “chatty”. But she pushed on, and was hired as one of three women on a 60-strong quants team – which involves banks using complex mathematical models to price financial products. Despite her enthusiasm, and requests to attend regular meetings to understand team goals, she felt repeatedly shut out. “I was told to just sit there and be quiet. It’s not something women want to be told.” Victoria’s role was later made redundant, and she has since moved out of the sector. Experiences like Victoria’s have left MPs wondering whether a hyper-focus on boosting female leadership – while it is an important piece of the puzzle – has allowed firms to avoid tackling other harmful employment practices. “A lot of the people that want to make it better think that just having more women will make it better,” the Labour MP and fellow committee member Angela Eagle said. “And they’re not looking at the power relationships, and how earnings and incentives work in particular bits of the sector … so I still think there’s been a misanalysis of what needs to be done.” There are also concerns that smaller firms such as boutique investment and hedge funds have been able to avoid scrutiny, as they are exempt from pay gap reporting and proposals to force larger City firms to report diversity strategies and targets. It puts those smaller firms at greater risk of harbouring the worst offenders, Baldwin said. “You’d have a harder time recommending to your daughter that she go and work for some of these firms, than you might for some of the big corporates,” said the MP, who herself was the target of inappropriate behaviour early in her career at JP Morgan. Julie, a 40-year veteran of the insurance industry, said a ban on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and gagging orders, which protect the reputation of the worst-offending firms, could be one simple fix. She spent the first few decades of her career navigating bouts of bullying, being sidelined after her maternity leave, and feeling forced to sign an NDA that left her unable to challenge one employer’s dismissal. But Julie did not expect further discrimination when she joined a new broker in 2018. Her team leader was a younger man, but any hope that he would take a more progressive approach was quickly dashed. Requests to work from home met severe scrutiny, and she was pushed to make up time for attending hospital appointments. When she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, that boss sent helpline and hospice care leaflets to Julie’s husband. “He was just awful,” she said. She then watched on as he was hired by another firm, and placed on its diversity committee. “There’s still a long way to go. Men get away with a lot.” Any palpable change could hinge on whether Baldwin’s Treasury committee is willing to give the recommendations in its report – aimed at government and City regulators – some teeth. The committee’s 2018 review, published under its former chair, Nicky Morgan, raised worthwhile concerns about the City’s pervasive “alpha male” culture, as well as how the structure of bonus payouts and a focus on presenteeism had deterred and disadvantaged women in finance. But more glaring, in hindsight, were its omissions. There was no reference to the scandal that unfolded months earlier around the men-only Presidents Club dinner, where hired hostesses were allegedly groped and sexually harassed by the invited businessmen and bankers. None either of the impact of the #MeToo movement, which gathered pace in 2017 as women in all industries across the world began sharing personal stories of sexual harassment on social media. Baldwin has promised that her report will feature “actionable recommendations”: “This is going to be very much a summary of some progress, but very much ‘work in progress’.” But the committee’s ultimate goal, Eagle added, is that it will be the last report of its kind. “I hope that in five years, we won’t have to do this again,” she said. *Not her real name"

        "content": "It is one of those wearily baffling days on the railway. “The trains …” sighs a woman on the platform at Gatwick, where a huddle of us stare glumly at the cancellations and delays on the departures screen. “What can you do?” At that moment, I should be 25 miles away, asking that very question of one woman who really can do something: Angie Doll, chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). The operating company carries almost one in five UK rail passengers – around 5 million every week – across its Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express trains. And Doll, arguably Britain’s most senior woman in rail since being promoted to the GTR top job in November, believes she can turn around the train service for customers again. That change of role has afforded her a couple more hours’ sleep the night before we finally meet at Brighton station. At 4am, a power failure meant GTR taking the decision to cancel all Southern trains from London to Brighton, and most Thameslink ones too. Not long ago, Doll would have been the one making the night-time call on the ­latest snafu. Now she gets the news on the WhatsApp group when she wakes. Most might welcome the peace but Doll says “one of the hardest things is taking that step back”, and leaving operations to her team. Her new role means setting strategy for the coming years. Many in rail feel the industry is at its lowest ebb in a long time, battered by Covid, cuts, strikes, stagnating promises of reform, and ever-rising fares: they went up another 4.9% on Sunday. Doll, though, is upbeat: “We’re on the cusp of a big change in rail: we have to be clear about our purpose and where we’ve got to go.” Whether or not the draft bill to set up Great British Railways will pass before a new government is elected, Doll believes either Conservatives or Labour will push forward reform: “There are lots of things that they are absolutely aligned on – and the industry agrees. We do need a guiding mind, we do need a longer strategy, and we do need to be more customer-focused and address where we are with fares. The difference now is their mechanism and how they get there.” Of the quarter-century of the industry she has worked through, she says, “I feel this is almost the most exciting time. The railway … does absolutely need to think of the passenger in a different way than they ever did before, because working from home is established now.” Many GTR customers would have gladly ripped up their season tickets to work from home long before the pandemic made it possible. Southern Rail was a byword for train hell in 2016-17, when Doll was in the fray as passenger services director. An ill-prepared GTR mega-franchise was firefighting on several fronts, leaving commuters on overcrowded, unreliable trains – even before Southern was embroiled in the worst strikes since privatisation, over driver-only operation of trains. Doll became a bete noire of the rail unions as Southern pioneered the role of the onboard supervisor – or downgraded the role of guard, according to competing views. “With Southern in 2016, I was saying it was better for our customer, and these are jobs that will stand the test of time,” she says. “Now I’ve got a legacy that says: I’m doing things that are in the best interests of our people and customers.” That could also apply to the introduction of new Thameslink trains. They were at the heart of the 2018 timetable fiasco that saw one of Doll’s predecessors forced out, and their spartan carriages, with hard seats and without proper tables, caused consternation among commuters when introduced. Doll sees it differently: “Those trains, they’re like hoovers. They’re great – you see them come in and they just hoover everybody up from the platform.”   I often get asked what it’s like to be a woman in a male organisation  Angie Doll    And many are happy to be hoovered, she says: “From a passenger experience, they’re a great train to travel on because they absolutely do what they say on the tin – it’s mass transit, moving lots of passengers very quickly and creating that space. It’s a more comfortable experience, especially if you have to stand for short distances.” She became Southern’s managing director in 2019, overseeing its renaissance from strife-torn laggard to operator of the year in 2021. Her strategy was, she says, “building the bridges with unions and staff, stabilising the business, then improve to be the best. You have to give people a sense of direction and where they’re going, and show them the building blocks along the way.” Doll came into rail after a long stint in the holiday industry, working up from rep to boss in the Canaries: “When I went on holiday with my mum at 14, I told my mum, ‘I don’t want to be an air hostess any more, I want to be a rep – because they get to stay’.” It was a good grounding, she says: “It prepares you for anything because people put such high expectations on holidays. And made me realise that the purpose of a journey is more important than the journey itself. That helps you look at it from a completely different point of view.” Nevertheless, she faced questions when she started her rail life in Brighton as station manager: “People often ask me what it’s like to be a woman in a male organisation. When I joined, the biggest thing was ‘how can you be a station manager if you haven’t done the job before?’. The currency is your history and experience – you really get accepted after about 10 years.” About 140 people at GTR alone will collect awards this year from Doll for reaching 25 years of service, and “next year, I’ll be signing my own certificate!” But while long rail careers are common, Doll says: “We do need to modernise. There’s a very established way of thinking and of how people want to work. When you want to make changes, even if they are small changes, you really need to take people on the journey with you. You have to demonstrate the value – and people only see it when it comes in.” CV Age 58Family Married, with a stepdaughter.Education Comprehensive school in Bristol, left at 17 “with several O-levels”.Salary Declined to say.Last holiday Skiing in Cervinia, Italy, with a group of girlfriends.Best advice she’s been given “‘Be authentic’ – from my executive coach.”Biggest career mistake “I don’t regret anything I’ve done.” But she nearly turned down a job (at High Speed One) that was “the best I ever had”.Phrase she overuses “Will this make our boat go faster?”How she relaxes Yoga every morning, walking."

        "content": "Britain’s sharp regional divide is on track to deepen with London’s economy pulling further ahead despite the government’s levelling up promises, according to a report. Ahead of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s budget on Wednesday, the accountancy firm EY said it was forecasting stronger economic growth in London and the wider south-east of England than for the rest of the country. Overall it said economic growth across the UK would average 1.9% a year between 2024 and 2027 – spurred by lower inflation, a strong jobs market and the prospect of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. However, London and the south-east would grow by 2% and 2.1%, respectively – above every other region, and significantly stronger than in the north-east of England, Wales and Scotland where growth would average closer to 1.5%. Despite levelling up efforts, it said London and the south-east would increase their overall contribution to the UK economy from 39% in 2023 to 40% in 2027, having already increased from 36% in 2005. Rohan Malik, UK and Ireland managing partner for government and infrastructure at EY, said the benefits of economic growth “will not be felt equally across the country” amid a worsening regional growth gap. “The UK’s longstanding geographic inequalities mean that many of the country’s high-growth sectors have coalesced around a select few locations, and these areas will reap the biggest rewards as the country returns to prosperity in the coming years,” he said.   Related: Britain’s inequalities are growing and levelling up is difficult. Here’s why   It comes after the Guardian revealed fewer than a fifth of levelling-up projects approved by Michael Gove to improve towns across England have been completed, in the latest sign of stalling progress for the government’s flagship 2019 election promise. Britain’s economy fell into recession at the end of 2023 as households reined in spending amid the cost of living crisis. However, some areas were hit harder than others, with EY warning that regions where average incomes tended to be lower suffered sharper falls in economic activity, including Wales, Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and the Humber. Separate figures from the CBI lobby group show private sector activity continued to fall in the three months to February, with output now either flat or falling since August 2022. Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said Wednesday’s budget presented the chancellor with an opportunity to remove barriers to growth and “double down” on high-growth sectors. Saying that activity was expected to strengthen in the next three months, he added: “There’s an opening for the government to capitalise on that momentum and put the country on a path to sustainable growth.” However, EY warned that a lack of targeted regional support and concentration of high-value economic activities in some parts of the UK – such as professional services and technology – meant the recovery was likely to exacerbate regional divisions. It said three of the five slowest growing areas from 2024 to 2027 are expected to be in the north of England, with Aberdeen (0.8% annual average growth), Blackpool (1.1%), Warrington (1.3%), Cumberland (1.3%) and Dundee (1.4%) trailing the rest of the UK. The accountancy firm forecast Reading would overtake Manchester as the UK’s fastest-growing location, with annual growth of 2.5% between 2024 and 2027 fuelled by the town’s position on the M4 corridor enabling it to benefit from an expansion in the technology sector. The wider Thames Valley and locations including Windsor and Maidenhead would also benefit from an expansion in big tech. Manchester and Bristol were expected to follow with average growth of 2.2% each over the next three years. Progress would be more mixed in other sectors, including a weaker performance in manufacturing – which typically contributes a larger share of economic activity in places outside London and the south-east. Peter Arnold, UK chief economist at EY, said the UK’s economic prospects were likely to improve as families benefited from lower energy prices and interest cuts from the Bank of England. “The UK’s economic prospects for 2025 and 2026 appear even brighter, but this return to moderate growth is unlikely to be balanced across the country.”"

        "content": "Ministers are trying to install a highly paid rail industry figure in the Department for Transport to entrench plans to create Great British Railways (GBR) before the general election. The DfT could break Whitehall’s pay structure to create the senior post, in an attempt to accelerate changes for a new public body managing the country’s rail transport – although the Treasury is reluctant to sanction another DfT salary beyond normal pay grades. It comes as rail fares in England and Wales rose by 4.9% on Sunday, which ministers said was “striking a balance”, with the railway still requiring large public subsidy. Labour said it meant fares had risen by 66% since 2010, almost twice as fast as wages. A new director general overseeing the integrated railway would sit above current rail mandarins, to mirror the setup of the Conservatives’ planned GBR – a move that could slow or hinder Labour’s own eventual overhaul plans, some fear. Transport ministers and GBR transition team leaders are backing a reorganisation that could recruit an industry figure earning well above the department’s permanent secretary. The DfT declined to comment on what it called an individual human resources matter. A government source said the department was continually adapting its structures to support the delivery of rail services, including the rail reform plan. Progress in setting up GBR has foundered in the past on the division between the DfT and the Treasury over the powers of a semi-autonomous body. The changes aim to align “track and train” within the industry, by bringing together Network Rail, which manages the infrastructure, in an integrated rail body that would also oversee train operations and possibly award contracts. A draft rail reform bill was published last month, which the rail minister, Huw Merriman, said he believed could still become law, despite the apparent lack of legislative time before an election. Labour has yet to outline its own policy, bar a promise to take train operations into public ownership as contracts expire. Although some fear ministers are trying to entrench changes that could stymie a new government, Labour has also spoken of establishing a unifying body and a source suggested a DfT restructure could fit with its eventual plans. The DfT proposals could yet be blocked by the Treasury, which has sought to control escalating rail spending. The cost of setting up GBR alone has risen from £205m to a forecast £381m. The highest-paid senior officials on the public payroll have long come from rail, with the list currently headed by Andrew Haines, the leader of the Great British Railways transition team and boss of Network Rail, earning £589,000 according to government figures published in July 2023. The DfT also has form in directly employing within the department an official on an extraordinary salary. Peter Wilkinson, the managing director of passenger services, who was permanently hired to improve rail franchising in 2014, earns £265,000. Candidates in the frame for the new post could be drawn from the senior managerial ranks of Network Rail, all earning about £330,000, such as Alex Hynes, who is already running Scotland’s railway as a more integrated system. The DfT did not confirm or deny moves, but a government source said it would ensure value for money for the taxpayer."

        "content": "In the two weeks either side of lunar new year, Mandy Ho, who manages a hot air balloon company in Melbourne, has many balls in the air. Most mornings before dawn, when weather permits, her colleagues fly Chinese tourists from the vineyards of the Yarra Valley over Melbourne’s eastern suburbs to parkland on the city’s fringe. Interpreters make sure nothing is lost in translation. Ho has spent weeks preparing tourists and arranging buses to collect them from hotels. She’s already met some of them while running the company’s Mandarin smartphone app, website and Chinese social media channels.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But this year, she’s noticed a shift. Ho says Chinese tourist numbers are still down by about half when compared with pre-pandemic levels. It’s a financial hit for the company, Global Ballooning, as the Chinese market brings in about 50% of its clients. “I was expecting a full recovery this year as it’s the first year they can travel overseas for Chinese new year,” Ho says. “But it’s been a much slower recovery than what we expected.” Ho isn’t the only tourism operator disappointed by the sluggish return of Chinese tourists. Tourism Australia figures show 102,000 Chinese holidaymakers visited Australia in September 2023. Four years earlier, the number was 688,000 in the same month. “I think there’s a few reasons for this,” Ho says. “The economy in China isn’t great and a lot of people are choosing to go to Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia because they’re visa-free. This is the first year they’ve been able to travel since the pandemic and they’re preferring short-haul flights.” Ho’s analysis is supported by statistics from booking platform Trip.com, which has reported a 30% increase in Chinese tourism to south-east Asia in recent weeks, compared with 2019 levels. Trips to Hong Jong, Japan and South Korea have also increased. As Chinese tourists take their money elsewhere, Ho and other tourism providers have had to get creative. “We tried not to put all our eggs in the one basket,” Ho says. “We diversified our market and this year we’re seeing a lot people coming back from the United States, from Taiwan and Hong Kong, too.” ‘We’re not hitting alarm bells just yet’ Peter Shelley from the Australian Tourism Export Council, a peak body for tourism operators, says many of his members are also disappointed but are not panicking. “If we are honest, I think we were all hoping it would be a little bit more buoyant. It was never going to be 100%, we hoped it would be about 75%,” Shelley says. “Are we worried about it? I don’t think anyone is hitting the alarm bells just yet. It’s still early days, and maybe by the end of the year we’ll be back to 2019 levels.”   Related: As China’s economy stalls, Australia braces for the impact on its currency and tourism market   Shelley says many Chinese consumers now realise Australia is an expensive country to visit and fly to. This month, there’s about 170 scheduled flights between China and Australia. That’s 86% of all flights during the same month in 2019. Tourism Australia, a government agency that promotes holiday making, knows what’s at stake. In 2019, Chinese visitors spent $12.4m in Australia. The agency hopes tourism will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, despite Oxford Economics suggesting that may not happen until 2025-26. “[While] travel with China reopened a year later than other markets, we are confident about its recovery as the market continues to steadily rebuild,” a Tourism Australia spokesperson says. But some experts are concerned by anecdotal evidence this past fortnight. Dr Paul Stolk, a senior lecturer in tourism at Newcastle University, says this lunar new year was a litmus test on the health of the Chinese market. “This is the period of time where we should see a lot of activity,” Stolk says. “This period we are in right now could be really telling in terms of whether we will see any bounce back and where it will occur, including capital cities and regional hotspots.” ‘We’ve been back to normal’ The Great Ocean Road – a long winding roadway that hugs the south-eastern Victorian coastline over steep cliffs – is usually filled with busloads of Chinese tourists. For years, signs by the side of the road have reminded Chinese tourists to drive in the left lane. Before the pandemic, some restaurants in coastal towns along this road printed menus in Mandarin. After years of lockdowns, many business owners hoped the Chinese tourists would rush back to the coastline and help them rebound. Liz Price, the general manager of Great Ocean Road Regional Tourism, acknowledges the Chinese tourism market has been slow to recover in the region. But she says recent weeks give some cause for optimism. “We have had some reports that the numbers have increased over the summer and there has been some growth in coaches day-tripping out of Melbourne,” Price says.   Related: Chinese tourists to resume group travel to Australia in latest thawing of relations between countries   This may be due to the Australian government reissuing group visas for Chinese travellers in September. Dr Maneka Jayasinghe, a tourism expert at Charles Darwin University, says this should lead to an increase in tourists in coming months. Sally Cannon, who runs the Apollo Bay Bakery about two-and-a-half hours drive west of Melbourne, which claims to be the home of the scallop pie on the Great Ocean Road, is also optimistic. Unlike Ho, Cannon has noticed an increase in Chinese tourists over the last two weeks. So, too, have other business owners closer to Melbourne, in Lorne. Cannon says she’s hopeful the numbers will continue to rise. “Pre-Covid, Chinese tourists were a big part of our business,” Cannon says. “Over the past few years, we’ve managed to continue without them, but it’s nice to see them return. “This has been the first year since Covid where it’s felt we’ve been back to normal. I just have this feeling it will continue.” ‘It was like a green light’ Like many sections of the Australian economy, political tensions between Beijing and Canberra have had some impact on tourism. But analysts differ on the how significant the influence has been. Tom Parker, the chief executive of the Australia China Business Council, says tensions may have played a role in tourism numbers until prime minister Anthony Albanese’s trip to Beijing in November – the first by an Australian leader in seven years. “Symbolism is important in China,” Parker says. “This trip certainly symbolised a lot within China, including that it was OK to engage with Australia again. It was like a green light. These things are never said directly, but the visit, at that leadership level, told a story.” Shelley says the impact of geopolitical tensions would have been clearer if the borders had been open during the pandemic era. “If we were talking about this a few years ago, I think the impact would have been quite high,” Shelley says. “I must say, the current government has smoothed the waters but there could still be an undertone of tension.” Ho believes the enduring appeal of the Australian landscape will always attract tourists from China, no matter the political climate. She just hopes they won’t wait too long to return. “I definitely think they will come back,” Ho says. “There’s just so much to offer. By the end of this year, I’m sure the numbers will have increased.”"

        "content": "When Clement Attlee took soundings from his cabinet on the timing of the 1950 election, the then chancellor, Sir Stafford Cripps, was adamant. The Labour government had to go to the country before the budget so that voters did not think the decisions made had been taken with polling day in mind. Those were the days. As the 2024 budget approaches on Wednesday, the assumption is that Jeremy Hunt will do his utmost to deliver a crowd-pleasing package of tax cuts. The chancellor has done his utmost to hose down those expectations, telling the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that he was preparing for a prudent and responsible, gimmick-free affair. Taxes should be lower, he argued, but only when affordable. Even so, the Treasury has been exploring every avenue in its attempt to find a way of putting more money in the pockets of consumers while sticking to its self-imposed rule to be cutting debt as a share of national income in five years’ time. Experience suggests this strategy won’t work. For a start, the sums involved will be relatively modest. The size of Hunt’s net giveaway on Wednesday is likely to be a maximum of £10bn, which is small beer in the context of a £2.5tn-a-year economy. The package will be smaller than last November’s autumn statement, which made no difference to the Conservative party’s dire opinion poll ratings. Budgets actually matter a lot less than is assumed at Westminster. Most are forgotten quickly, and the ones that stick in the mind tend to do so for the wrong reasons. The most memorable fiscal event of the current parliament – Kwasi Kwarteng’s tax-cutting extravaganza in September 2022 – was not even a proper budget. Giveaway budgets only work politically if they feel consistent with the economy’s direction of travel. In 1987, for example, Nigel Lawson was able to cut taxes because growth was strong, inflation was low, people were seeing their living standards rise, and the public finances were in good shape. Lawson cut the basic rate of income tax from 29% to 27% but he also cut government borrowing. The deep recession of the early 1980s seemed a long way in the past, although the scars persist to this day. Three months after the budget, Margaret Thatcher won her third election, with a majority of more than 100.   Related: Jeremy Hunt’s seat under threat as voters put NHS ahead of tax perks   Hunt is in a more difficult position. The economy is in recession. Inflation is coming down but, at 4%, still double the government’s target. National output per head of population – a reasonable guide to living standards – has not risen in any of the past seven quarters and has fallen in six of them. The government will borrow upwards of £100bn this year to balance the books. On the upside, the recession has been a lot milder than most forecasters were predicting a year ago, and is probably already over. A good leading indicator is the housing market, where activity and prices have both turned upwards. Inflation has come down more quickly than expected and unemployment has remained low. As Hunt said on Kuenssberg, the economy has shown some resilience in the face of three big shocks in the current parliament – the Covid pandemic, the cost of living crisis and the Ukraine war – and is now on the road to recovery. The next few months should see confirmation of that. But clearly the economy is not in a 1987-style sweet spot, or anything like it. Even if living standards now start to rise again, there will be a lag before voters feel any improvement. If the economy is indeed on the turn, it may well be Rachel Reeves rather than the current chancellor who benefits from the lower borrowing that stronger growth will deliver. Hunt has spent his time at the Treasury seeking to calm things down after Liz Truss spooked the markets with her unfunded tax cuts, and rather than pump-up demand has concentrated on measures to boost investment and labour market participation. In that context, the obsession with using the budget as a vehicle for tax cuts looks strange, and may prove counterproductive. An alternative strategy would be for Hunt to face down his noisy backbenchers and say that tax cuts are neither really affordable nor his current priority. If there is money available he should spend it on mending broken Britain: reducing NHS waiting lists, mending potholes, preventing more councils from going bust. Taxes may be at their highest level for seven decades but that is not what appears to be bugging the public. Rather, it is that they are paying considerably more tax but getting little in return. Hunt believes the only sustainable way to meet public demands for better quality public services is to speed up the economy’s growth rate. So he would be better off ignoring the fact that this is a pre-election budget and instead concentrate on measures to improve the supply side of the economy, such as reducing the record number of people inactive due to long-term ill health. This would be a political risk but not much of one, given that the likely outcomes for the Conservatives in the election are defeat and landslide defeat. Voters may respect Hunt more for sticking to a long-term approach. If things look markedly better in six months’ time than now, that would be the moment to show some generosity. It’s not going to happen of course. Hunt wants to have it both ways. He will talk about taking decisions for the long term, while at the same time scrabbling around to find the cash for pre-election tax cuts. He runs the risk of getting an adverse reaction from the markets which would snuff out what is still a lukewarm and tentative economic recovery."

        "content": "When Ian Harrison returned to the Lincolnshire coast to care for his parents a decade ago, he didn’t expect to spend his own retirement fighting plans to dig a £50bn nuclear waste dump near the beaches of his childhood. Harrison, 67, lives a mile from the village of Theddlethorpe, one of three sites in England being examined for a possible geological disposal facility (GDF) to handle decades of nuclear waste from the power and defence industries. The cavernous dump will feature a series of tunnels and vaults dug 200-1,000 metres underground, capable of holding high-risk nuclear waste. “It’s just a terrible idea to put a nuclear dump next to a seaside resort,” says Harrison, a retired warrant officer. “The safety concerns are real – look at Chernobyl – but people are more worried about the tourism that comes to Mablethorpe and the impact on local businesses.”  Interactive  After several sites fell out of contention, the former gas terminal in Lincolnshire is one of just three which remain, with two on the Cumbrian coast – Mid Copeland and South Copeland. There is speculation about another site on the north-west coast. The search for a home for Britain’s nuclear waste underlines a problem at the heart of its energy ambitions. Politicians have extolled the virtues of low-carbon nuclear power, but little attention has been given to the question of where to put the resulting waste.  Allerdale in Cumbria was ruled out last September after the government body behind the GDF project, Nuclear Waste Services (NWS), said there was “only a limited volume of suitable rock”, meaning it was not safe for storage. Last month, councillors in East Yorkshire withdrew from a process to consider hosting a GDF at South Holderness, east of Hull. In 2021, a council leader in Hartlepool resigned in a similar GDF row. “At South Holderness, the local population complained and the council listened and stopped it,” says Harrison. “Here, people are worried, but they are sugarcoating it and not taking into account local concerns. Eventually, this will end up with a shortlist of one: us.” The GDF is forecast to cost between £20bn and £53bn. Work on the project could take decades to begin, and high-risk waste will not enter it until at least 2075. The cost will be met by taxpayers, the existing nuclear plants’ operator EDF, and future power station operators. Work on the GDF is expected to 4,000 jobs in its first 25 years. It is not an unprecedented move – Finland is nearing completion of a 450-metre-deep cavern to store its waste. France, Canada, Switzerland and Sweden are making progress on similar projects. Britain’s nuclear waste is largely generated by its ageing power stations, as well as by industrial and defence sectors. It is housed in more than 20 ground-level sites which can hold the waste for up to 100 years, meaning a permanent store needs to be found. Even more waste is expected to be generated from a new era of reactors, despite lengthy delays,starting with Hinkley Point C in Somerset, currently the only new UK station under construction. The handling of nuclear waste in Britain was put in the spotlight last year when the Guardian published Nuclear Leaks, a year-long investigation into problems with cyber­security, safety and a “toxic” culture at Sellafield. Most of the waste now at the Cumbria site will be sent to a GDF, probably between 2050 and 2125. While it can be argued that the Copeland sites have communities familiar with nuclear waste, it is an alien industry for Theddlethorpe, where geologists are studying the clay rock under the seabed. Proponents of a GDF at Theddlethorpe, where a facility would be built onshore and the store tunnelled under the sea six miles off the coast, argue it will bring not only jobs but investment – in flood defences, road improvements and rail links. Detractors say its largely retired community will barely contribute to the workforce, and its holiday parks will play host only to construction workers while tourism slowly dies. A government gaffe in which Skegness was wrongly spelled as “Skegross” on a map did little to engender local support. Ken Smith, a retired former lecturer and chair of the Guardians of the East Coast pressure group, says: “People call us nimbys and tell us that we’re only interested in the impact on house prices, but that’s a red herring. It’s about the people who live here and the way this could change their lives.”  Interactive  A test of public support for the Theddlethorpe project is likely to be conducted in 2027. Jon Collins, the independent chair of the Theddlethorpe GDF Community Partnership, says only a small number of the 10,000 people who live in the search area have yet expressed an opinion. “There are a lot of people who have yet to engage. People deserve the opportunity to have a proper debate with all the facts before a decision is made.” In Mid Copeland, David Moore, 70, a retired farmer, says local support for the project has increased in recent years. “Our community has been brought up handling radioactive waste,” says Moore, a representative on the Mid Copeland GDF community partnership. “We have a highly skilled workforce, and know it brings highly paid jobs.” Residents in nearby South Copeland are more circumspect, he claims. A contentious element of the project has been the £1m a year in funds offered to prospective sites, handed out by NWS. Spending has included £382,067 for an adventure playground, garden and CCTV at the village halls; £49,981 on a project to reduce loneliness; and £26,102 to the Parrot Zoo Trust. Some locals see the taxpayer money as a “bribe”; others argue the money might as well be taken while the debate continues. Collins says any final decision needs to take into account both local opinion and the best geological conditions for the site. But Smith says: “A GDF is simply sweeping the problem under the carpet. My worry is that I want future generations to enjoy what I have I can take my grandchildren for a picnic on the beach: you can’t do that at Sellafield. I do not want the area to be torn apart. If they industrialise this coastline then all that enjoyment will be lost.” NWS said: “A GDF will only be built where there is a suitable site and a willing community. This is a consent-based process and we are committed to giving local people all the information they need, listening to all voices and letting local people have their say on the topic.” • This article was amended on 5 March 2024 because an accompanying map graphic referred to South Holderness, Lincolnshire whereas it is in East Yorkshire."

        "content": "When Alan Bates took his campaign for justice to Westminster again last week, it would not just have been the hundreds of post office operators he represents who would have been pleased by his persistence. Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV, will doubtless be delighted at the wide-ranging political impact of the broadcaster’s hit drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which ignited public anger over the slow-burning Horizon scandal. As she prepares to present annual results this week, the jury is still out on McCall’s strategy as she attempts to counter the inevitable long-term decline in traditional TV viewership with growth in digital audiences. The Bates drama pulled in 4 million viewers an episode when it was shown, and a further 10 million through the channel’s on-demand service, ITVX. For McCall, a former boss of easyJet and Guardian Media Group, the show’s success provides a welcome fillip six years into her tenure. After navigating the strains of the pandemic, she now faces a torrid advertising market and a fall in the share price. Helpfully, the Post Office dramatisation has emphasised one of ITV’s strong suits. “Mr Bates demonstrates there is still a very large audience for typical high-quality drama. That’s what broadcasters can deliver,” says Shore Capital analyst Roddy Davidson. “ITV is still a strong proposal for advertisers: it’s mass-market, proven and trusted. There are none of the issues with misrepresentation found elsewhere.” The broadcaster has a decent track record in “social purpose drama” – see last year’s take on the 1989 Hillsborough disaster – and will hope to repeat the Mr Bates feat with Peter Moffat’s forthcoming drama on the contaminated blood scandal. ITV’s update on Thursday will act as a barometer for the state of the advertising market, as will Tuesday’s annual results from Reach, the owner of the Mirror, Express and Star newspaper s. Its recent indicators have been gloomy – 450 jobs have gone and there was an angry staff backlash against its chief executive before Christmas. Elsewhere in TV, the ad slump has been reflected in the biggest round of job cuts at Channel 4 in more than 15 years. Shore Capital expects ITV’s annual TV advertising revenues to be down about 10%, reflecting a bleak year when the cost of living crisis and weak consumer confidence hurt big brands’ spending. McCall also spent the year fighting fires. First there were calls to drop presenter Jeremy Clarkson over an article he wrote in the Sun, then came Phillip Schofield’s summer resignation from This Morning, which catapulted McCall in front of MPs to explain her handling of the situation. And a reported £1.5m shelled out to get Nigel Farage on I’m a Celebrity appeared to return little on its investment. Meanwhile, concerns over the future of traditional TV are weighing on the shares. Analysis by research firm Enders found that broadcast TV viewing fell 3%, to two hours 28 minutes per person a day, in 2023 compared with the previous year. Younger audiences were down 80% on pre-pandemic levels.  ITV’s share price has halved since its 2022 announcement that it would spend big to revamp its streaming service. ITVX launched at the end of 2022 and the company spent £160m on digital-first content in 2023. In January, Mr Bates and the crime thriller Trigger Point helped it land a record 315m streams. The early signs are that the company should hit a target to draw in £750m in digital revenue, largely via ITVX, by 2026. Despite this, “the market is in wait-and-see mode with ITVX,” says Davidson. “It’s a step forward on the previous offer but we need to see some hard figures on streaming and subscriber numbers. There need to be signs it is being taken seriously by advertisers and viewers.” With a chill wind blowing through the industry, streamers including Netflix have cut back on budgets. McCall does not appear tempted to acquire production companies to secure future hits, although she did consider snapping up All3Media, the maker of Fleabag, which was eventually bought last month for £1.15bn by the Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI, which is also trying to complete a takeover of the Telegraph. The picture could soon be brighter: Britain is expected to come out of recession and the Euro 2024 football tournament looks likely to pull in greater advertising and viewers to ITV’s terrestrial output. Some good news came last week in an unexpected form. ITV announced the sale of its 50% stake in its patriotic streaming service, BritBox, to its joint venture partner, BBC Studios. Viewed as a niche consideration by analysts, the deal for the channel, home to classic shows from Fawlty Towers to Line of Duty, raked in £255m in cash, a figure which surprised industry watchers and sent the shares soaring, as the proceeds will be handed to investors. McCall will hope those shareholders will show similar patience to Bates, and stick with ITV for the long haul against an uncertain backdrop."

It seems to me to capture the feelings of so many people I meet or who write to me. We are of course still part of the continent of Europe, and always will be, but the European Economic Community, or the European Union it became, would not fit so well in such a neat, Ogden Nash-style verse. We know what he means when he says we are now outside Europe. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, knows too, as he dots the i’s and crosses the t’s on his much-trailed budget, to be unveiled – finally! – on Wednesday. Hunt was a Remainer and fully aware of the self-harm, and indeed absurdity, of Brexit. With the Office for Budget Responsibility estimating a hit to the economy of 4% of GDP, Goldman Sachs putting it at 5%, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research calculating up to 6%, Hunt knows that anything up to £40bn (the Centre for European Reform estimate) may have been knocked off the “headroom” he has for budgetary concessions. The tax-cutting Brexiters have been hoist by their own petard. A combination of speculation and inspired – or uninspired – leaks has produced a situation where Hunt is said to have limited scope for tax cuts. But the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that the kind of tax cuts the Tories want would have to be counterbalanced by reductions in public expenditure. And this at a time when the budgets of so many public services have been pared to the bone. As the IFS says: “The economic case for tax cuts is weak. The public finances remain in a poor position.” The irony is that the foresee­able strains on much-needed public spending indicate that taxes will have to rise to enable the nation to cope with the many demands now being made on the public weal. The International Monetary Fund says the same. Yet neither main party admits this. It is obvious that the government, with all this stuff about tax cuts to help working people, wishes to bribe the electorate by claiming to ease the hardship imposed by cost of living pressures, while effecting this at the cost of even more austerity in the public sector. In fact, the main beneficiaries of tax cuts would be middle- and upper-income earners, not “hard-pressed working people”.   The problems facing the country demand an Attlee-style grasp of the need for bold measures   This ailing government is presumably making the cynical political calculation that short-term tax relief is worth trying even at the cost of yet more austerity. Older readers may recall that early on in the post-2010 era of austerity, I quoted my late friend David Cornwell, aka John le Carré, who told me: “It’s planned penury.” And so it turned out for so many people in this benighted country. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was recently quoted by my colleague Larry Elliott as saying: “The next government – Conservative or Labour – will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.” The problems facing the country do evoke parallels with the immediate post-1945 situation. Moreover, they demand an Attlee-style grasp of the need for bold measures, starting with a vast investment programme founded not on the kind of fiscal rules that imply continued austerity, but on the assumption that sensible investment pays dividends if you take the long view, and are not hidebound by annual budgets and arbitrarily chosen fiscal rules. The Attlee government knew about the need for regional policy, well described in the memoirs of Douglas Jay, a prominent member of Attlee’s cabinet. Regional policy is now known as “devolution”. Under the auspices of Harvard University and King’s College London, a new report examining the UK’s feeble growth performance argues in favour of a more equitable regional balance, with more power given to local leaders throughout the regions. At a panel discussion on the report, Sir John Kingman, a former senior Treasury official, and now chairman of Legal & General, complained that international investors get a poor reception here. Brexit, I could not help thinking. He said – I suspect only half-jokingly – that Gordon Brown’s chancellorship had brought lots of money to the regions but no devolution, whereas George Osborne’s brought plenty of devolution but no money. Yes, Osborne was the chief begetter of Le Carré’s “planned penury”, and if Labour win they will be saddled with the consequences, as Reeves knows only too well."

        "content": "There are budgets that fall apart within minutes of the chancellor delivering his Commons speech: think of George Osborne’s pasty tax, one of many missteps that meant his 2012 budget will be forever known as an omnishambles. Then there are the “poison pill” budgets: the ones that come at the end of a parliament, when the chancellor of the day goes for broke – sometimes literally – to attract voters and attempt to stay in office. If their party loses, the opposition is left to clean up the mess. Jeremy Hunt is expected to raid the public finances to conjure some pre-election goodies in his budget on 6 March. He will create the headroom for tax cuts mainly by tightening the squeeze already imposed on Whitehall departments. And whoever takes over after the election will find gaping funding holes, empty coffers, high debt and low growth. As legacies go, Hunt’s is on course to rank as one of the worst. Here we compare six earlier poison pill budgets. Derick Heathcoat-Amory, 1958 The 1950s were characterised by tax-cutting administrations, but the Conservatives’ budget before the 1959 general election was an extreme example – bursting with baubles including cuts to income tax, purchase tax (a forerunner of VAT) and beer duty, and a surprise halving of a tax on cinema tickets. Christopher Hood, professor of public administration at Oxford University, picks out this irresponsible budget as one of the worst examples of pre-election bribery. He says the chancellor made the giveaways seem possible by using forecasts for bumper tax receipts and restrained public spending that many described as a fraud. It won the Tories the 1959 election. But Heathcoat-Amory’s successor, Selwyn Lloyd, “had the job of putting up taxes almost immediately”, according to Hood, whose recent book The Way the Money Goes shows that pre-election blowout budgets “can do a lot of political damage to incumbents if they turn out to be re-elected and have to live with the consequences of their budgetary largesse”.Poison rating ★★★★★Bribery ★★★★★ Reginald Maudling, 1964 Maudling spent much of his time as Tory chancellor pumping up the economy with tax cuts and higher public spending. Jason Lennard, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, said: “The backdrop to his pre-election budget was of an already overheating economy with demand outstripping supply, pushing inflation higher. But while Maudling talked about a sustainable expansion, his economic reforms were minimal and the wheels inevitably came off.” In his 1964 budget, Maudling increased indirect taxes to try to engineer a soft landing. He also refrained from further income tax cuts, with the basic rate stuck at 38.75%. Conservative voters deserted him and in October that year, Labour scored a narrow victory. Maudling wrote to his Labour successor, James Callaghan: “Good luck, old cock … Sorry to leave it in such a mess.”Poison rating ★★★★★Bribery ★★☆☆☆ Tony Barber, 1973 In 1973, Tory chancellor Barber followed in Maudling’s footsteps. A dash for growth was his answer to the rise in unemployment that took hold a year after Ted Heath’s government gained power in 1970. Barber let rip in 1972. A year later, he was more circumspect, and introduced a 10p VAT rate, which had been one of the conditions of Britain’s entry earlier that year into the European Economic Community. Conservative voters again punished their leaders for raising taxes and the February 1974 election resulted in a hung parliament. In the midst of an energy and fuel crisis sparked by the oil price quadrupling, Labour narrowly took control after a second election, in October. Barber’s boom had triggered a surge in inflation and a wave of strikes that battered the incoming Labour government and eventually forced chancellor Denis Healey to seek a bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund.Poison rating ★★★★★Bribery ★★☆☆☆ Norman Lamont, 1992 It’s the history lesson that still gives Labour nightmares. Tory chancellor Lamont’s budget was full of giveaways to bolster his party’s chances of winning after a long recession – an event that should have brought the curtain down on 13 years of Tory government. Lamont offered cuts in income tax, car sales tax and betting duty. Labour leader Neil Kinnock dismissed it as “a panic-stricken pre-election sweetener”, but Labour’s opposition to the introduction of a lower rate of income tax is widely seen as having been fatal, casting it as the high-tax party. The Tories won, Kinnock resigned, and Lamont was left to digest his own poison. A year later, the chancellor had to claw back much of his previous generosity after it became clear it was unaffordable.Poison rating ★★★★★Bribery ★★★★★ Ken Clarke, 1996 There is a commonly held view that Tory chancellor Clarke bequeathed Tony Blair’s government a golden inheritance. And it is true that government finances were in reasonable shape when New Labour took power. However, a succession of austerity budgets had helped Clarke offer modest tax cuts ahead of the 1997 election. A further pledge to maintain low levels of public spending for at least another two years gave Clarke financial headroom to raise the inheritance tax threshold. Gordon Brown felt obliged to stick to Clarke’s tough spending targets even though booming domestic and global economies meant plentiful cash flowing into the Treasury’s coffers. Years of frozen Whitehall budgets under Clarke stretched to the end of the century under Brown, with a much-needed overhaul of public services and welfare delayed until later in Labour’s first term.Poison rating ★★★☆☆Bribery ★★☆☆☆ Alistair Darling, 2010 Labour had been caught in the financial firestorm that erupted in the US housing market and fanned out across the world during 2008. Darling, as chancellor, had to spend at wartime levels to bail out those caught in the crossfire, primarily UK banks. By 2010, he and prime minister Gordon Brown were under pressure to keep a tight rein on the public finances. Ahead of the election, Brown wanted an upbeat budget to beat David Cameron’s refashioned Tory party, but Darling persuaded him that financial markets remained febrile and any sign of extra borrowing would trigger a rise in the cost of debt financing, and risk seeing the UK pushed to the brink of quitting the EU, as Greece had been.  To balance his budget, Darling took a scythe to public investment – cuts his successor, George Osborne, largely kept in place, leaving the UK to rue a decade characterised by low productivity and low growth. Labour suffered at the polls, and was punished again when a lighthearted note left by then chief secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne came to light. Echoing Maudling’s mea culpa, Byrne wrote to his successor: “I’m afraid there is no money.” It was treated as a confession by Osborne and has been used as a stick to beat Labour ever since.Poison rating ★★☆☆☆Bribery ★☆☆☆☆ • This article was amended on 2 March 2024 to remove a reference to the UK’s withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism, which occurred in September 1992, not – as an earlier version implied – before Norman Lamont’s budget of that year."

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index has slipped to 76.9 for February, down from January’s reading of 79.0, and also worse than the preliminary reading of 79.6 taken duting last month. The Current Economic Conditions index fell by 3.1%, to 79.4 from 81.9. The Index of Consumer Expectations lost 2.5%, to 75.2 from 77.1.  *US FEB.

For all but one index component, readings this month were higher than all values between mid-2021 and the end of 2023. Consumers perceived few changes in the state of the economy since the start of the new year, and they appear to be assured that inflation will continue on a favorable trajectory.

The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said there were shortfalls in arrangements for storing alkali metals at Nuclear Restoration Services’ (NRS) Dounreay site on the coast of northern Scotland. The ONR said:  “Buildings used to store alkali metals, predominantly sodium, were leaking in rainwater - with pools observed where containers of these metals were being kept.”   The regulator’s inspectors found that a prolonged period of exposure to moist and damp conditions had resulted in “degradation of the barriers for safe storage of these chemicals” at the Caithness site. No one was harmed and there was “no radiological consequences” but there “was the potential for serious personal injury, if workers had been exposed to these hazardous materials”, the ONR said. “The storage arrangements for these materials were inadequate and fell below legal compliance and the high standards that we expect to see,” said Ian Phillips, ONR’s head of safety regulation for decommissioning, fuel and waste sites. The ONR will monitor the response to the notice at Dounreay, which is run by NRS, formerly known as Magnox. Dounreay was the UK’s centre for fast reactor research and development from 1955 until 1994. The decommissioning of nuclear sites in Britain was put in the spotlight late last year when the Guardian published Nuclear Leaks, a year-long investigation into cybersecurity, safety and allegations of a “toxic” culture at Sellafield, the vast nuclear waste site in Cumbria.

The money markets currently anticipate that the Bank of England’s first rate cut may not come until August – until recently it was seen in June, but that is now less likely. Three quarter-point rate cuts this year are no longer fully priced in; at the end of last year, as many as six were expected in 2024.     2.23pm GMT  Why Pill voted to leave rates on hold last month  In his speech in Cardiff, Huw Pill says there were three reasons he voted to leave interest rates on hold at 5.25% last month:  First, while economic activity remains weak in the UK – with real GDP contracting in the second half of last year according to the latest vintage of data – I attribute a significant part of this weakness to developments on the supply side.  Second, I expect to see headline consumer price inflation continue to fall in the coming months, and likely to approach or even fall below the 2% inflation target this spring. Of itself, that is good news. But the drivers of this decline in annual headline inflation are a combination of base and external effects. We need to guard against being lulled into a false sense of security about inflation developments over the medium term by the mechanical effects of high monthly inflation a year ago dropping out of the calculation of annual rates and / or the impact of downside surprises in international commodity prices, notably for energy and food.  Third – and reflecting this last point – in coming to a view on monetary policy, my focus remains on the persistent component of consumer price inflation. It is this persistent component that will still be there at the 12-to-24-month horizon when monetary policy decisions taken today have their greatest impact on inflation.      2.07pm GMT  BoE's Huw Pill: Time for first rate cut is 'some way off'  Newsflash: The Bank of England’s chief economist says he believes the central bank is “some way off” cutting interest rates. In a speech at Cardiff University Business School now, Huw Pill explains that he needs to see “more compelling evidence” that the underlying persistent component of UK CPI inflation is being squeezed down, so that inflation will sustainably hit its 2% inflation target. Pill was one of six policymakers who voted to leave interest rates on hold last month at 5.25% (two wanted to raise to 5.5%, and the ninth wanted a cut to 5%). Pill explains today that he believes the signs of a downward shift in the persistent component of inflation dynamics are early, and “tentative”. He says:  In my view, we have some way to go before such evidence becomes conclusive. While that persistent component of inflation continues to threaten the lasting and sustainable achievement of the 2% inflation target, the MPC will need to maintain a degree of restrictiveness in its monetary policy stance to squeeze this persistent component out of the system.  Pill points out that monetary policy could still be restrictive, even if Bank Rate was cut from its current 16 year highs. He adds:  Nonetheless, in my baseline scenario the time for cutting Bank Rate remains some way off. I need to see more compelling evidence that the underlying persistent component of UK CPI inflation is being squeezed down to rates consistent with a lasting and sustainable achievement of the 2% inflation target before voting to lower Bank Rate.      1.34pm GMT   UK stamp prices are going up again. Royal Mail says the price of first-class stamps will increase by 10p to £1.35 and second-class stamps will increase by 10p to 85p. A year ago, a first-class stamp cost 95p before being hiked to £1.10 in April 2023, before another 15p increase in October last year. The increase comes after warnings by the loss-making firm over the impact of higher costs and lower demand for letters. Royal Mail says it needs to raise stamp prices due to the drop in letter volumes. In January, regulator Ofcom suggested Royal Mail’s service obligation could be reduced to just three deliveries a week, saying it £650m a year.   Related: Royal Mail could save £650m by moving to three-day-a-week service, says Ofcom        1.11pm GMT   Back in the economic sphere, Brazil’s economy ended last year in stagnation. New data shows Brazil’s GDP was unchanged in the final quarter of 2023, weaker than the 0.1% growth expected by economists.  The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Brazil stagnated 0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 over the previous quarter.https://t.co/Kmncqw44j7 pic.twitter.com/LP4XzyrCvM— TRADING ECONOMICS (@tEconomics) March 1, 2024  On an annual basis, Brazil grew by 2.9% last year. Reuters has more details:  Activity in the country got a boost from agriculture in early 2023, with booming exports of commodities like soybeans, while a resilient job market and the positive impact of welfare programs on consumption helped it for most of the year. Economists expect that to change in 2024 as Brazil faces a drop in agricultural output and borrowing costs remain high, with the central bank’s benchmark interest rate now at 11.25% even after a total 250 basis points of cuts since August.      12.40pm GMT   Property developers will welcome the high court’s ruling, says Vicky Fowler, head of planning at the law firm Gowling WLG.   “This long-awaited and landmark decision in relation to planning policy is likely to reverberate throughout the commercial real estate sector as it breathes a sigh of relief. Developers should take comfort in the ruling and the fact that the NPPF does not (at least at the moment) come anywhere close to creating a presumption for the reuse of buildings.”  [NPPF = National Planning Policy Framework, which lays out the government’s planning policies for England]     12.25pm GMT  Full story: M&S wins legal challenge over Gove’s block on Oxford Street store revamp  Marks & Spencer has claimed victory after Michael Gove’s decision to block a controversial plan to raze and redevelop its main store on London’s Oxford Street was ruled to be unlawful. The levelling up secretary refused permission to redevelop the store near Marble Arch in the West End in July last year, in a win for campaigners concerned about the carbon footprint of the plan. In August M&S mounted a legal challenge to that decision and on Friday morning a high court judgment revealed the judge had sided with the retailer. The M&S operations director, Sacha Berendji, said the “judgment couldn’t be clearer”.  Berendji added:  “The court has agreed with our arguments on five out of the six counts we brought forward and ruled that the secretary of state’s decision to block the redevelopment of our Marble Arch store was unlawful.”  More here.   Related: M&S wins legal challenge over Gove’s block on Oxford Street store revamp       12.10pm GMT  Why the high court ruled aginst the government  Today’s ruling that the government’s decision to block Marks & Spencer from rebuilding its flagship store in Marble Arch in central London was unlawful is online here. It shows that M&S brought its case against the blocking of its demolition plan on six counts.  Ground One – the SoS erred in respect of paragraph 152 of the National Planning Policy Framework (“NPPF”) when he said in DL 24 that there is a “strong presumption in favour of repurposing and reusing buildings”; Ground Two – the SoS erred in respect of the consideration of alternatives; Ground Three – the SoS erred in the balance of public benefits as against the heritage impacts; Ground Four – the SoS’s conclusion on the harm to the vitality and viability of Oxford Street, had no evidential basis; Ground Five – the SoS made an error of fact in respect of the embodied carbon, and misapplied policy in respect of embodied carbon; Ground Six – the SoS erred in his approach to analysing the impact of the proposals on the setting of Selfridges and the Stratford Place CA  Judge Nathalie Lieven ruled in favour of M&S on grounds one to four. On ground 5, she says Gove “appears to have become thoroughly confused” about the rules for carbon offsetting, and thought they applied to embodied carbon rather than just to operational carbon. Judge Lieven says that if the secretary of state had properly understood the policy he might have come to a different conclusion; but in any event, she is quashing the decision on the first four Grounds. On the sixth point, related to heritage issues, she dismissed M&S’s argument.     12.09pm GMT   A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson has commented on the court ruling, saying:  “We acknowledge the judgement and are considering our next steps. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.”      11.35am GMT   Today’s high court ruling on the M&S Marble Arch store will embarrass the government, argues James Souter, partner at Charles Russell Speechlys. But, he adds, it doesn’t automatically mean M&S will now get permission to demolish the store….  This case goes to the heart of an uneasy tension between the protection of heritage assets, environmental concerns and developmental potential. Today’s decision will be embarrassing for the Government, not least because of the public perception on the costs incurred. It could also give developers greater confidence in bringing forwards contemporary new-build schemes, even where the possibility of retrofitting existing structures is theoretically possible. However, this does not automatically mean that planning permission will be granted – Gove will have to redetermine the appeal and could in theory still refuse planning permission.   Updated at 11.35am GMT    11.25am GMT   Dee Corsi, chief executive at New West End Company, says M&S’s “successful appeal” against Michael Gove’s decision will provide clarity to developers who are redeveloping UK city centres:  “Today’s decision is a just result for Marks & Spencer, whose proposed development is a key part of Oxford Street’s and the West End’s future growth story. We are hopeful the successful appeal will now lead to enhanced clarity in the planning system for all developers to benefit from, whether they are pursuing a retrofit or a redevelopment. We like, Marks & Spencer, are in full support of a planning system which prioritises sustainable retrofits, where they are both commercially viable and have a clear environmental pay-off over the long-term.“This added clarity can only be positive for our city centres – from flagship retail and leisure destinations, like Oxford Street, to local high streets – and would drive growth and investment within the U.K.’s property sector.“The landmark decision to move forward on Marks & Spencer’s flagship redevelopment plans sends a positive signal to other investors that Oxford Street and the West End is a world-leading destination to do business.”      11.20am GMT  M&S: High Court rules Secretary of State’s planning decision on Marble Arch store unlawful  Marks & Spencer has announced a breakthrough in its legal battle to demolish and rebuild its main store on Oxford Street in the West End of London. The UK retailer says the high court has ruled that Michael Gove’s decision to block the redevelopment of its Marble Arch store was unlawful. M&S brought a legal challenge against Gove, which was heard in the high court last month. M&S operations director Sacha Berendji, says the court agreed with five of M&S’s six arguments against the secretary of state for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.  The company brough the case after Gove disagreed with the recommendation from inspectors to approve the plans and refused permission.   Related: Marks & Spencer refused permission to demolish and rebuild Oxford Street store   Gove had refused permission for the demolition partly because it would “fail to support the transition to a low carbon future”, and would not encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings. Today, Berendji says:  Today’s judgment couldn’t be clearer, the Court has agreed with our arguments on five out of the six counts we brought forward and ruled that the Secretary of State’s decision to block the redevelopment of our Marble Arch store was unlawful. The result has been a long, unnecessary and costly delay to the only retail-led regeneration on Oxford Street which would deliver one of London’s greenest buildings, create thousands of new jobs and rejuvenate the capital’s premier shopping district.

Annual consumer price inflation in the euro area dipped to 2.6% in February, new data from Eurostat shows, down from 2.8% in January. That takes eurozone inflation closer to the official target of 2%, but was higher than the 2.5% which economists expected.

Services inflation was little changed, at 3.9%, compared with 4.0% in January, while inflation in industrial goods slipped to 1.6%, from 2.0% in January. But energy prices provided less of a deflationary effect – they were -3.7% lower year-on-year, compared with a 6.1% fall in January.

Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says:  A 0.6% gain for the month of February alone does dent hopes of a sharp decline back down to target in the coming months, feeding off the back of yesterday’s concerning 0.8% reading out of France. With both headline and core inflation coming in above estimates, traders will be keeping a close eye out for any change in stance from the ECB at Thursday’s monetary policy announcement. While today’s data looks unlikely to lessen the chance of a June rate cut, it does dampen any calls for a speedy return to easing in April.   Updated at 10.35am GMT    10.13am GMT  UK manufacturing PMI: what the experts say  Despite the rise in this month’s UK Manufacturing PMI [from 47 to 47.5] the sector continues to contract, points out Michael McGowan, managing director of foreign exchange at Bibby Financial Services:  It’s clear that the pressure to tread carefully is bearing down on manufacturers as they look for ways to turn a profit. “And geopolitical volatility isn’t making matters any easier. Whilst many may have hoped to see de-escalation in the Red Sea by now, the crisis drags on. For SME manufacturers in particular, events in the Middle East have only compounded the complex set of issues facing them at home - from inflation to high interest rates to the continued impact of Brexit on overseas trading.  Cara Haffey, manufacturing and automotive lead at PwC UK, says:  “Despite rising to a 10 month high of 47.5 in February, the UK Manufacturing PMI is still contracting and shows the ongoing disruption to global trade caused by events in the Red Sea and Suez Canal.  Manufacturers are continuing to do their best to circumvent these issues, as vendors and suppliers test the agility of their supply chains by sourcing alternate routes. However, rerouting supplies, such as around Southern Africa, as well as sourcing more local suppliers both carry added cost implications - which will not be welcome news for the sector.   Manufacturers continue to limp along after a full year of decline, says Fhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK, with the cost of living squeeze also hurting.   Manufacturers are now finding it is becoming increasingly more challenging to refill their orders pipeline, without which they will risk further cost cutting measures such as reducing headcount and investment to preserve their long-term viability. It also reflects consumers shying away from spending with the higher cost of borrowing which rewards the cautious spender saving for a rainy day. The impact of this behavioural change, coupled with an increasingly stressed logistics sector due to ongoing tensions in the Red Sea has limited the access of materials and components and set the scene for a difficult year ahead for industry. Manufacturers will now need to be wary of potentially deteriorating economic conditions and act accordingly to shield against any further shocks.”      9.51am GMT   Worryingly, the employment index part of the UK manufacturing PMI has sunk to its lowest level since June 2020.  Factory bosses reported that lower employment reflected restructuring, redundancies and cost management programmes. Excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, it was the worst reading since June 2009 (when the UK had fallen into recession after the financial crisis).     9.41am GMT  UK manufacturing downturn continues amid weak demand and Red Sea crisis  UK factories experienced supply chain disruption due to the Red Sea crisis last month, as activity fell again, a survey this morning shows. UK manufacturing production fell for the twelfth month running in February, according to S&P Global’s monthly poll of UK purchasing managers. New orders, output, employment levels and stocks of purchases all fell last month, as firms cut staff and also struggled with rising costs. Some sought out alternative suppliers from more expensive markets closer to home, due to shipping firms avoiding the Suez Canal and taking the longer route around southern Africa.   Related: More than 100 container ships rerouted from Suez canal to avoid Houthi attacks   Demand also remained weak, with new order intakes falling at the fastest rate since last October. Overall, the S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the sector, rose to 47.5 in March, up from 47.0 in February. That’s better than the flash estimate of 47.1 recorded during last month, but still shows the 19th consecutive monthly drop in activity in the sector. Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, says  “UK manufacturers faced challenging circumstances in February, as the ongoing impact of the Red Sea crisis delayed raw material deliveries, inflated purchase prices and impacted production capabilities. There were also knock-on effects for demand, as new export orders were hit by both supply disruptions and higher shipping costs. Production volumes subsequently contracted for the twelfth successive month while total new orders fell at the sharpest rate since October.  This dipruption also pushed up prices, Dobson points out, and caused delays:  Input cost inflation hit an 11-month high, leading to a further increase in selling prices. Average supplier lead times meanwhile lengthened to the greatest extent since mid-2022. Several manufacturers noted that they faced the difficult choice between accepting delays from re-routed shipping or facing the prospect of paying higher prices to source from closer to home. This comes at a time of already heightened cost caution at manufacturers in response to weak demand, as highlighted by further cuts to employment, purchasing and inventories in February.  Any upward pressure on inflation will be a concern to policymakers, and may add to calls that it is too early to be confident on the timing of interest rate cuts, Dobson adds.  Updated at 9.50am GMT    9.30am GMT  Eurozone factory recession continues  Euro zone manufacturing activity has contracted for the 20th month running,  The latest survey of purchasing managers at European factories shows that output fell again last month. New orders and purchasing activity also contracted, but at the slowest rate since March 2023, according to data provider S&P Global. This pulled the HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing PMI down to 46.5, from January’s 46.6, showing a faster contraction (50 = stagnation).  Looking into Eurozone Manufacturing PMI the report confirms that Union is in line with a subpar but still positive growth with recovery phase in place for large part of countries.Expansion remains weak and subject to one-off, but Q3 weakness seems now well behind us... pic.twitter.com/CfiVSzhDXr— Mario Cavaggioni (@CavaggioniMario) March 1, 2024  Dr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says:  “The eurozone’s one-year industrial recession is not coming to an end. Output has declined again at the same pace as the previous month, mainly due to the heavyweights Germany and France. Spain, by contrast, is the first of the leading four euro countries to re-enter growth territory. On a slightly more positive note, the decline in new orders in the Eurozone has softened somewhat, offering a glimmer of hope for a potential demand recovery in the future.”  The survey also shows that Middle East tensions caused some delays to Europe’s manufacturing sector, de la Rubia adds:   “The attacks by the Houthis on commercial vessels in the Red Sea have had a temporary impact, leading to a brief lengthening of delivery times in January, followed by a subsequent reduction in lead times in February. Consequently, the softer decline in input prices this month is unlikely to be wholly attributed to tensions in the Red Sea but rather to movements in commodity prices, such as the recent rise in oil prices. The fundamental trend of lower demand, which remains the primary driver of faster delivery times, continues to persist      9.11am GMT  Key event  In the crypto market, bitcoin has posted its strongest monthly performance in over three years. Bitcoin gained almost 45% in February, helped by strong inflows into the new bitcoin ETFs (exchange traded funds) launched by major asset managers to track the world’s largest crypto asset. That lifted bitcoin’s price by almost $19,000 last month – its biggest gain in dollar terms ever – from $42,447 on 1 February to $61,445 at last night’s close. But, bitcoin ended February with something of a wobble – having hit almost $64,000 earlier in the week. Jason Hollands, managing director at UK financial planning and investment management firm Evelyn Partners, says:  “Bitcoin’s resurgence looks like it’s being driven by its adoption into mainstream investment products in the US. In January, US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission authorised the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading soon afterwards. A plethora of funds have been launched, including ETFs from major players like BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco.  “The key point is that these spot Bitcoin ETFs – unlike futures or derivates-based instruments that existed previously - actually hold the digital currency, so as they gain inflows they must buy more of it and that is likely to increase the underlying price of Bitcoin. Not least because there is a well-documented limited supply, thanks in part to the ‘halving’ process.  The next halving event occurs in April, and will lower the supply of new coins.     8.57am GMT  Pearson eyes AI gains after profits rise  Pearson, the London-listed digital learning group, has announced a further £200m share buyback and said it was well positioned to benefit from opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) as it reported a 31% rise in full year adjusted operating profit of £573m in 2023, from £456m in 2022. Pearson’s shares have jumped 4.4% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. The company in recent years has transformed itself from a traditional textbook education group to focus more on digital and workplace training. Omar Abbosh, a former Accenture executive and ex-president of industry solutions at Microsoft, who took over as chief executive of Pearson earlier this year from Andy Bird, said on a media call on Friday that Pearson had expanded generative AI study tools to help students and was well placed for future growth. Abbosh said:  “The secret sauce for AI is data. In Pearson we have a vast array of data sets which will make us a winner in AI.”   …adding that the world was at an “inflexion point” with AI as more companies looked to train staff for jobs augmented by the new technology. The company, which generates most of its earnings in the US, came under pressure last year from Cevian Capital, its largest shareholder, to move its listing from London to the US. The proposal comes at a time when London is fighting to keep listed companies after companies such as CRH, the building materials group, and Ferguson, the UK-based plumbing equipment supplier, decided to shift their primary listings from London to New York. Abbosh was asked about the London listing and replied that his focus remained on shareholder value and organic growth. He said he would”listen very carefully to ideas” and “ would look at the pros and cons..” but had yet to begin his first investor roadshow.     8.39am GMT  Wincanton backs GXO's £762m offer in takeover battle  The takeover battle over UK haulage firm Wincanton has taken another twist this morning. Wincanton’s board have thrown their support behind a £762m takeover offer from the American logistics company GXO and dropped their backing for a rival bid. The Wincanton directors intend to recommend unanimously an offer of 605p for each Wincanton share made by GXO yesterday. They have withdrawn their backing for an “increased and final cash offer” from Marseille-based CEVA Logistics at 480p a share, announced earlier this week. The GXO offer is pitched at a 29% premium to the all-time high share price of 470p reached during the period to 18 January, the last business day before Wincanton received a £567m bid from CEVA. The Wincanton share price dipped 0.46% to 621.15p in early trading on Friday, but has risen sharply since 18 January, when it traded at 297p. Although it billed its £600m offer as “final”, CEVA could come back with a higher offer. It has four business days from Thursday in which to table an improved bid…     8.24am GMT  ITV shares surge after Britbox sale stake  In the City, shares in broadcaster ITV have surged 14% after it announced the sale of its stake in the BritBox streaming service. BBC Studios, ITV’s joint partner in the venture, is buying the 50% stake for £255m. ITV says it is focusing on its advertiser-funded streaming service, ITVX; it plans to return the cash from the sale of its Britbox stake to investors through a share buyback. Carolyn McCall, ITV’s CEO says:  “The sale of 50% of BritBox International means ITV is focused on its core strategic goals of continuing to build on ITVX’s success and growing ITV Studios.  I would like to thank the BritBox International team for making the company such a success and particularly CEO Reemah Sakaan for her leadership, drive and vision.”  News of the sale has sent ITV’s shares surging to the top of the leaderboard on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized stocks. BritBox was launched by the BBC and ITV in 2019, as a rival to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Sky’s Now TV. It offers a range of classic UK shows, from Downton Abbey and Love Island to Grange Hill and Captain Pugwash.   Related: What is BritBox? Your questions answered       8.16am GMT  Rise in house prices in February suggests 'correction is over'  February’s pick-up in house prices bolsters the view that the correction in property values seen in late 2022 and part of last year has ended, says Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club forecasting group. Beck explains:  An improving economic outlook has helped. Falling inflation and still-strong pay growth mean real wages are rising again, unemployment is very low, consumer sentiment has picked up and quoted mortgage rates are up to 150 basis points lower than the peaks of summer 2023. “These factors contributed to mortgage approvals in January increasing to a 15-month high [the Bank of England reported yesterday], while surveys of buyer and seller activity have also picked up. Very high inward migration, along with a continued under-supply of new houses, are also supporting property values.      7.56am GMT   Karen Noye, mortgage expert at Quilter, points out that some lenders – including Nationwide – have recently been raising their mortgage rates. They’ve been tracking the increase in borrowing costs in the market, she explains:   “The latest Nationwide house price index shows the housing market continued its positive start to the year in February, with annual house price growth up 1.2%, the first sign of positive annual growth since January 2023, while on a monthly basis prices rose 0.7%.  “Lower mortgage rates at the start of the year appear to have spurred some buyers back to the market which has buoyed prices, but more recently we have seen a further uptick in rates as swap rates have risen so this could be relatively short lived. Just last week, lenders including Nationwide, NatWest, Santander and HSBC all made the decision to increase their rates.      7.44am GMT   Hopes that the UK property market has “turned a corner” are creating momentum and lifting prices, says Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders:  “It’s a bounceback, not a blip. Nationwide’s data shows house prices have risen in four out of the past five months, and the upward momentum is now so strong that prices have climbed 1.2% compared to this time last year. “Crucially the market has also become more free-flowing. For sale signs are starting to sprout from homes across the country, and estate agents report a steady uptick in interest from both buyers and sellers. “Two things are driving this resurgence in activity – mortgages have become more affordable and there’s a widespread sense that house prices have definitively turned a corner.      7.41am GMT   Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, predicts average house prices will rise by 3% this year, as interest rates are cut. Following this morning’s Nationwide house price data, Bill says:  “Buyers feel confident that the only way for the base rate is down, which has seen demand and house prices pick up in recent months. However, the upwards pressure on mortgage rates in recent weeks shows sellers the importance of getting the asking price right. Banks are keen to lend and should eventually lower rates this year as inflation comes under control, which we believe will sustain positive annual growth in 2024 and see UK house prices increase by 3%.”      7.30am GMT   Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, reports that the housing market is still ‘price sensitive’ – meaning over-priced houses will struggle to sell:  “In our offices, more valuations, listings and viewings combined with fewer fall-throughs than this time last year are feeding through to agreed sales, mortgage approvals and exchanges. “However, while Nationwide reports another rise in prices, the market does remain price sensitive. Only competitively-priced properties are attracting attention. Sellers must price realistically or offers won’t be forthcoming and market improvement may not be sustained.”      7.24am GMT   These charts from Nationwide show how annual house price inflation has pulled out of its slide last year, leaving prices 3% below the all-time highs:     7.18am GMT  Nationwide: Rising borrowing costs could threaten recover  A pick-up in borrowing costs could “restrain” the recovery in house prices, Nationwide adds. Chief economist Robert Gardner says:  “Borrowing costs remain well below the highs recorded last summer but, if the recent upward trend is sustained, it threatens to restrain the pace of any housing market recovery. “While the squeeze on household budgets is easing, with wage growth now outstripping inflation by a healthy margin, it will take time to make up for the ground lost over the past few years, especially given consumer confidence remains fragile.”  The money markets have dialled back their expectations of interest rate cuts this year, which is why borrowing costs have been inching higher. At the end of 2023, the City expected as many as six interest rate cuts in 2024, bringing Bank of England base rate down to 3.75%, from 5.25%. Now, though, fewer than three quarter-point rate cuts are expected.     7.15am GMT  Introduction: Annual house prices rise for first time in over a year in February  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK house prices have continued to recover from their slide last year, with prices rising on an annual basis for the first time in over a year last month. Lender Nationwide has reported that UK house prices were 1.2% higher than a year ago in February, having jumped by 0.7% during the month – the same monthly rise as in January. This lifted the average price to £260,420, up from £257,656 in January, Nationwide reports. Nationwides’s data is based on mortgages approved by the lender, and doesn’t capture cash buyers. It does suggest that the drop in mortgage rates following the surge last year is helping to bring buyers back to the market. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says:  “The decline in borrowing costs around the turn of the year appears to have prompted an uptick in the housing market. Indeed, industry data sources point to a noticeable increase in mortgage applications at the start of the year, while surveyors also reported a rise in new buyer enquiries.  Gardner adds that “the near-term prospects remain highly uncertain”, partly due to ongoing uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. He says:  After falling sharply in late December, swap rates, which underpin fixed rate mortgage pricing, have drifted back up.  Nationwide reports that house prices are now around 3% below the all-time highs recorded in the summer of 2022, once seasonal effects are taking into account. February’s rise in prices follows a 0.7% rise during January, according to Nationwide’s data, which left prices 0.2% lower than a year ago. Yesterday, Bank of England data showed that new mortgage approvals rose in January to their highest level since October 2022, although new lending was still subdued in historic terms:  There were 55,227 UK mortgage approvals in January 2024 according to the Bank of England. This is 7.2% higher than in December 2023 & 40.2% higher than the nadir in December 2022 (after the first spike in mortgage rates due to the Mini Budget)... #ukhousing pic.twitter.com/ggEgFsr49m— Noble Francis (@NobleFrancis) February 29, 2024  Zoopla has reported this week that activity in the housing market has picked up; they forecast sales will rise 10% this year.

        "content": "Marks & Spencer has claimed victory after Michael Gove’s decision to block a controversial plan to raze and redevelop its main store on London’s Oxford Street was ruled to be unlawful. The levelling up secretary refused permission to redevelop the site near Marble Arch in the West End in July last year, in a win for campaigners concerned about the carbon footprint of the plan. In August, M&S mounted a legal challenge to that decision and in a high court ruling on Friday morning the judge sided with the retailer.   Related: M&S claims high court victory in battle to demolish Marble Arch store – business live   The M&S operations director, Sacha Berendji, said the “judgment couldn’t be clearer”. “The court has agreed with our arguments on five out of the six counts we brought forward and ruled that the secretary of state’s decision to block the redevelopment of our Marble Arch store was unlawful,” he added. He said Gove’s intervention – which was contrary to the recommendation from inspectors to approve the plans – had caused a “long, unnecessary and costly delay to the only retail-led regeneration on Oxford Street which would deliver one of London’s greenest buildings, create thousands of new jobs and rejuvenate the capital’s premier shopping district”. Berendji said the ball was back in Gove’s court and the minister now had the “power to unlock the wide-ranging benefits of this significant investment” and “send a clear message to UK and global business that the government supports sustainable growth and the regeneration of our towns and cities”. When Gove, who can appeal against the ruling, blocked the plan last year he said he had done so partly because it would “fail to support the transition to a low-carbon future, and would overall fail to encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings”. At the time, Berendji said Gove had “wrongly interpreted and applied planning policy to justify his rejection of our scheme on grounds of heritage and environmental concerns”. After a hearing last month, the high court judge Mrs Justice Lieven ruled that Gove had misapplied planning policy. She said he had also failed to give adequate reasons why blocking the plan would not cause wider harm to London’s West End, despite M&S having stated it would leave the site if it could not redevelop the store. She dismissed a sixth point related to heritage issues. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “We acknowledge the judgment and are considering our next steps..” Henrietta Billings, the director of the charity Save Britain’s Heritage, which campaigned against M&S’s plan, said the scheme still lacked planning consent six years after its launch, but might have achieved it if it had pursued a less environmentally damaging retrofit scheme. “This case has focused widespread public attention on the wasteful knock-it-down-and-build-again process that has dominated our construction sector for the last 100 years. We need a fresh positive approach to reusing historic buildings and saving precious resources. We also urgently need robust national planning policy on retrofit that aligns with the UK government’s law on net zero targets.”  The row over the fate of the store, one of two that M&S has on Oxford Street, has been a cause célèbre in recent years in the battle over the carbon footprint of redevelopment projects during the climate crisis and the fate of Britain’s struggling high streets. Gove ordered a public inquiry in June 2022 into the plan to demolish and rebuild the 1929 art deco building, with prize-winning architects, academics, heritage campaigners and the author Bill Bryson voicing opposition to the retailer’s plans, claiming the project would release 40,000 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. While the planning inspector recommended the project should go ahead, Gove chose to disagree with that decision. In recent years Oxford Street has lost its lustre because of the growing number of empty stores while troublesome candy and souvenir shops had moved in. However, recent figures suggest its fortunes have begun to improve, and the proportion of vacant shops is down by 40%. Dee Corsi, the chief executive of New West End Company, the trade body that represents businesses on Oxford Street, said it was a “just result” with the M&S overhaul likely to be a key part of the street’s future growth story."

        "content": "The annual pay package of the boss of GlaxoSmithKline, Emma Walmsley, has jumped by 50% to £12.7m, mainly because of a higher share bonus payout reflecting the British drugmaker’s improved performance. Walmsley’s huge pay rise makes her one of the highest-paid executives in the FTSE 100 index of leading shares, a week after it emerged that her counterpart at Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot, received a £16.9m pay package last year and is in line for an even higher package, £18.6m, this year. Walmsley is thought to be the highest-paid among the 10 female FTSE 100 chief executives. Her pay packet of £12.7m last year compares with £8.5m in 2022. Her fixed pay – comprised of salary, benefits and pension – dropped slightly to £1.6m, while her annual cash bonus increased to £3.8m from £3.1m, according to GSK’s annual report. Walmsley also received £7.3m from performance-based long-term share awards, compared with a £3.7m payout the year before, as a higher proportion of share awards vested last year and at a higher share price, increasing their value. The company said: “Emma Walmsley’s remuneration for 2023 reflected excellent and sustained delivery against stretching performance targets, aligned to shareholder interests and value creation. “This includes the company’s performance last year, where GSK delivered very strong sales, operating profit and earnings per share growth, and continued pipeline progress including the blockbuster launch of our new RSV vaccine, Arexvy.” GSK’s Arexvy jab was the first vaccine approved against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults, which causes thousands of deaths and hospitalisations in the UK each year, more than influenza. The RSV vaccine, launched in the summer, has already become a blockbuster (defined as a drug with at least $1bn annual sales), racking up £1.2bn sales in four months. In the first annual results since it spun off its consumer healthcare business Haleon in July 2022, GSK reported a pre-tax profit of £6.1bn for 2023, up by 14% at constant exchange rates. Turnover rose by 5% to £30.3bn, also boosted by steady demand for its shingles shot and HIV medicines. The company also upgraded its outlook.   Related: AstraZeneca boss’s £17m pay package under fire   Walmsley has been under pressure to improve GSK’s performance, with a series of attacks from the US activist investor Elliott Management, a New York-based hedge fund, three years ago. Andrew Speke, the spokesperson for the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said Walmsley’s and Soriot’s pay packages show that “the top executives of pharmaceutical companies can make vast fortunes on the UK’s stock exchange, all while the NHS struggles for sufficient funding”."

        "content": "The cost of first and second-class stamps is to go up again next month, after Royal Mail announced price rises of 10p a letter. The fourth increase in two years will take the price of a first-class stamp to £1.35 and the cost of the second-class service to 85p and will come into effect on 2 April. In March 2022, first-class stamps cost 85p and second-class stamps were 66p, but there has since been a run of increases, most recently in October. Royal Mail said it had “sought to keep price increases as low as possible in the face of increasing cost pressures and wage increases, declining letter volumes and lack of reform of the universal service obligation (USO)”. It said the number of letters sent had fallen from 20bn in 2004-05 to 7bn in 2022-23, while the number of addresses had risen by 4m. The average UK adult now spends less than £7 a year on stamped letters and receives on average just two letters a week, it said. The company, which was privatised in 2013, has been lobbying for changes to the USO, which requires it to deliver letters to the UK’s 32m addresses six days a week. The postal regulator, Ofcom, which is reviewing the rules, recently suggested Royal Mail could save up to £650m if it delivered letters three days a week, and £200m if it stopped Saturday deliveries. However, unions indicated they would not support a switch to a three-day-a-week model.   Related: Royal Mail could save £650m by moving to three-day-a-week service, says Ofcom    Nick Landon, the chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: “We always consider price changes very carefully, but we face a situation where letter volumes have reduced dramatically over recent years, while costs have increased. It is no longer sustainable to maintain a network built for 20bn letters when we are now only delivering 7bn. “As a result of letter volume decline, our posties now have to walk more than three times as far to deliver the same number of letters as before, increasing the delivery costs per letter.” He added: “It is vital that the universal service adapts to reflect changing customer preferences so that we can protect the one-price-goes-anywhere service, now and in the future.” Royal Mail said the new price of first- and second-class stamps remained below the average prices in Europe of £1.66 and £1.26 respectively."

        "content": "Some of largest and most profitable companies in the US are primed to save billions of dollars from a congressional tax deal that critics say gives “billions in tax credits to the biggest corporations while giving pennies to middle-class children and families”. And private equity funds could be among the deal’s biggest beneficiaries, a Guardian analysis suggests. The tax cuts passed the House of Representatives at the end of January as part of an agreement that pairs handouts for businesses with a moderate expansion of the child tax credit. The Senate could vote on the bill over the coming weeks, and the White House has indicated that Joe Biden would sign it into law.   Related: Trump gave top US firms staggering tax cuts, with some paying $0 or less – report   The deal, led by Democratic senator Ron Wyden and Republican congressman Jason Smith – the chairs of Congress’s tax-writing committees – would roll back a series of tax measures that were designed to partially offset the cost of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Weakening these provisions would allow companies to claim bigger tax deductions for certain expenses, including buying new equipment, spending money on research and development, and paying interest on their debt, as the Guardian previously reported. Last year the American Investment Council (AIC), private equity’s main trade group, spent more than $3m lobbying the federal government, according to OpenSecrets – more than any single year since 2009. Including their subsidiaries, five of the country’s largest private equity funds – Blackstone Group, KKR & Company, Carlyle Group, Cerberus Capital Management and Apollo Global Management – together spent an additional $21m lobbying over the same period. “Increasing the interest deductions, which private equity firms have been the worst abusers of, is just another example of how the Wyden-Smith tax deal hands out billions in tax credits to the biggest corporations while giving pennies to middle-class children and families,” the Democratic congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, one of two dozen House Democrats who voted against the bill, told the Guardian. “While private equity is cheering on the huge tax breaks they will get if this deal passes the Senate, American families are living paycheck to paycheck and struggling with rising costs.” ‘Debt can supercharge the returns of private equity’ Tax policy experts told the Guardian that raising the cap on interest deductibility could provide an especially generous subsidy for private equity funds, which rely heavily on debt.   Cheaper money, which has to be repaid by their takeover targets, is what makes private equity go  Carter Dougherty of Americans for Financial Reform    “The model of the private equity industry is often to … buy public corporations, take them private and load them up with debt,” said Steve Wamhoff of the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. These heavy debt burdens help explain why companies bought by private equity funds are about 10 times more likely than other firms to go bankrupt. “The deductions that are allowed for interest expenses really make that a more viable business model,” Wamhoff said. Debt is cheaper when companies get a tax break for deducting the interest they pay on that debt, and “cheaper money, which has to be repaid by their takeover targets, is what makes private equity go,” said Carter Dougherty of Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), an advocacy coalition. “The magic of the private equity business model, and the way that it’s able to generate outsized returns, is its reliance on debt for the acquisition,” said Brendan Ballou, author of Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America. If you invest $20m in a business and get 10% returns, you only get $2m back,” Ballou explained. “But if, of that $20m, you actually only put up $2m yourself, you actually make 100% return. So debt, or leverage, allows you to get bigger returns than you normally would if you actually had to put up your own cash.” That’s how “debt can supercharge the returns of private equity”, Ballou said. Asked for comment, the AIC referred the Guardian to two letters previously signed by the group, one of which states that “debt financing plays an important role in supporting job-creating investments”.   There’s nothing fair about private equity companies lining their pockets while shifting the tax burden to American families  Congressman Lloyd Doggett    “There’s already a strong bias in the tax code for debt, and this bill doubles down on that bias to boost private equity’s predatory practices, which will only drive more American companies into bankruptcy and decrease market competition,” said the Texas congressman Lloyd Doggett, one of three Democrats who voted against the bill in the House ways and means committee, in a statement. “There’s nothing fair about private equity companies lining their pockets while shifting the tax burden to American families already dealing with high costs.” ‘A complete wasteful giveaway’ The Trump tax law established new limitations on how much interest companies could deduct from their tax bills in a single year. That annual cap on interest deductions was tightened further in 2022. Higher interest rates have made debt more expensive, so private equity funds have found themselves having to invest more of their own money, rather than relying as extensively on borrowed money. That shift, in turn, has lowered potential returns, adding to the industry’s sense of urgency to loosen the cap on interest deductions, AFR’s Carter Dougherty said. Not only would the Wyden-Smith deal undo the tighter limit created by the Trump law, but it would do so retroactively, meaning corporations could amend their 2022 and 2023 tax returns to take advantage of the newly generous subsidies. Making these tax cuts retroactive “would be just a complete wasteful giveaway”, Chye-Ching Huang, the executive director of the Tax Law Center at the New York University School of Law, told the Senate finance committee last November. “You can’t change past investments or wages by giving away tax cuts.” Loosening the interest deduction threshold would cost $64bn over the next 10 years if it were made permanent, according to an estimate provided to members of the House ways and means committee by the US Congress’s non-partisan joint committee on taxation. While the Wyden-Smith deal only rolls back the provision through 2025, tax policy experts told the Guardian that corporations and their trade groups would probably work to extend it further. In a statement to the Guardian, a Wyden spokesperson said: “The provision dealing with business interest was a Republican priority in negotiations, and it’s clear that it would become law in a Republican Congress without any matching benefit for working families. With the support of finance committee Democrats, Senator Wyden set a standard for this divided Congress that any tax cuts for corporations must be matched with an investment in children and families that the Joint Committee on Taxation scores as equal, and that’s why the bill includes a child tax credit expansion that helps 16 million children from low-income families get ahead.” Smith’s office did not respond to a request for comment."

        "content": "ITV has sold its 50% stake in BritBox International, the streaming service that offers programmes such as Line of Duty outside the UK, to BBC Studios for £255m in cash. The UK broadcaster said the sale to its joint-venture partner would underpin its strategy of expanding its ITVX advertiser-funded streaming service and its global studios division. ITV said it planned to return the net sale proceeds, which total about £235m, to investors through a share buyback that it expects to launch shortly after it publishes full-year results next week. ITV shares rose almost 15% after the deal was announced on Friday morning.   Related: The TV licence fee scandal: why are 1,000 people a week being casually criminalised?   BritBox International offers scripted and live content and UK dramas such as Death in Paradise, Father Brown, Archie, Shetland and Sherwood to eight countries – the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The transaction will allow ITV Studios to receive an ongoing revenue stream from BritBox International similar to current levels for the use of TV content under new licensing agreements. BritBox International was jointly launched in 2017 by BBC Studios, the commercial arm of the BBC, and ITV, and has 3.75 million subscribers, up 300% over the past four years. Friday’s transaction does not affect BritBox UK, which continues to be fully owned by ITV and will still feature BBC content, ITV said. The ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said on Friday the sale “means ITV is focused on its core strategic goals of continuing to build on ITVX’s success and growing ITV Studios”. In the past year ITV has been buffeted by the downturn in advertising as the UK economy slowed. McCall said last July that ITV was in the midst of the worst advertising downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. The deal is significant for BBC Studios, the commercial arm of the BBC, which said in October 2022 that it aimed to double the size of its business between 2021-22 and 2027-28. BBC Studios had sales of £2.1bn in 2022-23. The BBC Studios chief executive, Tom Fussell, called the deal “an important acquisition” and said that taking full ownership would help its aims of doubling the size of its operations. After the move of BritBox International into BBC Studios, its global chief executive, Reemah Sakaan, will step down after three years in post, it was also announced on Friday."

        "content": "Bosses at the UK haulage company Wincanton have thrown their support behind a £762m takeover offer from the US logistics business GXO and dropped their backing for a rival bid. Wincanton said on Friday that directors intended to recommend unanimously an offer of 605p a share made by GXO on Thursday. In the latest twist in the takeover battle, the Wincanton board withdrew their backing for an “increased and final cash offer” from Marseille-based CEVA Logistics at 480p a share, announced earlier this week. The GXO offer is pitched at a 29% premium to the record high share price of 470p reached during the period to 18 January, the last business day before Wincanton received a £567m bid from CEVA.   Related: UK manufacturing hit by weak demand and Red Sea crisis; house prices return to growth – business live   Wincanton shares were trading at 622p on Friday, sharply above the 297p it was trading at on 18 January. Although it billed its £600m offer as “final”, CEVA could yet come back with a higher offer. It has four business days from Thursday in which to table an improved bid. Chippenham-based Wincanton, the last UK-listed logistics company, employs 20,000 people across the UK, shuttling goods around the country for customers such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. The Wincanton chair, Sir Martin Read, said: “Under the current management team, we have made positive progress and ensured that Wincanton is at the forefront of logistics innovation. The board of Wincanton is pleased that GXO recognises the very significant value inherent in this business and intends to recommend the offer to shareholders for their consideration.” The bidding battle comes as a string of other UK-listed companies face takeover bids. The electronics retailer Currys has rejected two bids from the US investment group Elliott Advisors, which owns Waterstones. After Elliott’s first bid, the Chinese online retailer JD.com also said it was considering making an offer for Currys. Also this week, the insurer Direct Line said it had rebuffed a “highly opportunistic” offer from its Belgian rival Ageas that valued it at £3.1bn. The head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, Susannah Streeter, said: “The swoop on UK targets by overseas companies is evidence that UK assets are considered to be cheap, still weighed down by the weaker pound, the struggling UK economy and to some extent, the lingering impact of Brexit. It’s understandable that worries have been swirling about the takeovers of London-listed companies given the number of big deals agreed in recent years. “The cheeky offers are likely to keep coming and although ultra-low offers will be rejected, boards and shareholders, who are dissatisfied by the low valuations which their companies have been languishing under, appear willing to accept improved offers, even if they are still priced relatively cheaply.” She added that the London market needed “a big dose of revitalisation” and the government could take measures in next week’s budget to help with this. “Halting planned cuts to dividend tax and capital gains tax thresholds would help support investors to make the most of their commitment to British firms. Cutting stamp duty on share purchases would also help ease the burden on investors. Increasing the Isa allowance would automatically increase investment in the UK because there is a major home bias among Isa investors.”"

        "content": "It is not every day that a judge quotes Winnie-the-Pooh. But this week, one made the return to the Hundred Acre Wood when delivering an extraordinary judgment over what constituted “raw honey”. Judge Neville was asked to settle a row between a high-end Greek food firm and a London council over whether the company could call their product “raw” or “artisan”. The dispute, between Waltham Forest trading standards and the firm Odysea, brought out the storyteller in Neville, who began by reciting the author AA Milne in his written decision. It read: “‘The things that make me different are the things that make me me’, said Piglet, who must have seen quite a bit of honey eaten over the years. If he treated Pooh to some ‘raw honey’, what would be different about it?” It’s not the first time that legal proceedings have made calls on the definitions of food although it is usually around matters of tax. Earlier this year, Walkers was ruled to have to pay VAT on its Mini Poppadoms because they are really more like crisps. Previous VAT debates have involved McVitie’s Jaffa Cakes, which tax authorities in the 1990s unsuccessfully argued were biscuits. Odysea, which has sold thousands of jars of honey proudly labelled as “raw”, argued that their honey was not heated above its natural temperature and underwent far less processing. However, Waltham Forest trading standards argued that all honey was raw because it has not been cooked, claiming the wording misled consumers by suggesting Odysea’s product was somehow different. The company had to reprint its labels to say “artisan honey” instead but in an appeal, the tribunal was called to adjudicate on that decision. In the end, the judge decided not to conclude over what defines the term itself, refusing to agree with the council that by calling the product “raw” it suggested special characteristics. He ruled in favour of Odysea on appeal. The judge concluded that the difficulty arose with the two parties asking the tribunal to rule between two different definitions of raw. He said: “The definition put forward by Waltham Forest, being ‘uncooked’, can be rejected. The average consumer would struggle to explain what ‘cooked honey’ might even look like.” But, he added, that rejection did not mean he was accepting Odysea’s definition. “The evidence shows that consumer perception is aligned with common sense: raw in this context takes the everyday meaning of ‘unwrought’, ‘unprocessed’, ‘in its natural state’. “But a precise definition that sorts honey into ‘raw’ and ‘not raw’ is less obvious … To avoid continuing to labour the point, I look at Odysea’s own honey. Its ‘limited run, single source’ honey described at paragraph 20 above would satisfy just about everyone as being raw honey, although even then the odd person might take exception to the centrifuge and the pump.” The judge concluded: “Ultimately, however, the tribunal’s task is not to be drawn into legislating a precise definition of ‘raw’, as both parties were apt to invite it to do, but to decide if this honey breaches the law in the way stated.” He rejected the idea that Odysea’s use of the word raw suggested special characteristics “that in fact all similar foods possess”, or was in any other way misleading. He added: “Doing the best I can, the word accurately conveys the lack of processing, including but not limited to heating, undergone by Odysea’s honey when compared with many others. I decline to reach any conclusion on where the lower limit of processing lies before honey may no longer be described as raw, and it may be that clearer guidance or regulation would assist consumers and producers.” Describing one of Odysea’s raw honey products, the panel at the Great Taste awards complimented the “subtle pine and fir flavours, the perfect level of sweetness, the hint of saltiness, the sheer sexiness of this honey”. The managing director of Odysea, Panos Manuelides, responding to the verdict, said: “We are delighted by the tribunal decision. Honey is not a very big business for us financially, our main business is olive oil and olives. “But it is an important part of our business and a fantastic product, produced in a village devastated by floods this year. It is a fantastic decision for them, and we have sold this honey for a long time and produced it with minimal processing … so we are delighted to be able to continue to sell it as it is, which is raw.” Waltham Forest council has been approached for comment."

The telecommunications giant issued the apology to people who were unable to make phone calls to triple zero for more than an hour on Friday morning. Telstra receives all triple zero calls before transferring them to local emergency services – but between 3.30am and 5am on Friday, Telstra was unable to immediately transfer 148 of 494 calls, the chief executive, Vicki Brady, told reporters.   Related: Optus outage inquiry to examine roaming and triple zero impacts but not cause of shutdown   One of those calls involved a person who suffered a cardiac arrest and died, Brady said. The Victorian Ambulance Union secretary, Danny Hill, described the incident as distressing for everyone involved. The patient died after an unsuccessful resuscitation effort, and the person who rang triple zero received a call back after the patient had died. “About an hour after … the crew had originally arrived and had been there working on the patient, they received a phone call saying do you still need an ambulance?” Hill told ABC radio. The 90-minute disruption was described by paramedics as “complete chaos”, with crews dispatched to cases with no details of the emergencies, Hill said. Telstra staff manually took down details from triple zero calls to send to emergency services by email, Brady said. “We followed our backup process exactly as they are designed but it is clear already from our preliminary review that there are improvements that we can make in these processes,” she said. The telco is investigating what caused its servers to not work as intended. “I … offer my deepest apology to the family of that person and in fact anyone who was impacted in those 90 minutes,” Brady said. “I haven’t yet had a chance and [it is] not appropriate yet to reach out to that family but clearly we don’t yet understand how much the delay was and how much that impacted,” she said. “But obviously it’s unacceptable if there was any delay in getting that call through.” The Australian Communications and Media Authority is undertaking an “initial assessment” of the situation, specifically looking at Telstra’s “compliance with regulatory obligations”, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said. “The Australian Communications and Media Authority is undertaking an initial assessment of Telstra’s compliance with its regulatory obligations,” Rowland said. “The government understands that one of the impacted callers to triple zero has passed away. We are deeply saddened and our thoughts are with their family and friends.”"

        "content": "Food industry trade bodies are discussing whether to take legal action against the government over post-Brexit plans that will require all meat and dairy products sold in the UK to be labelled as “not for EU”. Food producers say the labelling could add £250m a year to their costs, further fuelling inflation, and they are discussing a legal challenge as a viable option if a solution with the government is not found. One body said it was already consulting lawyers to examine its options if “sensible alternatives” to the plan were not put forward. As part of the Windsor framework agreed with the EU last year, since October 2023 all meat and dairy products sent from Britain to be sold in Northern Ireland have had to carry a “not for EU” label. The measure is designed to prevent goods from bypassing EU controls by being sent to the Republic of Ireland, which does not have a hard border with custom checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland.   Related: Brexit has cost UK food companies exporting to EU an extra £170m   But the labelling is set to be extended to all meat and dairy products sold in the UK from October, as part of the “safeguarding the union” deal with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) that was agreed in January. From July 2025, fruit and vegetables will also have to be labelled. The government has said the labels are needed “to ensure no incentive arises for businesses to avoid placing goods on the Northern Ireland market”, and that those in Northern Ireland have the same access to goods in the rest of the UK. Food producers, manufacturers and retailers have pushed back, saying a UK-wide approach will heap extra costs on to businesses and result in higher prices for consumers. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) has estimated the extra labelling could cost the industry up to £250m extra a year. Rod Addy, the director general of the Provision Trade Federation, said legal action was being discussed by several bodies as a viable option, if the government failed to engage.  “We are not launching a legal challenge yet but it is being discussed and considered as a serious possibility,” he said John Whitehead, the director of the Food and Drink Exporters Association, said a legal challenge had been discussed by trade bodies as a last resort, but they wanted to “work with, rather than fight the government”. A representative from a third trade body, which preferred not to be named, said: “We want to work with government to find sensible alternatives to the ‘not for EU’ labelling proposal, that meet government and DUP aims and work for business, and we think these exist. “However, as you would expect, we’re also taking professional advice, including legal advice, given the costs and other risks to our sector of the government’s proposals.” The main concerns from industry are around the upheaval to production the changes will create, with many having to run two separate production lines for products for the EU and UK. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which represents more than 1,000 manufacturers, has written to the Cabinet Office minister, Steve Baker, saying the labelling plans would hit exports and could lead to higher food prices. It also said the new regime would make investment in UK food and drink producers much less attractive, saying some overseas investors had already paused plans because of the changes. The government will close its consultation on labelling on 15 March, and is considering an exemption for small businesses. Nevertheless, producers have been critical of the process. Peter Hardwick, the trade policy adviser at the British Meat Processors Association, said: “That consultation has been published and states that: ‘The government is legislating to confirm that labelling requirements on agrifood products are applied across GB, to ensure no incentive arises for businesses to avoid placing goods on the NI market.’ “That doesn’t sound like a consultation to me. It is, in effect, a glorified impact assessment.” A government spokesperson said: “These measures will help ensure that consumers in Northern Ireland have access to the same goods as those in the rest of the United Kingdom, safeguarding the UK internal market and the operation of the Windsor Framework, and preventing the diversion of products. Businesses have already begun to apply Not for EU labelling in Great Britain. “We are currently carrying out a consultation seeking stakeholder views and evidence on how best to implement the GB labelling requirements as effectively as possible. This will consider exemptions or additional support, such as for small businesses.”"

        "content": "Get ready to see more flotations later this year, said David Schwimmer, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group on Thursday. Good: it would mark a change from the droughts of 2022 and 2023 that have caused much agonising over the health of the London stock market.  But, actually, the deep problem here may not be a shortage of newcomers. Rather, it could be indifference, or so it seems, towards sub-£1bn UK companies that have been around for years. The current extraordinary bid battle for Chippenham-based Wincanton, the last UK-listed logistics firm, shows how the London market – or part of it – sometimes doesn’t know how to value what it’s got. A bid at a 52% premium to the previous share price would normally be regarded as juicy if it came at the end of a contested tussle, but Wincanton got that on one day when a French shipping firm, CMA CGM, offered 450p-a-share, or £567m, last month. Some Wincanton shareholders felt the offer was still too mean (well done, Aberforth), so the French went to 480p to try to clinch things. But now comes a fresh suitor from the US, GXO Logistics, offering 605p. That is 104% more than the old share price of 297p, which shouldn’t happen if a market is liquid and full of active buyers and sellers. We’re not talking about a hard-to-value biotech outfit. Wincanton, with 20,000 employees, is in the business of warehouses and lorries. Yes, there have been a couple of complications in recent years – the loss of a contract with HMRC to check cross-border goods and a deficit in the pension fund (now resolved) – but neither should have scrambled the market’s collective brain.  Wincanton’s chairman, Sir Martin Read, understandably backed the original French offer on the grounds that the company’s strong financial performance had “not been reflected in the performance of its shares in recent years”. If Wincanton was an isolated case, one could shrug and say pockets of undervaluation can occur in any market. But, over at Currys, the electrical retailer, a similar tale is unfolding. From a previous 47p, the bids from US hedge fund Elliott have reached 67p per share, an improvement of 42%, and the defending board is still resisting – quite rightly, many of us would argue (Peel Hunt’s analyst reckons 80p is the point at which Currys would be obliged to engage). Currys’ largest shareholder, Redwheel, which has backed the board, made an excellent point when it said there was a wider problem with a UK equity market “which no longer seems to fulfil its primary purpose of price discovery and efficient capital allocation”. Fund manager Ian Lance pointed to the silliness of some big UK investment houses allocating cash away from UK equities, which are close to all-time low valuations, and towards US equities at close to all-time highs. “Unless this changes, it seems likely that we will continue to see overseas corporate buyers step in to take advantage of the depressed valuations of UK equities with ownership falling into foreign hands and the number of quoted UK businesses will continue to decline,” he argued.  It’s hard to disagree. A pitch for London is not compelling if it involves paying your advisers a small fortune to get listed and then being ignored for years until a foreign predator turns up. In a rational world, perceived undervaluations would bring forth buyers and the problem would solve itself. Maybe the sight of a 100% takeover premium will help at the margin.  But investor indifference towards pockets of small- and medium-sized companies is not new and none of the proposed remedies sounds transformational. Obliging UK pension funds to show more home bias in their equity portfolios would help, but compulsion has its limits.  The proposal for a “British ISA”, with allocations only to UK-listed stocks, probably wouldn’t shift serious sums. Consolidation among defined-benefit schemes, to produce bigger funds with an appetite to own more UK equities, will not happen overnight. If Schwimmer has more radical ideas, we’d love to hear them. Sadly, he seems more interested in arguing that people such as himself – those running large FTSE 100 companies – should be paid more to compete with US rivals. That won’t cure the problems at the other end of the market."

        "content": "The Bank of England’s interest-rate-setting committee is set to become majority female for the first time, after the appointment of a former key adviser to David Cameron and George Osborne as one of its deputy governors. Clare Lombardelli, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will sit on the nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) when she joins as the Bank’s next deputy governor for monetary policy. The former Treasury official will start her five-year term at the Bank on 1 July, succeeding Ben Broadbent, after King Charles approved the appointment. The MPC – created in 1997 after the central bank was given independence by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, and led by the governor, Andrew Bailey – will comprise four men and five women after she takes up the position. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who chose Lombardelli for the post, said: “Clare brings significant experience to the role, tackling financial and economic issues both domestically and internationally.” Her arrival will come at a crucial time for the central bank, which is under pressure to cut the cost of borrowing to support the economy’s exit from a recession during the second half of last year. Financial markets expect the Bank to begin cutting interest rates in the summer to ease pressure on mortgage payers and indebted businesses. Hunt said Lombardelli would also lead the response to recommendations expected next month from the former US Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke to improve the Bank’s forecasting process, as well as overseeing monetary policy. That response had been expected to come from Broadbent, after sustained criticism of the central bank’s ability to predict the effects that the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine war would have on inflation. Several Conservative MPs, including the chair of the all-party Treasury committee, Harriett Baldwin, have said the Bank carried some of the blame for allowing inflation to rise to its highest level in 40 years after delays to interest rate increases. Jagjit Chadha, the director of the National Institute for Economic & Social Research, wrote last year in the Financial times that Threadneedle Street was “increasingly providing a kind of retirement home for former Treasury officials”. Chadha said he was concerned that the independence of the central bank was becoming compromised by an influx of Treasury officials, including deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, and Sam Woods, the head of the Bank’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority. Lombardelli started her career at the Bank of England, but left to join the civil service in 2005. In 2007 she was deputy director for labour market policy in the Treasury before joining Cameron at 10 Downing Street as the private secretary for economic affairs to the prime minister. While at No 10, she gained first-hand experience of the debt crisis spreading across southern Europe while seconded to the International Monetary Fund where she was part of a team based in the Greek finance ministry to monitor bailout terms during 2010 and 2011. In 2012 she moved to support Osborne as chancellor in the coalition government. Known as one of the architects of austerity alongside Osborne’s colleague Rupert Harrison, Lombardelli later took up a more senior role as Treasury chief economist under the Conservative chancellors Philip Hammond, Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak. Her departure to the OECD early last year had been seen as a blow to the UK government, as she had 20 years’ experience in economic analysis. Bailey said: “I’m really pleased to welcome Clare Lombardelli back to the Bank as deputy governor for monetary policy. Clare’s impressive career means she brings a huge amount of relevant experience and expertise to the MPC, and the Bank more broadly, at a time of great importance for the UK economy.” Nick Macpherson, a former Treasury permanent secretary, said: “Great appointment. Clare is uniquely qualified for this post, combining analytics rigour with excellent judgment.” In a reference to critics of the Bank’s record tackling inflation, he added: “Her anti-inflationary credentials are impeccable.”"

The business said that it would cut roles in its contact centre in Widnes, in Cheshire, at its in-store bakeries and a few at local fulfilment centres, in a cost-cutting drive. Chief executive Simon Roberts said.  “As we move into the next phase of our strategy, we are making some difficult, but necessary decisions,”  “I know today’s news is unsettling for affected colleagues and we will do everything we can to support them.”  The supermarket will reduce its workforce by around 1,500 jobs, but subject to consultation. It said the money it saves will be reinvested into the business to give customers “great value, quality and service.” At Widnes a “vast majority” of Sainsbury’s staff will see their employment move to a different company, while its stores will move to “a more efficient way of freshly baking products”. The blow comes as administrators running The Body Shop announce plans to close 75 stores across the UK in the next six weeks with the loss of 489 jobs. Here’s the full list.

All of Sainsbury’s Careline services will now be run by this external company, Sainsbury’s said. It also plans to move more of its shops “to a more efficient way of freshly baking products”. Investment in technology and automation also mean Sainsbury’s needs fewer local fulfilment centres. A “very small proportion” of staff will be impacted and could be helped to find new roles where possible, it says.     3.45pm GMT   Announcing the plan to cut 1,500 jobs, Sainsbury’s chief executive Simon Roberts says:  “As we move into the next phase of our strategy, we are making some difficult, but necessary decisions.” “I know today’s news is unsettling for affected colleagues and we will do everything we can to support them.”      3.37pm GMT  Sainsbury's plans to cut 1,500 roles  Newsflash: Sainsbury’s has announced plans to cut around 1,500 jobs as part of efforts to reduce costs by £1 billion. The move comes as the UK’s second-largest supermarket chain seeks cost savings to invest back into the business. The jobs will go at its store support centre, its contact centre operations in Widnes, Cheshire, in its in-store bakeries and at some local fulfilment centres. Sainsbury’s says that, where possible, it will find alternative roles for impacted staff, and that the job cuts are subject to consultation.

Bitcoin is up almost 5% today at $63,500, as the rush of cash into new bitcoin ETFs lifts its price (see introduction for details). That means the world’s largest crypto-currency has gained 49% in February alone – the biggest percentage gain since December 2020 (when it jumped by 49.6%). In pure dollar terms, I think it must be the best month ever for bitcoin; its up $20,000 since the start of February, heading towards the all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021:     1.45pm GMT  US jobless claims rise  While US inflation is slowing, more Americans are losing their jobs as higher interest rates hit the economy.

This makes it important that the business provides as much post-employment support to affected staff as possible in terms of potential redeployment and career advice for the future.  But, the decision to keep over half The Body Shop’s stores open suggests the company could recover, she adds:    “Back at base however, the saving of 116 stores provides clear evidence of the company’s resonance with customers and its ability to bounce back – and hopefully move back to a position where it thrives – within a highly challenging retail environment. Ensuring that this resurgence incorporates a level of competitive spirit that allows it to properly enhance its offering will be an important aspect of making this happen, of course.”      12.26pm GMT  Full list of Body Shop stores closing  The administrators running Body Shop have sent a full list of the stores which are to shut in the next four-to-six weeks:  Aylesbury Banbury Barnstaple Basildon Battersea Bedford Beverley Bexleyheath Blackburn Blackpool Bournemouth Commercial Rd Bolton Brixton Broughton Park Bury Camberley Carlisle Carmarthen Chippenham Cirencester Croydon Didcot Durham East Kilbride Edinburgh Gyle Centre Edinburgh Princes Mall Epsom Fareham Farnborough Glasgow Braehead Glasgow Fort Glasgow Silverburn Glasgow Station Grimsby Halifax Harlow Hastings Hempstead Valley High Wycombe Huddersfield Hull Ilford Ipswich Isle of Wight Islington Kendal Kings Lynn Leeds White Rose Lewisham Centre Lichfield Loughborough Luton Macclesfield Middlesbrough Morpeth Newton Abbot Northampton Oldham Perth Peterborough Queensgate Portsmouth Regent Street Salisbury Stafford Stanstead Airside Stratford Upon Avon Swansea Telford Thanet Trowbridge Wakefield Trinity Walk Walthamstow Wigan Woking Wolverhampton      12.22pm GMT  Administrators: We are looking at all options  Tony Wright, joint administrator of The Body Shop, says the administrators are looking at “all options”, having decided to close another 75 stores.

In an email to staff announcing the cuts, EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said the company is moving away from creating new games, and will instead focus on its “owned IP, sports, and massive online communities”. Wilson said the company will stop work on some in-development games and cancel other planned titles “that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry”. Instead, it will “double down” on its existing titles – which includes EAFC, the football game series formerly known as Fifa. He said the company is “leading through an accelerating industry transformation where player needs and motivations have changed significantly”.     11.16am GMT   Over in Ireland, inflation has dropped to its lowest level in two and a half years.

Lombardelli is currently chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, having joined the OECD last year after a long stint working at the UK Treasury. She will succeed Ben Broadbent, currently the Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, on 1st July, on a five-year term. Lombardelli’s departure to the OECD early last year had been seen as a blow to the UK government, as she had 20 years’ experience in economic analysis culminating in serving as the Treasury’s chief economic adviser. She started her career at the Bank of England and has also worked in 10 Downing Street as the Private Secretary for Economic Affairs to prime minister David Cameron (see her LinkedIn profile).   Related: George Osborne escapes unburnt from MPs' budget grilling   The Bank says Lombardelli will oversee the formulation and implementation of UK monetary policy and will lead the Bank’s research, data and analytics.

Clare’s impressive career means she brings a huge amount of relevant experience and expertise to the Monetary Policy Committee, and the Bank more broadly, at a time of great importance for the UK economy.   Updated at 10.33am GMT    9.56am GMT  UK mortgage approvals rise: what the experts say  Here’s some early reaction to UK mortgage approvals hitting their highest level since October 2022 last month. Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, points out that mortgage approvals were the highest since the panicky weeks after the mini-budget of 2022, which drove up borrowing costs:  January’s money and credit figures suggest the drag on consumer spending and the housing market from higher interest rates is easing, which suggests an economic recovery, at least in some sectors, has already begun. The jump in mortgage approvals for house purchase, from 51,506 in December to 55,227 in January (consensus forecast 52,000), took them to the highest level since October 2022, before the spike in mortgage rates following the “mini” budget caused lending to slump.  Tom Bill, head of UK Residential Research at estate agent Knight Frank, says the market is adjusting to the prospect of lower interest rates:  “Buyers and sellers have realised the interest rate landscape has changed meaningfully in the last four months. Rate cut expectations have softened since Christmas but mortgage approvals and transaction numbers are heading in the right direction after a year of stubborn inflation and rising rates in 2023. Both are still a fifth below their five-year average but demand will get stronger as inflation comes under control, which should underpin a 3% UK house price increase in 2024.”  Aaron Milburn, UK managing director at credit intelligence provider Pepper Advantage, says signals that interest rates may have reached their peak have lifted mortgage approvals in January.   The Bank of England has clearly set a path to lower rates as inflation shows signs of steady decline, a move that has breathed new life into the mortgage market as banks pre-emptively lower their fixed-term rates to entice buyers. These moves appear to be paying off after a period of relative stagnation as banks tap into strong mortgage demand.“While the increase in mortgage approvals is a positive sign, other corners of the market remain under significant pressure. Mortgage arrears remain high as the cost-of-living crisis persists – while economically mobile, cash-rich buyers feel that they are able to take on expensive mortgages, we need to remain cognisant that this is not the full picture in a polarised market. For home buyers and economists, all eyes will be on the Bank of England’s next rates decision in March.”      9.43am GMT  UK property sales forecast to rise by 10% this year  The jump in UK mortgage approvals in January (see 9.38am) is the latest sign that activity in the housing market is rallying. Overnight, property website Zoopla has predicted that home sales will rise by 10% this year, following a pick-up in sales and demand in early 2024. Zoopla reports that all measures of activity were higher this month than in February 2023, with agreed sales up by 15% and buyer demand up by 11%. As a result, the market is on track to reach 1.1m transactions across the year, up from 1m in 2023, it said. Across the UK prices were down by 0.5% year-on-year, although this masked regional variations. In Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and the north of England prices increased, but across the south of England they fell.

This is the highest number of new mortgage approvals since October 2022, when the market had been rocked by Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget which led to a jump in mortgage rates. But it’s still well below the levels seen after the first Covid-19 lockdowns: Net approvals for remortgaging remained stable at 30,900 in January. The BoE also reports that the ‘effective’ interest rate on new mortgages fell by 9 basis points, to 5.19% in January, as borrowers benefited from cuts to mortgage rates, following the fall in inflation last year.

Swiss GDP rose by 0.3% in the October-December quarter, beating the 0.1% growth which analysts expected. The Swiss Federal Statistical Office says the services sector was one of the main growth drivers, as tourism recovered following the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Swiss economy grew 0.3% on quarter in Q4 2023, the same as in the previous three month period and beating forecasts of a 0.1% expansion.

Drax, which runs a biomass power plant in North Yorkshire, has posted a pre-tax profit of £796m for 2023, up from £78m in 2022. Shares are up around 6%. Adjusted earnings rose 66% to £1.2bn, as Drax profited from the jump in power prices last year. Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, says:  “Drax performed strongly in 2023 and we remained the single largest provider of renewable power by output in the UK. We have created a business which plays an essential role in supporting energy security, providing dispatchable, renewable power for millions of homes and businesses, particularly during periods of peak demand when there is low wind and solar power.  Drax’s results also show it paid £205m to the UK government under its windfall tax, the Electricity Generator Levy, which was extended to low-carbon energy producers in late 2022.

American logistics firm GXO has announced a cash offer for UK haulage firm Wincanton, worth 605p per share. GXO are trying to gate-crash an agreed bid from France’s CEVA Logistics, worth 480p per share for Wincanton. GXO say their offer values Wincanton at £762m, higher than CEVA’s offer of around £600m. Wincanton employs 20,000 people across Britain, shuttling goods around the country for customers such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. Wincanton’s board had been supporting CEVA’s bid. But GXO says today it expects that the Wincanton Board will recommend its offer “in due course”. Shares in Wincanton have jumped 17% to 600p.     8.27am GMT  Ocado shares jump as losses narrow  In the City… shares in Ocado have jumped almost 7% in early trading after the grocery technology firm narrowed its losses. Ocado has reported it made a pre-tax loss of £394m in 2023, up from a £500m loss in 2022.  Revenues rose almost 10% to £2.8bn, led by its Technology Solutions arm which sells robotic grocery warehouse kit worldwide. Tim Steiner, CEO of Ocado Group, says the company made “good progress” last year, adding:  Our technology is transforming the way people shop for food as we help some of the world’s best and most innovative retailers set the bar for excellence in grocery ecommerce worldwide. We opened three new state-of-the-art robotic CFCs; in Chiba city (near Tokyo) in Japan, Calgary in Canada, and Luton here in the UK and increased the amount of installed capacity for our clients by a quarter. We now have installed capacity at our retail partners for gross annual grocery sales of over £8bn.  On an EBITDA basis (ignoring interest, tax, and the depreciation and amortisation of assets), Ocado made a profit of £54m, up from a £74m EBITDA loss in 2022.

The non-dom status allows about 70,000 people to avoid paying tax on their overseas earnings. Several newspapers report that Hunt has put abolishing non-doms on a list of options being held in reserve in case his fiscal position deteriorates. Hunt is under serious pressure from backbench Conservative MPs to announce tax cuts next week; his problem is that his fiscal firepower has been shrinking. That’s because the City has cut its expectations for interest rate cuts in the future, which means Hunt’s headroom to splash the cash and still see debt falling in five years has fallen. More here.   Related: Hunt considers poaching Labour’s plan to scrap non-domiciled tax rules    Scrapping non-dom status would be a u-turn for Hunt; he has previously argued that it’s in the UK’s interest for the super-rich to stay and spent their money here. It would also potentially mess up the Labour Party’s plans; it hopes to raise £2bn by scrapping non-dom tax breaks to fund the NHS and primary school breakfast clubs.  Updated at 8.18am GMT    7.44am GMT   Other crypto-currencies are also rallying, as bitcoin’s rally lifts interest in the altcoin market.  Ether, the crypto-curency for the Ethereum blockchain platform, is up 4% today at $3,464.  Ether is also up 50% so far this year (matching bitcoin’s rally), and has more than doubled over the last six months. Chris Weston of brokerage Pepperstone says there is “an increasing belief that an Ethereum cash ETF is coming”, and that many in the crypto world see SEC approval as “a matter of when not if”.      7.32am GMT  Bitcoin FOMO is back  FOMO, or fear of missing out, is another factor driving bitcoin higher, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. Ozkardeskaya explains:  The coin’s price is rising exponentially since the week started; a unit of Bitcoin traded at $64’000 per coin yesterday. That’s around $5K shy of the ATH recorded back in 2021, and the strength of the rally makes us think that there is rising FOMO aiming the $100K mark. Of course, I am not saying that Bitcoin will rally straight to that level, but enthusiasm will clearly be back if Bitcoin successfully clears the $69K offers. From a fundamental perspective, the price surge makes sense. Supply is limited, demand is surging, hodlers aren’t willing to sell and the arrival of Bitcoin ETFs made the asset class more investable for big players. And indeed, spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed $6bn since their inception, and BlackRock’s ETF saw a whopping $520 million inflows in a single day. It was apparently the second biggest inflow into a US ETF, all asset classes included.   Ozkardeskaya cautions, though, that the price moves in cryptocurrencies are driven by a fair amount of speculation and so there could be big fluctuations, adding:  Some already call for a 20% downside correction after the rally is done.      7.24am GMT  WSJ: SEC investigating whether OpenAI investors were misled  US regulators are reportedly probing artificial intelligence pioneer OpenAI, the organisation behind the ChatGPT chatbot, following its boardroom turmoil three months ago. The Wall Street Journal reports this morning that the Securities and Exchange Commission is “scrutinizing internal communications” by OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman as part of an investigation into whether the company’s investors were misled. The WSJ says:  The regulator, whose probe hasn’t previously been reported, has been seeking internal records from current and former OpenAI officials and directors, and sent a subpoena to OpenAI in December, according to people familiar with the matter. That followed the OpenAI board’s decision in November to fire Altman as CEO and oust him from the board. At the time, directors said Altman hadn’t been “consistently candid in his communications,” but didn’t elaborate.  Altman returned as CEO less than two weeks later as part of a deal that also entailed a reconstituted board, which he hasn’t joined. SEC officials based in New York are conducting the investigation and have asked that some senior OpenAI officials preserve internal documents.   ⚠️BREAKING:*SEC INVESTIGATING WHETHER OPENAI INVESTORS WERE MISLED: WSJ pic.twitter.com/gEeK8KF24Y— Investing.com (@Investingcom) February 29, 2024  Altman was dramatically dismissed by OpenAI’s board in November, and then sensationally rehired a week later after a staff revolt:   Related: ‘Huge egos are in play’: behind the firing and rehiring of OpenAI’s Sam Altman   News of the SEC’s move comes as Altman holds talks with investors to raise trillions of dollars to reshape the global semiconductor industry.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is heading towards its alltime high, as crypto mania returns to the markets. Bitcoin is continuing its wild ride this morning, up another 4% today at over $63,000. This takes bitcoin’s gains so far this year to 50% (and it’s still only February, just!). This puts bitcoin in sight of its alltime high of almost $69,000, set in November 2021, before it fell back during 2022. Bitcoin’s gains in recent weeks have been driven by the launch of new Bitcoin ETFs, approved by US regulators last month, which make it easier to trade bitcoin. There have been large client inflows into the ETFs launched in recent weeks by investment groups such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Those ETFs are buying up bitcoins – at a rate faster than they are being created, or that long-time holders are willing to sell. This is pushing up the price.   Related: The SEC has approved bitcoin ETFs. What are they and what does it mean for investors?   Another factor is that a bitcoin halving event takes place in April. This will cut the reward for mining bitcoins, which is designed to slow the supply of new coins into the market. One bitcoin bull, MicroStrategy, has also added to the rally by revealing this week it has bought another 3,000 bitcoin. Trading is jittery, though – yesterday bitcoin approached the $64,000 mark, before dropping back and finishing above $60,000. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, says the market is setting up to “test and likely break” the November 2021 all time $69,000 high. Sycamore explains:  Bitcoin’s resurrection from the crypto winter is comparable to that of the mythical Phoenix of Greek legend. But here we have a new legend taking shape, and whether it lasts for 500 years like the Phoenix, as Bitcoins proponents might hope, remains to be seen. Bitcoin’s gains in recent weeks have been driven by record client inflows into the newly minted Bitcoin ETF’s. Amongst other reasons are anticipation of the Bitcoin halving event in April, concerns over a partial US government shutdown, and MicroStrategy’s Michael Naylor adding 3000 Bitcoins to his already considerable holdings.  This tweet from last night shows how volumes into bitcoin ETFs have been rising:  The busiest day yet for bitcoin ETFs just wrapped up.$7.65 billion in traded volume, which is $3 billion higher than the second-most active day.Now for the after-hours bid as they buy BTC for their clients 👀 https://t.co/55Knt2tYBO pic.twitter.com/gsFGNiQ3kX— Joe Consorti ⚡ (@JoeConsorti) February 28, 2024  Also coming up today Growth data from India, Canada and Switzerland will give us more insight into how the world economy fared in the last quarter of last year.

        "content": "The Treasury committee on Thursday opened an investigation looking at the effectiveness of the UK’s economic sanctions on Russia, including whether the measures need to be widened to cover the buyers of Russian oil and gas. The MPs will take evidence on the work of the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), part of the Treasury, which implements and enforces the sanctions in the UK, including on implementation within the insurance and shipping sectors. The committee will examine whether the sanctions regime should be broadened to include entities buying Russian oil and gas, as well as looking at whether assets frozen as part of the UK’s financial sanctions on Russia should be confiscated and whether there is legal precedent for such a move. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has previously boasted about his country’s ability to withstand to western sanctions. The International Energy Agency said last May that Russian oil supply “continued to prove resilient”. Russian oil exports reached a post-invasion high last April of 8.3m barrels of oil a day amid increased exports to India and China. Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said that two years on after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow was still able to plough money into its defence budget, which posed the question of whether western sanctions were having the desired effect. She said: “We must not let up in our efforts to plug every possible gap which Putin and his cronies exploit to get around our sanctions. Our committee is aiming to identify any areas within the UK’s purview which we feel could be improved so that, as a country, we can be confident we’re doing our bit to deal a fatal blow to the Kremlin war chest.” Wealthy businessmen have already been bringing legal challenges in London’s high court to try to overturn their designations on the UK sanctions list. This week, lawyers for Eugene Shvidler, a business associate of the oligarch Roman Abramovich, failed in an attempt to persuade the court of appeal to overturn UK restrictions imposed on him in a key legal test of the UK sanctions regime. The case was being closely watched by other oligarchs under sanctions because of their links with Russia. Shvidler has already signalled he will appeal to the UK’s supreme court."

        "content": "Ocado has threatened to sue Marks & Spencer over a multimillion-pound payment linked to their online joint venture. M&S, which owns 50% of Ocado Retail, is withholding part of the £190m final payment after their delivery tie-up failed to hit certain performance targets. Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, told reporters on Thursday he believed M&S owed it a “substantial amount of money” and if a settlement was not agreed the online grocery specialist could pursue litigation against M&S to retrieve more of the final payment it believed it was owed. His comments came after Ocado posted a pre-tax loss of £394m for the 12 months to 3 December 2023, which compared with the previous year’s loss of £500m. When M&S struck a deal to buy half of the Ocado Retail joint venture in 2019, as part of its move into the online delivery sector, it agreed to pay an initial £562m with a final payment of £190m to be made based on whether the tie-up met certain performance targets. During 2023, Ocado failed to meet the targets that would have automatically led to the payment being made, with accounting rules estimating that the payment should come to just £28m. However, Ocado said in its accounts that that arrangement stated that targets could be adjusted if management had to take decisions or actions that differed from the assumptions when the deal was struck. It said the criteria for the final payment should be revised to take into account “significant decisions and actions” taken during the Covid-19 pandemic. It added that the £28m was “significantly lower than the amount that Ocado believes it will receive in the future (either via a formal litigation process or settlement).” On Thursday, Steiner told reporters that the current payment being suggested was “ludicrously low” and that Ocado had a strong case for full payment. He said: “We would much rather solve this in a nice and constructive way, which is what we’re working towards doing. We are very confident that we are owed a substantial sum of money and ultimately I hope we will never get there but we will not walk away from that sum of money.” An M&S Spokesman said: “M&S remains committed to the turnaround strategy for Ocado Retail and our focus is on working with them and Ocado Group to deliver it. “On the specific issue of the contractual contingency payment, our advice is that the financial performance of Ocado Retail means the criteria for the performance payment was not met.” On Thursday, the Ocado group revealed that its pre-tax loss for the year was reduced after it secured £187m from a settlement with its Norwegian rival AutoStore after a case in the high court. Group revenues increased by 9.9% to £2.8bn over the year, with this figure largely driven by the company’s technology solutions business, which enjoyed 44% growth to £420.5m for the year."

        "content": "The owner of British Airways has announced bumper profits for 2023 on the back of sustained demand for leisure flights, with operating profits doubling year on year and exceeding 2019’s pre-Covid haul. IAG reported an annual profit of €2.7bn (£2.3bn) after tax, on operating profits of €3.5bn (£3bn), with high fares and premium leisure travel compensating for smaller numbers of business travellers. The airline group said demand continued to be strong, despite the impact of a recession in the UK, although it did not expect a further significant rise in fares after large increases in 2023. Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said: “We don’t see any weakness in the market.” He said the group had last year “more than doubled its operating margin and profits compared with 2022, generated excellent free cashflow and strengthened its balance sheet position, recovering capacity to close to pre-Covid-19 levels in most of its core markets”. British Airways, which retired its Boeing 747 jumbos during the pandemic, was flying at only 90% of its previous capacity, partly because of the continued weakness or closure of some destinations in Asia, but would return to near 2019 levels this year, with more frequencies on transatlantic routes. IAG’s chief financial officer, Nicholas Cadbury, said: “With a good fare increase over the last year, right now we are looking at growing our capacity by about 7%. We’re seeing fares being sustained at the moment … So it’s good news, but our priority is to make sure we just fill in that additional capacity.” The British national carrier is also planning a £7bn overhaul over the next few years, including the purchase of new planes but also investing in updating its business-class seats, lounges and food. It is also revamping its IT systems after a series of high-profile problems in recent years. Gallego said: “British Airways is our biggest asset with huge potential and that’s the reason we are investing.” Meanwhile, IAG announced the appointment of new chief executives for British Airways’s Spanish sister airlines in the group, with the Vueling boss, Marco Sansavini, taking over at Iberia, replacing the interim chief, Fernando Candela, who moves to run Level, while a former British Airways director, Carolina Martinoli, takes over at Vueling."

        "content": "A surge in employment combined with scant investment by firms to improve output triggered a sharp drop in worker productivity, limiting prospects for income growth without fanning inflation, the Productivity Commission said in its annual report. Across the economy, productivity fell 3.7% in 2022-23, as output growth failed to keep pace with a record 6.9% increase in hours worked, the commission said. A rush by employers to hire new staff was much higher than in previous bursts – the nearest comparison was the 4.3% rise in hours worked in 1988-89. “Australians’ incomes grew in 2022-23, mostly because they worked more hours,” said the commission’s deputy chair, Alex Robson. “But productivity growth is about working smarter, not working harder or longer.”   Related: Inflation remains flat at 3.4% in January, fuelling hopes of RBA interest rate cut   With labour market participation hovering near its record 67%, the economy has little scope to generate higher incomes by adding workers or time on the job, he said. “What’s worse, we know nominal wage growth without productivity growth can fuel inflation,” Robson said. “Sustainable, long-term wage growth can only be realised by securing productivity gains.” Employers, though, were also not doing their bit. The capital-to-labour ratio, one measure of spending on equipment to improve output, fell by a record 4.9% for the year.  “So while a record number of Australians had jobs, employers didn’t invest in the equipment, tools and resources that are needed to make the most of employees’ skills and talents,” Robson said. “Further capital investment would help turn our strong employment growth into strong productivity growth.”  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Reserve Bank has been one of the economic institutions to warn wage increases had to be accompanied by increased productivity to avoid adding to inflation pressures and delaying any interest rate cuts. In its latest statement on monetary policy, released at its first board meeting of 2024, the RBA listed productivity outcomes as among “still highly uncertain” outcomes in its forecast for how fast inflation may fall back to its 2%-3% target range. “Other things equal, poor productivity outcomes would underpin higher-than-expected costs for businesses and put upward pressure on the prices paid by consumers,” it said. Wages rose 4.2% last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, or slightly faster than the 4.1% inflation rate. That was the first time in about two years that the wage price index had exceeded its consumer price equivalent. Still, economists have been wary about reading too much into recent poor productivity results. One issue has been the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic disruptions, with many people spending more time working from home. And, as the Productivity Commission itself notes, the decline in hourly output per worker was partly the result of some of the extra hours worked being taken up by “less experienced or less productive labour”. Many of those jobs were also in “relatively low‑productivity sectors” such as retailing and hospitality, the report said. With the unemployment rate now creeping up to 4.1% in January from a half-century low of 3.4% in October 2022, output per hour was also beginning to improve. “The decline in labour productivity appears to have halted in the first quarter of the 2023-24 financial year, although this is largely attributable to a fall in hours worked,” the bulletin said. By industry, labour productivity grew most in the professional, scientific and technical services sector, with a 3% increase. The wholesale trade industry posted the largest fall, at 11.4%, as hours worked jumped 15.7%. All up, 11 out of the 16 market sector industries reported a decline."

        "published_date": "2024-02-29T12:35:35+00:00",
        "content": "The Body Shop is to close 75 stores across the UK in the next six weeks with the loss of 489 jobs, according to administrators who are overseeing the restructuring. The closures are spread across the country, from Swansea to Glasgow, and mean that nearly 800 people will lose their jobs in total when the 300 redundancies at the head office are taken into account. However, 116 Body Shop stores will stay open under the changes, which affect only the company’s UK operations, the administration firm FRP said. Body Shop Denmark has declared bankruptcy, while its division in Belgium, with 16 stores and 50 employees, has reportedly also been declared bankrupt. The Irish business is expected to go into liquidation next week. Before the closures, the brand had about 1,000 company-owned stores worldwide and a further 1,600 franchise branches. Last week, the administrators at FRP laid out plans to retain more than half of Body Shop stores in the UK as they announced the closure of seven shops. On Thursday, they told staff an additional 75 stores would close over the next four to six weeks. The retailer, which employs more than 2,200 people in the UK, called in administrators in mid-February, just months after being taken over by the restructuring firm Aurelius in November. Tony Wright, the joint administrator, said: “In taking swift action to right-size the Body Shop UK store portfolio, we have stabilised the business and are providing the best opportunity for this iconic brand to have a long-term, sustainable future. “The UK business continues to trade in administration, and we remain fully focused on exploring all options to take the business forward.” Aurelius is the main creditor, with secured debt that will ensure it gets paid by administrators before most other creditors. One option is that it takes back the chain after the shop closures and job cuts. Alternatively, the administrators could begin a formal sale process for the remaining stores. The UK fashion retailer Next, which has snapped up a host of brands, from Cath Kidston to Fatface, is thought to be among industry names that are interested. The Body Shop has had three owners since it was sold by its founder, Anita Roddick, shortly before her death in 2007. Roddick, who set up the business in Brighton in 1976, campaigned against animal testing of cosmetics and promoted natural products sourced ethically in a way that would support small producers around the world. She shocked fans of the brand by selling up to L’Oréal in 2006, the cosmetics multinational that owns Maybelline and Garnier, for £652m. The brand was then sold on to the Brazilian natural cosmetics group Natura, which already owned the Australian Aesop beauty brand, for €1bn in 2017. After Natura built up debts in buying the home-selling cosmetics group Avon, it sold off Aesop to L’Oréal and then The Body Shop to Aurelius late last year. The Body Shop’s popularity has waned in recent years as competition heated up from rivals in the natural beauty market, including Lush and Rituals, and the boom in internet sales has affected bricks and mortar retail. The group’s Irish, Japanese and some of its mainland European divisions were sold to a group called Alma24 in late January, whose main director has close links to Aurelius. The German division of The Body Shop, which has about 60 stores, was put into insolvency two weeks ago. The Irish operations, where 50 people work at seven stores, was expected to go into liquidation next week and employees refused to work on Thursday after being told they would not be paid for the last three weeks of their employment, the Irish Examiner reported. The Body Shop’s Denmark division was declared bankrupt on Wednesday, with 15 stores to close and 90 job losses. Anders Hoffmann Kønigsfeldt, a lawyer at the law firm Bech-Bruun, has been appointed as administrator. There are a few Body Shop stores owned by franchisees that are not affected by the bankruptcy. Tine Mohr Jensen, a senior retail manager at The Body Shop in Denmark, wrote in a LinkedIn post: “It’s tough to say goodbye to something that has been such a big part of my life for over 12 years. The Body Shop will always be cherished. I hope from the bottom of my heart The Body Shop will stand strong again all over the world.” The UK stores due to close in the next six weeks AylesburyBanburyBarnstapleBasildonBatterseaBedfordBeverleyBexleyheathBlackburnBlackpoolBournemouth Commercial RoadBoltonBrixtonBroughton ParkBuryCamberleyCarlisleCarmarthenChippenhamCirencesterCroydonDidcotDurhamEast KilbrideEdinburgh Gyle CentreEdinburgh Princes MallEpsomFarehamFarnboroughGlasgow BraeheadGlasgow FortGlasgow SilverburnGlasgow StationGrimsbyHalifaxHarlowHastingsHempstead ValleyHigh WycombeHuddersfieldHullIlfordIpswichIsle of WightIslingtonKendalKing’s LynnLeeds White RoseLewisham CentreLichfieldLoughboroughLutonMacclesfieldMiddlesbroughMorpethNewton AbbotNorthamptonOldhamPerthPeterborough QueensgatePortsmouthRegent StreetSalisburyStaffordStansted AirsideStratford Upon AvonSwanseaTelfordThanetTrowbridgeWakefield Trinity WalkWalthamstowWiganWokingWolverhampton"

        "content": "Roads, roads and more roads. The US is continuing to spend billions of dollars on expanding enormous highways rather than fund public transport, with a landmark infrastructure bill lauded by Joe Biden only further accelerating the dominance of cars at the expense, critics say, of communities and the climate. Since the passage of the enormous $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021, hailed by Biden as a generational effort to upgrade the US’s crumbling bridges, roads, ports and public transit, money has overwhelmingly poured into the maintenance and widening of roads rather than improving the threadbare network of bus, rail and cycling options available to Americans, a new analysis has found.   Related: Do electric cars have an air pollution problem?   Of reported funds dispersed to states, more than half – around $70bn – have been spent on the resurfacing and expansion of highways, a process that researchers have consistently found only spurs greater use of cars and therefore more congestion. Just a fifth of the money has gone so far to public transit, with much of the remainder also facilitating more car driving, such as the refurbishment of bridges.  Interactive  This spending is a “climate time bomb”, according to the new Transportation for America analysis, which calculates that more than 178m tons of greenhouse gases will be emitted due to planned highway expansions by 2040, only slightly offset by emissions-reducing measures that also stem from the bill. “We’re seeing investments that are not too conscious of the climate across the board from states,” said Corrigan Salerno, policy associate at Transportation for America, a transport policy group. “Nothing is fundamentally changing in terms of modes of transport. This much money going into highway expansion is, for one, a liability into the future, and two, it just doesn’t work. We’ve been expanding highways for decades on decades, and everyone consistently finds themselves stuck in traffic.” Funding from the federal government has been given to states with broad flexibility on how to use it and state authorities, by and large, have chosen to persist with car-centric infrastructure. The Biden administration’s department of transportation did advise states to prioritize road repair, rather than expansion, and to bear in mind communities, usually of color, that have been severed by highways and are subjected to the resulting air pollution. However, this stance prompted a backlash from Republicans in Congress and been mostly overlooked by states such as Texas and even California, considered a progressive bastion of climate policy, that have pushed ahead plans to add more and more lanes to highways. “So much of the decision making falls to state departments of transportation,” said Mary Buchanan, research and policy manager at TransitCenter, a foundation that aims to improve public transit in the US. “There are essentially 50 opportunities to get this right, I guess, or to potentially get it wrong, in terms of how money is being spent.” The result is that the US will generate more emissions from transport, already its largest source of planet-heating gases, as a result of the infrastructure bill than if it hadn’t passed, according to Salerno. “You have to essentially walk down this giant cliff of emissions that we’re creating into the future because once these highways are built, there’s not really an easy way back from that,” he said. The US’s fixation with hulking roads – along with the growth of supersized cars that are responsible for about 40,000 deaths a year in accidents, a toll that has ticked up in recent years – has led to calls for a rethink. This month, around 200 climate, biking and walkability groups called for a national moratorium on highway expansions due to the ills they bring.   Related: ‘It’s just more and more lanes’: the Texan revolt against giant new highways   “The highway system we have built in our country is unsustainable, both financially and environmentally, and disproportionately harms low-income and Black and brown communities,” an open letter from the coalition says. There is little sign of improved fortunes for public transport, however. Rail and bus services were badly hit during the Covid pandemic, with a lack of commuter revenue causing headaches for several city systems seeking to cover their basic operational costs. Some jurisdictions, meanwhile, appear openly hostile to non-car options. Lawmakers in Indiana this week moved to ban dedicated bus lanes in Indianapolis, while officials in Miami Beach recently rejected a plan to extend a rail line to help alleviate congestion. It was also recently announced the 2026 World Cup final will be held at the MetLife stadium in New Jersey, a facility to which patrons are advised not to walk because the approaches are too dangerous because of cars. Buchanan said the coverage of public transit remains “disparate” across the US and the funding of it requires a new approach from states. “If states continue to spend this new money in the same ways that they’ve spent it in the past, we will continue to expand highways and really cement ourselves to our car oriented kind of way of getting around,” she said. “So it’s a very pivotal moment. There’s definitely an opportunity for our emissions from the transportation sector to really increase as a result of these infrastructure bills, which would be really bad.” A US department of transportation spokesman said the Biden administration has taken the “strongest actions of any administration in history to reduce carbon pollution in transportation with the largest investment in public transit in American history, the largest investment in passenger rail since the inception of Amtrak, record levels of funding to support active transportation – like walking and biking – and historic investments in zero-emission buses, electric vehicles, and charging infrastructure.”"

        "content": "US regulators are investigating internal communications from the OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, as part of an inquiry into whether investors into the technology company were misled, reports claim. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into emails and internal records of directors and officials at the ChatGPT creator after it issued a subpoena in December, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The decision to investigate comes after Altman was ousted as the boss of the San Francisco-based company in November after the board accused him of being not “consistently candid in his communications”, adding that it “no longer had confidence in his ability to lead”. However, less than a week later he was reinstated to the top job, and a new board was brought in, after the 750-strong workforce at the Microsoft-backed company threatened to resign if he wasn’t brought back. According to the WSJ report on Wednesday, people familiar with the SEC inquiry said the investigation was a predictable response to the comments made by the board when Altman was originally sacked. The report also said the SEC had not pointed to any specific statement or communication by Altman that it believed might be misleading. The SEC often concludes investigations without making accusations of wrongdoing. News of the SEC investigation comes as OpenAI’s ChatGPT product, which was launched in November 2022, has received worldwide popularity, resulting in the company being recently valued at $80bn (£63bn). However, the artificial intelligence company is facing several investigations by regulators and government bodies into its operations. The US Federal Trade Commission announced in January that it had launched an investigation into Open AI and other tech firms, including Amazon and the Google owner, Alphabet, to look into AI investments and consider how they affect competition in the sector. Separately, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK said in December it would look into the partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft, its biggest investor. The Guardian has contacted OpenAI and Microsoft for comment."

        "published_date": "2024-02-29T11:00:16+00:00",
        "content": "Some of the US’s most profitable corporations, including General Motors, Citigroup and Netflix, have slashed their tax bills in the years since the passage of the Trump tax cuts, with nearly a quarter paying rates in the single digits and 23 paying nothing, a report has found. The 2017 law cut the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. But the new assessment of corporate tax avoidance, published on Thursday by the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep), found that during the first five years the law was in effect, many profitable public companies in the US paid a far lower rate in practice.   Related: Citigroup to cut 20,000 jobs after steep quarterly loss   Together, the 342 corporations studied by Itep paid an average effective tax rate of just 14.1%. Eighty-seven companies paid an average of less than 10%; 55 of those firms paid less than 5%; and 23 corporations, including T-Mobile US and Xcel Energy, paid zero (or less) federal income tax over the five-year period – even though they made a profit each year. Among the lowest taxpayers were companies including Netflix and Nike, as well as several corporations whose CEOs have become high-profile advocates for corporate social responsibility and “stakeholder capitalism”, such as Salesforce and Bank of America. In the five years since the Trump tax law took effect, “the biggest and most profitable companies don’t appear to be paying anywhere close to that 21% rate”, said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at Itep and the lead author of the report. “What Trump described as a big tax cut turned out to be just that.” Between 2018 and 2022, Bank of America brought home more than $138bn in profits, yet the company paid only $5.3bn in federal income tax – an effective rate of 3.8%, Itep found. Bank of America was recently named the second most “just” company in the United States by Just Capital, a non-profit that ranks US corporations by how well they “perform[] on the issues that matter”, like serving their communities. Fortune magazine has called the Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, “the king of stakeholder capitalism”, a term that describes the notion that corporations today are taking care of not just their executives and shareholders but all of society. In 2020, Marc Benioff, the co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, declared to the New York Times that “it’s time for a new kind of capitalism: stakeholder capitalism, which recognizes that our companies have a responsibility to all our stakeholders”.   Related: Nike to axe hundreds of jobs in bid to save $2bn amid sales slump   During the first five years of the Trump law, however, Salesforce paid only $175m in taxes on some $6bn in profits, according to the Itep report. “There appears to be a substantial overlap between the companies that are routinely avoiding corporate income taxes and the companies whose leaders seem to have laudable charitable aims,” Gardner said. “No one would doubt that Marc Benioff wants to do good things in the world. He just doesn’t seem to prioritize doing it in the way that the law says he should. He wants to do it his way.” The Itep report makes clear that the companies listed in the report aren’t breaking the law. “Tax avoidance occurs because Congress chooses to allow it,” the report notes, “either by enacting special exceptions and breaks from the regular tax rules, or by leaving in place loopholes that are clearly being exploited.” Congress is currently considering additional exceptions that could help corporations lower their 2022 tax bills even further, the report warns. A bipartisan tax package that recently passed the House of Representatives, for which corporate interests have been lobbying aggressively for months, includes a tax break that would allow businesses to immediately deduct the costs of “research and development” conducted in the United States. The Trump tax law requires firms to spread out the deductions over time, rather than claiming them all at once, starting in 2022. But the tax deal currently moving through Congress would roll back that limitation for domestic investments – and do so retroactively. That means companies could update their 2022 (and 2023) tax filings to claim billions of dollars in new deductions, ostensibly to reward them for investing in research and development – even though the only thing that would have changed is the text of the tax code. “By definition, extending them backwards in time … can’t encourage a dime of additional research,” Gardner said.   Related: Mark Zuckerberg to receive $700m from Meta dividends   While limited corporate disclosures make it difficult to say precisely how much money companies could claw back, the available data suggests that this single, retroactive policy tweak could potentially save some firms billions of dollars – and that the benefits “would be hugely concentrated in the hands of a very small number of corporations”, Gardner said. Meta, for instance, might be able to shave its tax bill by nearly $6.5bn, the report found, which would bring its average effective tax rate below 0% over the five-year period of the study. Microsoft could potentially save a similar sum. “I always go back to that social contract of our company with the world around us,” Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, told Just Capital in 2020. “You can’t exist if all you’re doing is benefiting yourself … Profit [comes] because of the larger surplus you’re creating around you.” “The whole point of having a tax system is to pay for all the important services that we need,” Gardner said. “Healthcare isn’t sexy, right? Education isn’t sexy. Making sure that we have the money we need to defend ourselves as a nation isn’t sexy. But these basic bread-and-butter needs are why we have a tax system.”"

        "content": "Buyers and sellers continued to return to the property market in February, and are expected to boost the number of home sales by 10% this year, according to the latest data from property website Zoopla. All measures of activity were higher than in February 2023, the company said, with agreed sales up by 15% and buyer demand up by 11%. As a result, the market is on track to reach 1.1m transactions across the year, up from 1m in 2023, it said. Across the UK prices were down by 0.5% year-on-year, although this masked regional variations. In Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and the north of England prices increased, but across the south of England they fell. While Belfast recorded a 4.3% rise in prices, in the east of England there was a 2.1% drop. The areas experiencing falls were those with the highest prices, where buyers have been most hit by affordability problems caused by rising mortgage rates and other increased living costs. Last summer, rates on fixed-rate mortgages reached their highest level since 2008 as the money markets responded to the rising base rate. Since the Bank of England paused rate increases, after the move up to 5.25% in August, prices on mortgage deals had been falling, and Zoopla said this had supported the upturn in activity “along with faster growth in household incomes”. However, it noted that the cheapest, sub-4%, mortgages were now being pulled by lenders. “Buyers should anticipate 4-5% mortgage rates over much of 2024, consistent with flat to low single-digit price rises,” it said. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while the increase in activity was good news for sellers, the housing market still faces “some serious hurdles”. She said: “Falling mortgage rates at the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024 made the key difference in boosting market optimism, and rates are starting to rise again. They’re still only roughly where they were a year ago, and the average two-year rate is still under 5.75%, but a rise may persuade some buyers to press pause.” Coles added that in the south, excluding London, “we’re seeing the impact of relentless eye-watering price rises over the past few years. As a result, affordability is a major problem, and we’re still seeing asking prices drop significantly”."

        "content": "Family Dollar Stores has been ordered to pay $41.675m – the largest criminal penalty in a food safety case – after getting caught using a rodent-infested warehouse to distribute food, cosmetic and medical device products to more than 400 stores in the US. After conducting an investigation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) discovered “live rodents, dead and decaying rodents, rodent feces, urine, and odors, and evidence of gnawing and nesting”, according to a statement released by the US Department of Justice.   Related: FDA removes 1,100 dead rodents from Arkansas Family Dollar facility   In a federal court hearing in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Monday, Family Dollar pleaded guilty to using their distribution center located in West Memphis, Arkansas, to ship products to hundreds of stores across Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee. Family Dollar has more than 8,000 stores in all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The company began receiving complaints from some of its stores about issues with mice and other pests – including receiving rodents and rodent-damaged products from the warehouse – in August 2020. By January 2021, Family Dollar admitted it was aware of the unsanitary conditions of the warehouse which caused products there to be in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The following year, in January 2022, the extent of the unsanitary conditions of the warehouse was revealed after an FDA inspection, which found the presence of live, dead and decaying rodents along with feces, urine and other odors, as well as evidence of gnawing and nesting throughout the building. Subsequent fumigation of the building exterminated 1,270 rodents. Despite the brand’s awareness of the complaints from its stores, Family Dollar continued shipping products from the infested warehouse to its stores. The plea agreement requires Family Dollar and former rival Dollar Tree, which became the same company under the name Dollar Tree Inc in 2015, to give reports and meet “robust corporate compliance” over the next three years. “When consumers go to the store, they have the right to expect that the food and drugs on the shelves have been kept in clean, uncontaminated conditions,” said the Department of Justice’s acting associate attorney general Benjamin C Mizer. “When companies violate that trust and the laws designed to keep consumers safe, the public should rest assured: the justice department will hold those companies accountable.” In a statement shared by Dollar Tree Inc on Monday, the organization disclosed various “enhancements to strengthen safety and compliance” that it has developed in the wake of this penalty. Those enhancements include “new compliance and safety roles, hiring experienced personnel to strengthen the Company’s practices” and new “risk-based procedures and controls”. The company also said that each of its “distribution centers has passed an independent, third-party audit and became ‘Good Distribution Practices’ (‘GDP’) certified, with all distribution centers planning to maintain the distinguished certification”. Dollar Tree’s chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling, said in the statement that he was “very disappointed to learn about these unacceptable issues at one of Family Dollar’s facilities” when he joined the company in March 2022. “Since that time and even more directly when I assumed the role of CEO, we have worked diligently to help Family Dollar resolve this historical matter and significantly enhance our policies, procedures, and physical facilities to ensure it is not repeated,” he said. Family Dollar did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-28T18:48:37+00:00",
        "content": "The UK government will look to raise as much as £3bn-£4bn from selling a chunk of its shares in NatWest bank to the public in a measure expected to be announced by the chancellor in his budget next week.  Jeremy Hunt said in his autumn statement last year that he would “explore options” for a retail offering of part of the state’s remaining one-third share in the bank, now worth about £6.7bn. The government stake in NatWest is what remains from the 84% holding taken by the taxpayer at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, the UK government bailed out the bank, then called Royal Bank of Scotland, to the tune of £45.5bn to help save the UK’s financial system from collapse. It is understood that Treasury officials, after consulting stockbrokers and investment platforms, now believe that multibillion-pound sums can be raised by offering shares to the public. The chancellor’s plans were given a boost after NatWest this month reported a 20% jump in pre-tax profits to £6.2bn in the year to December 2023, its biggest annual profit since the 2007 financial crisis. Rising interest rates have increased revenues for many banks, as they charged higher rates for loans than those offered on savings products.  The bank also confirmed Paul Thwaite would become NatWest chief executive after his predecessor, Alison Rose, was forced to step down last July after a de-banking row with politician Nigel Farage. The Treasury has been told there is likely to be appetite from retail investors given that there is £300bn-plus of savings sitting in cash ISAs and other savings accounts. After the Bank of England began raising interest rates in late 2021, money flowed into higher-paying cash ISAs but interest rates are expected tostart falling again this year, making cash savings less attractive. This could increase investor appetite for NatWest shares if the stocks are priced at a discount. In his speech last year, Hunt referred to the mass privatisations of the 1980s when shares in British Gas were advertised to members of the public with the “tell Sid” slogan. Hunt said in November he would look at options for a retail share offer within 12 months but this would be “subject to supportive market conditions and achieving value for money.” The chancellor told parliament that the potential NatWest sale was part of further capital market reforms aimed at keeping the UK as an attractive centre to start and list a company. The last major retail share offering by the government was the flotation of Royal Mail in 2013, which attracted about 700,000 retail investors. The government considered offering shares in Lloyds Banking Group, in which it took a stake during 2008, to the public in 2015 but later dropped the plans in 2016. The government exited its holding in Lloyds in 2017. This time M&C Saatchi, the advertising agency, has already been hired to create a campaign around the NatWest shares. Other appointments are understood to include Computershare, NatWest’s existing registrar, as “receiving agent” to handle the administration around the offer. The UK government is also in talks with brokers including AJ Bell and Hargreaves Lansdown to help market the shares, in a development first reported by Bloomberg. It is not clear, however, whether Hunt will use a NatWest offer to simultaneously launch a so-called “Brit Isa”, a proposal to add £5,000 or £10,000 to existing ISAs allowances but only for investment in UK-listed companies. Some broking firms are understood to be lukewarm because of the extra costs of ensuring compliance. The chief risk to the NatWest share sale is thought to be the price of the shares to be sold. “This is only going to work for the government if the discount to the market price is chunky,” said one adviser. AJ Bell declined to comment. Hargreaves Lansdown said: “NatWest has generated strong interest from clients and we’d expect this to grow rapidly over the next couple of months,” said Tim Jacobs, head of primary markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Given that people can already buy NatWest in the secondary market, the discount offered in the share sale is going to be a major factor in how well the offer gets away.” The Treasury has been contacted for comment."

        "content": "Britain’s power stations are to command record prices to keep the lights on later this decade, amid concerns over a lack of electricity supply to meet a boom in demand. Plants secured an all-time high price of £65 a kilowatt per year for 2027-28 in a “capacity market” auction to supply power, outstripping the £63 per kW a year planned for 2026-2027, National Grid’s electricity system operator said. The annual auction sets a subsidy price to pay owners of power generators – including gas, hydroelectric, wind and solar projects – and battery storage facilities to cover the cost of meeting the nation’s electricity demand. The costs are covered through consumer bills. In total, power plants are expected to be paid £2.7bn to ensure power demand is met in 2027-28. Longer-term, 15-year contracts for refurbishing and building new projects, including nearly 1,000 megawatts worth of new battery storage projects, were also handed out, worth £1.7bn.   Related: Gas’s future looks cloudy as demand and prices tumble   The result represents the first time that energy companies have not snapped up all the capacity offered up – with 43.3 gigawatts of power secured against a target of 44 gigawatts. The auction’s result has raised concerns that Britain could struggle to meet the increase in demand from everything from electric vehicles to heat pumps while efforts to create new power sources falter. National Grid is attempting to speed up the time taken for new projects to connect to the grid, while major projects have been held up. The Hinkley Point C power plant project in Somerset is years late and billions over budget, while the offshore wind industry has suffered due to a supply chain squeeze. Analysts said that two key projects, as well as a collection of smaller assets, did not secure contracts, tightening the gap between supply and demand and pushing up the price. A proposed open-cycle gas turbine plant at the Eggborough power station site in North Yorkshire – owned by an investment vehicle controlled by the billionaire West Ham United investor Daniel Křetínský – pulled out. A separate new gas plant at Killingholme, the site of an existing station owned by Germany’s Uniper, was also initially entered into the auction before later dropping out. “This was enough to cause the auction to clear at an all-time high price, as total capacity supply dropped beneath the demand curve,” said Fintan Devenney, a senior energy analyst at EnAppSys.The results underscore industry concerns over whether to invest in gas assets amid a sharp fall in wholesale prices in recent months – after a spike following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – as well as the ability to meet booming electricity demand as Britain tries to reach net zero carbon by 2050. Industry sources said that uncertainty over future policies on decarbonisation, and the future of new technologies such as carbon capture and storage projects and the use of hydrogen power, may have deterred some energy companies from entering the auction. Power generators were in the spotlight as the energy crisis escalated and electricity prices – pegged to the price of gas – soared in 2022. A levy on low carbon generators’ profits was introduced. Gas-fired power plants have also faced scrutiny from the energy watchdog through a crackdown on energy traders “manipulating” markets. A Křetínský-owned power plant was ordered to pay £23m after Ofgem found it unfairly demanded excessive payments. Sam Hollister, the head of energy economics and finance at the consultancy LCP Delta, said the record price was due to “the dramatic drop in the volume of new-build capacity entering the auction as unabated gas stations face uncertainty and low-carbon flexible capacity is yet to come forward in significant volumes”. He added: “In this volatile market, if these concerns are not addressed, this may be the sign of things to come with high clearing prices and little new generation coming forward.” Analysts at Jefferies said SSE and Germany’s RWE were “key winners” in the auction. A separate auction is held a year before the “delivery year” to ensure the lights can be kept on. Earlier this month, this year’s auction allocated an extra £273m to ensure supply meets demand in 2025-26."

        "title": "Labour in power faces dire economic inheritance, says Rachel Reeves",
        "author": "",

        "content": "The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has admitted it would take time for a Labour government to turn Britain around, as she accused the Conservatives of vandalising the economy over the past 14 years. Speaking before next week’s budget, Reeves said the party that wins the next election would have the worst inheritance of any incoming government since the war and that a national mission was needed to kickstart the economy. “I recognise the dire inheritance we would have if we win the election. I am not going to be able to turn everything round overnight. We are going to have to grow the economy. There will be a relentless focus on what we need to grow the economy,” the shadow chancellor said. Referring to a soundbite used by George Osborne before the Conservatives came to power in 2010, Reeves said: “George Osborne promised to fix the nation’s roof. But the Conservatives have broken the windows, kicked the door in and now they’re burning the house down.” Jeremy Hunt is putting the finishing touches to next Wednesday’s budget, with the Treasury massaging down expectations of the size of an anticipated tax giveaway in light of deteriorating forecasts for the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which will give its final, confidential pre-budget assessment to the Treasury on Friday. “I am not going pre-empt what the chancellor does or the forecasts published by the OBR,” Reeves said. “However, we do know that the budget will paint a picture of 14 years of economic failure. The next government – Conservative or Labour – will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.” Sketching out Labour’s critique of the government’s economic record since 2010, Reeves said public debt as a share of national output was at the highest level since the 1960s; debt interest payments were at the highest level since the second world war; taxes as a share of national output were the highest since 1949; the economy was smaller than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022; and the current parliament was on track to be the first in which living standards – as measured by real household disposable incomes – fell. “There needs to be a national mission to kickstart our economy”, she said. “Instead, we’re having a debate in the Conservative party about headroom and what’s best for Rishi Sunak’s leadership.” Hunt will use next week’s speech to say the worst is over for the economy and that it is already recovering from the mild recession that it slipped into in the second half of 2023. But the chancellor’s room for manoeuvre is limited by official forecasts showing he will meet one of his fiscal rules – to have national debt falling in five years’ time – by the narrowest of margins. Reeves has been reluctant to say whether Labour would support any tax cuts Hunt might announce next week, preferring to wait until the OBR publishes its judgment on the the impact of Hunt’s measures after the budget. She rejected accusations that Labour’s plan for the economy differed little from that of the Conservatives. “People will see a real change in our economy under Labour. People will see something they haven’t seen for a long time: an economy that’s growing and creating prosperity,” she said. Reeves said Labour’s growth plan was built on three pillars: stability, investment and reform."

        "content": "Direct Line has rejected a £3.1bn takeover offer from a Belgian rival, saying the proposal “significantly undervalued” the business. In a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, the British insurer said it had received a “highly opportunistic” offer from the Brussels-based Ageas last month and rebuffed it, saying it was “uncertain and unattractive” for shareholders. The rebuttal came after Ageas said earlier on Wednesday that it was in the “preliminary stages” of considering a bid for the Kent-based firm. Direct Line shares reached 205 pence at one point on Wednesday, more than 25% higher than the 163p closing price on Tuesday. Ageas said its proposal was for a cash and share offer that would pay 233p a Direct Line share, 43% more than Tuesday’s closing price. The deal would have involved Direct Line shareholders receiving 100p a share in cash and one newly issued Ageas share for every 25 Direct Line shares they own.  Direct Line said it had received a “highly conditional” and “non-binding indicative proposal” from the rival insurer in mid-January and this had been “unanimously rejected” by its board on 29 January. It said the board was confident of Direct Line’s prospects as a business given a strong strategic positioning, powerful brands and robust capital position. The offer came after a tumultuous period for Direct Line, which has been hit by sluggish profits and payouts to customers after discovering it had breached rules fair pricing. Last March it posted pre-tax losses of £45m, compared with a £446m profit posted in 2021, blaming the hit on soaring inflation, extreme weather and market volatility. The company agreed in July to repay £30m after discovering it had charged existing customers more than new ones for car and home insurance policies. Adam Winslow, the former Aviva UK chief, will take over as Direct Line’s chief executive next week, replacing Penny James who stepped down last year. The company said Winslow would focus on “refreshing the strategy and operational focus of the group with the clear objective of returning to a sustainable level of operating profit over time”. Ageas said on Wednesday it was confident in the underlying attractiveness and future opportunities of the UK personal lines insurance sector. “Over the long term, the UK personal lines sector has proven to be structurally profitable and, through its own UK operations, Ageas sees its strong potential,” it said. It said the combination of the two companies would lead to the creation of a strong franchise in the UK with a focus on household and motor insurance."

        "published_date": "2024-02-28T16:53:43+00:00",
        "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyer said on Tuesday that a suggested 100-year prison sentence for the FTX founder would be “grotesque” and “barbaric” and at most a term of a few years behind bars would be appropriate for crimes that the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul still disputes. In pre-sentencing arguments filed just minutes before a late Tuesday deadline in Manhattan federal court, attorney Marc Mukasey said a report by probation officers improperly calculated federal sentencing guidelines to recommend a sentence just 10 years short of the maximum potential 110-year sentence. Bankman-Fried, known for his casual clothing and wild hair, was convicted of seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money in November.   Related: Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty of defrauding FTX customers out of billions   A spokesperson for prosecutors, who will respond in court papers in mid-March, declined to comment. Mukasey noted, however, that prosecutors had agreed with the 100-year recommendation and said it was supported by trial evidence. On 28 March, Judge Lewis A Kaplan will sentence the man prosecutors say cheated investors and customers of at least $10bn in businesses he controlled from 2017 through 2022. Bankman-Fried’s FTX trading platform was perceived by some in the cryptocurrency industry as a pioneer before it collapsed into bankruptcy in November 2022, weeks before he was brought to the United States from the Bahamas for trial. Mukasey wrote on Tuesday that the probation office miscalculated federal sentencing guidelines to justify its recommendation. A proper sentence, Mukasey said, would be based on guidelines that would call for between five and six and a half years in prison, at most. When Bankman-Fried’s charitable works and his commitment to others were considered, an appropriate sentence would return him “promptly to a productive role in society”, the lawyer said. Mukasey signed the 90-page document that was also worked on by four other lawyers. Mukasey said that the probation office “recommends that the Court sentence Sam to 100 years in prison. That recommendation is grotesque.” He called on the judge to reject the “barbaric proposal” for a “brilliant, complex and humane person” who does not use drugs, rarely drinks and is a first-time offender. “Sam is not the ‘evil genius’ depicted in the media or the greedy villain described at trial,” Mukasey wrote. “Sam is a 31-year-old, first-time, non-violent offender, who was joined in the conduct at issue by at least four other culpable individuals, in a matter where victims are poised to recover – were always poised to recover – a hundred cents on the dollar.” FTX was once the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, worth about $32bn in 2022, and Bankman-Fried seemed to be flying high with the purchase of Super Bowl advertising and endorsements from celebrities including the comedian Larry David and NFL superstar quarterback Tom Brady. After his arrest, though, Bankman-Fried’s communications were found by the judge to be attempts to influence trial witnesses and he was jailed before trial. For more than a half year, Bankman-Fried was permitted to live at home with his parents – both Stanford Law School professors – in Palo Alto, California, where he grew up. The judge revoked Bankman-Fried’s bail after finding it likely that he leaked the diary of the prosecution’s star witness, his former business and romantic partner Caroline Ellison, to the New York Times.   Related: Caroline Ellison’s testimony against Sam Bankman-Fried: five key takeaways   Mukasey said the media portrayal of Bankman-Fried as a luxury-laden billionaire who craved wealth was wrong and he included a quote from his client’s father, who said: “For anyone who knows Sam, the popular portrayal of him as a high-rolling, celebrity-seeking, CEO driven by greed is simply bizarre.” Mukasey also quoted Bankman-Fried’s mother, who said her son “has been racked with remorse for not having prevented the implosion of FTX and the damage that followed. It is, he has told me, the first thing he thinks about when he wakes up and the last thing he thinks about when he goes to sleep.” Mukasey wrote that Bankman-Fried “does not feel pleasure, or happiness, or joy, even when something very good happens to him”, and that he was diagnosed in college with anhedonic depression and has been on antidepressant medication ever since. Mukasey wrote that Bankman-Fried, regardless of his sentence, will never be totally free. “He will be scorned by many people wherever he goes for the rest of his life,” he said."

        "content": "  3.01pm GMT  Closing summary  Bitcoin has jumped through $60,000, rising 7.5% today, as the cryptocurrency stages its biggest monthly rally since late 2020. The surge to $60,900 means it is pushing closer to its all-time high of more than $68,000 in November 2021 – which was followed by a spectacular crash in 2022. The world’s best-known cryptocurrency has been buoyed by flows into new US spot bitcoin exchange traded products (ETFs that track the value of the cryptocurrency), which have driven its price up by around 40% in February. Our other main stories today: Thames Water has been lobbying the government and regulators to let it increase bills by 40%, pay lower fines for breaches and keep paying out dividends as part of efforts to avert a taxpayer bailout, according to a report.

We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care! – JK     2.44pm GMT  Bitcoin surges through $60,000  Bitcoin has gone through $60,000, rising 6.2% today, as the cryptocurrency stages its biggest monthly rally since late 2020. The world’s best-known cryptocurrency has been buoyed by flows into new US spot bitcoin exchange traded products (ETFs that track the value of the cryptocurrency), which have driven its price up by around 40% in February. Traders have piled into bitcoin ahead of April’s halving event, a process designed to slow the release of the cryptocurrency. Our financial editor Nils Pratley wrote last month:  Cue a fresh whoosh of demand, we are told, from US institutions and private punters who will be able to hitch themselves to the bitcoin wagon without having to go to the bother of opening a digital wallet or dealing with a crypto trading platform. The word “watershed” has been used widely to describe the moment. Giant investment names such as BlackRock will be offering these new ETFs. Ease of access and mainstream respectability have arrived as a package.    Related: Bitcoin-tracking ETFs: watershed moment or damp squib? | Nils Pratley    Updated at 2.53pm GMT    2.28pm GMT  US GDP revised slightly lower  The US economy grew at a slightly lower rate than previously thought in the final three months of last year. GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.2%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its second estimate. This was revised down from 3.3%. The bureau explained:  The update primarily reflected a downward revision to private inventory investment that was partly offset by upward revisions to state and local government spending and consumer spending.      2.25pm GMT   Panmure Gordon analyst Abid Hussain has looked at the takeover approach to Direct Line from the Belgian insurer Ageas.  Management has rejected a 233p per share offer for the group. We think the balance sheet issues have already largely been fixed following the recent disposal of the commercial business. It must now undertake the slow and hard work of fixing processes or its culture or both to react faster to inflation and other threats. The new CEO arrives at the end of the week to do just that. In the meantime, Ageas will need to revise its offer with a higher price or larger cash component or both to convince the Direct Line board and shareholders.      2.02pm GMT  Taylor Wimpey boss: 'Sometimes we don't get it right'  I’ve spoken to Taylor Wimpey boss Jennie Daly about the company’s results and the regulator’s report on the housebuilding sector, and its new investigation into eight housebuilders after it found evidence they may be sharing commercially sensitive information that could affect the price of homes, in a breach of competition law. She reiterated that the company would fully cooperate with the Competition and Markets Authority, and said the investigation was likely to last until at least the end of the year.  In its report on Monday, the CMA voiced “fundamental concerns” over the housebuilding market, pointing to the complex planning system and the limitations of speculative private development as the key reasons for the too few homes being built. Daly said:  We were very pleased with the conclusions and many of the recommendations of the market study. It will help bust some of the myths around land banking and delaying bringing development forward. It does point very strongly to the dysfunctional planning system that we have, the problems that we’re encountering around lack of predictability and the complexity of the process.  The watchdog was also critical of the quality of homes built by some developers, and that homebuyers spent weeks or months to try and get them fixed. Daly said:  We were early adopters all new homes, code and the new homes ombudsman back in 2022, and we’ve been doing a lot of work around quality. We’ve been working hard to improve our customer service and our engagement with customers… and for many, many years, we’ve been working on improving build quality, and we’ve led the industry in the measures of build quality for many years, which I’m very proud of, and we’re not done yet and we’ll continuously improve that.  Sometimes we don’t get it right, and it’s our responsibility then to properly and positively engage with our customers to ensure that that we are correcting any issues at all.      1.18pm GMT  Direct Line shares rocket as Ageas mulls £3.1bn bid  Shares in the UK insurer Direct Line rocketed after the Belgian insurer Ageas confirmed that it was considering making a takeover offer for the company. Direct Line shares jumped nearly 26% to 205.41p, valuing the company at £2.7bn, while fellow UK insurer Admiral rose 2.1%. Shares in Ageas fell 2.2% in Brussels. Ageas said that Direct Line shareholders would receive 100p in cash for each Direct Line share, and one newly issued Ageas share for every 25.24 Direct Line shares. This would value each Direct Line share at 233p, and the company at £3.1bn, Ageas said.  It said the deal would   lead to the creation of a strong personal lines franchise in the UK with key positions in Ageas’ preferred business lines of household and motor.  Earlier today, Bloomberg reported that Direct Line had rejected an approach from Ageas. Direct Line was Royal Bank of Scotland’s insurance arm, and floated on the stock market in 2012. (The selloff was demanded by the EU in return for the £45bn taxpayer bailout of RBS.) The former boss Aviva’s UK & Ireland general insurance arm, Adam Winslow, joins Direct Line as chief executive on Friday, replacing Penny James. Direct Line has struggled in recent years. James stood down in January 2023 after the company ditched its final dividend, as a big increase in weather-related claims caused a loss in underwriting. Last September, it said it would pay £30m to customers who were charged more than they should have been to renew car and home insurance policies. Its half-year loss widened to £76.3m at the time. The firm has been run by Jon Greenwood as acting CEO. Ageas, headquartered in Brussels, is one of Europe’s largest insurers and operates in Europe and Asia, with 44,000 staff and annual inflows of more than €17bn in 2023.  Updated at 1.47pm GMT    12.26pm GMT  Reckitt Benckiser shares fall 11% as sales slide  Shares in Reckitt Benckiser have fallen sharply, making it the second-biggest loser on the FTSE 100 behind the wealth manager St James’s Place, after the consumer giant reported sliding sales. Reckitt, which owns well-known brands including Nurofen, Durex condoms and Dettol disinfectant, said purchases of cold and flu remedied as well as infant formula had fallen, contributing to a drop of 1.2% in like-for-like sales in the three months to December. Profit before tax fell by 22% to £2.4m. The business was also hit by an investigation into its Middle East business. “Following investigation, we concluded a small group of employees had acted inappropriately and we are taking necessary disciplinary action,” the group said. The year before, Reckitt had benefited from a shortage of infant formula in the US. Sales at its nutrition business fell 14.3% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Reckitt had to recall some batches of Nutramigen stage 1 and stage 2 hypoallergenic formula powders in January because of the possible presence of Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria that can cause illness. The Reckitt share price dropped 11.4%. Chief executive Kris Licht described the fourth-quarter performance as “unsatisfactory”, but added:  We look to 2024 and beyond with confidence. We target another year of mid-single-digit growth in health and hygiene, driven by a more balanced contribution from price, mix and volume. We expect nutrition to return to growth late in the year.  Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said:   We had feared that the results wouldn’t be great, but we certainly hadn’t anticipated the reporting anomaly that in our view means that Reckitt’s results were really grim rather than just poor.      10.59am GMT  Bitcoin jumps to near $60,000 in biggest monthly rally since late 2020  Bitcoin has jumped for a fifth day and is trading at close to $60,000, and is on track for its biggest monthly rally since late 2020. The world’s best-known cryptocurrency has been buoyed by flows into new US spot bitcoin exchange traded products, which have driven its price up nearly 40% February. It has gained 4.5% today.

Photograph: Benoît Tessier/Reuters    Updated at 2.46pm GMT    10.48am GMT  FTSE reshuffle: easyJet to join top flight  The latest reshuffle of the FTSE will happen after 5pm today, and could see EasyJet join the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. Endeavour Mining, which owns and runs gold mines in Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Senegal, is expected to be relegated from the top flight. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown, said:   While recovering pre-pandemic form is still proving highly elusive, easyJet’s continued progress has cheered investors, with shares up 9% year to date. The ‘revenge travel’ trend is still proving strong, with people still determined to see more of the world again after being cooped up at home during the Covid crisis.  Consumers still appear to be ring-fencing chunks of disposal income to spend on airfares, seat upgrades and treats on board, with the desire to travel higher up wish-lists than home purchases like furniture and TVs. The company has shown particular prowess at selling extras to customers on flights, and that helped first quarter revenue jump 22%, with losses narrowing again. It’s also managed to largely ride out the turbulence caused by flight disruptions in the Middle East with summer bookings building well.  With signs that the UK economy may dip only briefly into a mild recession and interest rate cuts eyed on the horizon there are hopes that travellers will stay confident and keep bookings brisk.  Turning to Endeavour Mining, she said:  Endeavour Mining which has operations in West Africa is about to drop out of the big league after the company was left reeling from the abrupt departure of CEO Sébastien de Montessus. He was fired for serious misconduct in January for making an irregular payment instruction for $5.9m, in relation to an asset disposal.  Although he was replaced by deputy chair Ian Cockerill pretty swiftly, confidence has still been shaken in the gold miner, which operates in West Africa. Shares have fallen almost 30% year to date. It hasn’t helped that costs came in higher than expected at the last count, even though the company met output targets.  The HS2 contractor Kier Group is set to be promoted from the FTSE Small Cap index to the FTSE-250, while Tullow Oil, an oil and gas explorer founded in Tullow in Ireland, but headquartered in London, is likely to be ejected from the FTSE-250 as operational problems persist. Its shares have fallen 35% so far this year, pushing it into the relegation zone. Streeter said:  Enthusiasm has risen for construction company Kier Group as it unveiled a robust order book and showed strength in dealing with supply chain challenges and inflationary costs. It’s staging a turnaround, and now appears back on track after a highly difficult period when it appeared to be on the brink of bankruptcy and was hit hard by the pandemic. Winning HS2 contracts saved the company from collapse and now its restructuring plan is bearing considerable fruit with balance sheet rebuilding underway. it is considered to be well placed to continue to benefit from UK government infrastructure spending. Tullow Oil has been affected by operational and financial challenges over recent years and here had been hopes that prospects were looking up with rising production at its Jubilee field, offshore Ghana, with five wells expected to come on stream in 2024. However, it’s been beset by further difficulties after it was forced to stop work on its Kenyan oil fields and its trucking operations due to security issues, adding to fresh investor caution about its resilience.      10.34am GMT   Cat Hobbs, director of the public ownership campaign group We Own It, said about Thames Water – which is lobbying the government to let it increase bills by 40%, pay dividends to shareholders and face lower fines, as it tries to avoid a financial failure:  It’s never been more obvious that water privatisation has failed. It beggars belief that Thames Water, a company that has paid billions out in dividends while underinvesting in infrastructure, neglecting their duty to prevent sewage spills, and racking up eye-watering debts, is asking for even more freedom from the regulator. As Thames Water circles the drain, the public are wising up to the failed experiment of water privatisation. Seven in 10 of us want water to be in public ownership. Almost nowhere else in the world runs water the way we do. It’s time to bring water into public ownership with no bailout at the public’s expense.   Updated at 10.35am GMT    10.24am GMT  HMRC struggling to cope as customer service levels hit ‘all-time low’  Customer service levels at HM Revenue and Customs have sunk to an “all-time low”, parliament’s spending watchdog has said. Users regularly encounter long call-waiting times as the tax department apparently struggles to cope with demand, a report by the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) has found. As demands on HMRC grow, the authority has not been given the resources needed to staff its phone lines, the report said. In 2022-23, 62% of callers waited more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser – up from 46% the previous year. On average, it took a little more than 16 minutes for someone to answer the phone – up from a little more than 12 minutes in 2021–22. However, in December there were reports of some callers facing waits of up to an hour to get through, with some people saying they ended up being cut off before their call was even answered. The tax office is trying to cope by weaning service users off speaking to a real person on the phone in favour of having them make do with YouTube videos and chatbots, the report found.

Virgin Media and O2, which merged in 2021, are scheduled to go ahead with price rises of up to 8.8% this April – the latest retail prices index figure of 4.9%, plus an extra 3.9%. These increases, which come on top of 17% rises a year ago, are the highest increases in percentage terms out of any of the large broadband or mobile firms this year. Virgin broadband customers will typically see their bills rise by just above £39 a year from April, according to Which?. Customers who do not want to be hit with this price rise face exit fees of as much as £404 if they were to leave their contract 12 months early, it said.

Amid a financial crisis hitting town halls across England, councillors in Southwark have resorted to a crowdfunding scheme to raise £6m over the next six years to help fund climate-friendly projects. In a creative response to the double challenge of financial constraints and maintaining investment required to tackle the climate emergency, the scheme plans to raise £1m for the coming financial year with the offer of a 4.6% return for investors. An overwhelming majority of English local authorities are planning deep cuts to services and maximum possible council tax rises to remain financially solvent, despite an extra £600m cash injection from the government.

Shell plc is preparing to divest from the delta but a report warns that it must remain until it has cleaned up its legacy of pollution. The report, by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (Somo), says historical pollution remains a serious issue in the area and accuses Shell of trying to avoid responsibility despite the billions of dollars it has earned from the oil. The allegations come as the Labour MP Clive Lewis said in the House of Commons that the departure of Shell, a British company, from the delta raised serious concerns that its environmental responsibilities and obligations could be evaded.

The firm said it has experienced a “marked increase” in clients registering complaints about the service they have received in the past. Mark FitzPatrick, the chief executive, said:  We recognise that this is a disappointing outcome for everyone… We switched off ongoing servicing charges for 2% of clients where there was a lack of evidence that ongoing servicing was provided in this period.  The provision pushed the firm to a loss after tax of £9.9m, compared with a £407m profit in 2022. St James’s is a well-known name, and offers clients services ranging from wealth management to retirement planning. However, it has struggled in the past year. In October, it bowed to pressure from regulators and announced a revamp of its fees, regarded as opaque and expensive, including scrapping penalties for customers pulling their money within a certain period.  Simplifying the fee structure will be completed by the second half of next year, and it will make it “much easier to compare investment performance across the industry on a like-for-like basis”. The new fee structure will have an impact on profits, FitzPatrick warned, and prompted the company to reduce payouts to shareholders. It slashed its final dividend to 8p a share from 37.19p. This means investors will get a total payout of 23.83p, less than half of the previous year. In the next three years, annual dividends will be set at 18p per share, plus share buybacks. The CEO said:  A combination of the provision we have established and an expected decrease in the level of profit growth in the next few years as we transition to our new charging structure, reduces our ability to invest for long term growth in our business over the next few years.   Updated at 10.12am GMT    9.44am GMT   Thames Water, which serves more than 15m households, has amassed a debt pile of £14bn, and been fined repeatedly over sewage dumping.  It also expects to leak more water than previously thought, after its ageing pipes were overwhelmed by a deluge of rainfall. Britain’s largest water company has told regulators it now expects to leak 585m litres a day this financial year, up from a previous forecast of 550m litres a day. Last week, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) updated 30-year-old legislation on the special administration regime, which would allow existing shareholders to retain a stake in the company and make it less likely that failing water companies could be fully renationalised. Here is our take on the FT story:   Related: Thames Water lobbying government to let it increase bills by 40%   In December, the parent company of Thames Water, Kemble Water Holdings, was told by auditors that it could run out of cash by April if shareholders did not inject more funds into the company. The company has raised £500m and says shareholders would inject more than £3bn more – but this would be dependent on Thames Water getting what it wants from the regulator. A crucial part of this is getting permission to issue dividends to services its debt. However, new rules introduced by the government last year can take enforcement action against water companies issuing dividends if they are performing badly against financial and environmental targets. Thames Water has said investors will not take any money out of the business until the turnaround is completed but the rules do not distinguish between internal and external dividends.     8.58am GMT   Last week, the chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, Sir Robert Goodwill, wrote to the Ofwat chief executive David Black to urge him to ensure water companies clean up their act before bills rise. The committee recommended that any forward programme “must clearly set out how Ofwat will balance its need to regulate with protecting the financial viability of the water companies”. Stating that many Ofwat investigations into malpractice in the water sector take several years to complete, undermining public trust in the sector, Goodwill also urged the regulator to give details as to how it will complete investigations in a more timely manner. With regard to household water bills, the letter emphasised the importance of the effects on consumers of proposals to raise water bills in order to finance the essential investment in new infrastructure. The committee noted that this investment has for many years been “neglected in favour of profit and dividends to shareholders”. Goodwill wrote that  an increase in bills will produce a justifiable perception of unfairness from consumers who are being asked to shoulder the burden of improvements by companies who have consistently and publicly failed on delivering their core obligations.   Updated at 9.05am GMT    8.36am GMT   Returning to our main story, Thames Water, the Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson and MP for Richmond Park, Sarah Olney, said:  This week the government told me they won’t make their contingency plan in the event of Thames Water’s collapse public. This is a cover up. Customers and taxpayers deserve to know what ministers plan to do if this disastrous situation happens.      8.34am GMT  Halfords blames weather and bike promotions for profit drop  The bike and car parts retailer Halfords has warned of a sharp fall in profits, blaming “unusually mild and very wet weather” for lower footfall, and reduced sales of winter tyres and car cleaning products. It said the cycling market has become more challenging and competitive, with more promotions, and more customers buying on credit, leading to weaker profit margins. Its shared were hammered after the profit warning, plummeting nearly 24%. Halfords now expects profits before tax to fall to £35m to £40m, a downgrade of at least 17%, for the year to the end of March. It assumes the market will stay tough for the rest of its fourth quarter, including the peak Easter cycling period in March. In January, the firm had estimated profits of between £48m and £53m.     8.25am GMT   Here is our full story on Tata’s new £4bn gigafactory in Bridgend, which will bring about 4,000 jobs to the region.   Related: Tata confirms Somerset will be home to £4bn battery factory       8.13am GMT  Taylor Wimpey to build fewer houses this year  Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, said it will build fewer homes this year as the housing market remains fairly weak, as it posted a 49% slump in annual profits. The company said the market stabilised at the start of this year as mortgage rates eased, but a delay in the first interest rate cut and concerns over the economy have tempered hopes of a quick recovery. Jennie Daly, the chief executive, said:  It is still early in the year and the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, however it is encouraging to see some signs of improvement in the market, with reduced mortgage rates positively impacting affordability and customer confidence.  Revenues fell 20.5% to £3.5bn last year, while profit before tax and one-off items almost halved to £473.8m. Taylor Wimpey completed 10,848 homes last year, versus 14,154 in 2022. Average selling prices on private homes rose 5.1 to £370,000. It expects to build between 9,500 and 10,000 homes this year. The firm said it welcomed the Competition and Market Authority’s final report, published on Monday, from its housebuilding market study “with its focus on improving the planning system, adoption of amenities and outcomes for house buyers”. Taylor Wimpey said it would “cooperate fully” with the regulator’s new investigation. The CMA opened an investigation into eight housebuilders, including Taylor Wimpey, after it found evidence they may be sharing commercially sensitive information that could affect the price of homes, such as sales prices and details of incentives for buyers.   Related:  UK housebuilders investigated over possible sharing of price information   The report concluded that it had “fundamental concerns” over the housebuilding market, pointing to the complex planning system and the limitations of speculative private development as the key reasons for the too few homes being built. The government set a target of building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s in its 2019 manifesto but only 250,000 were built last year, with many in the sector warning that this is likely to shrink considerably this year. The CMA found that profits of the 11 largest housebuilders were “generally higher than we would expect for a well-functioning market”. However, it also warned that any measures introduced to tackle profitability in the sector would reduce the number of homes being built and exacerbate supply problems. The report was also critical of the quality of homes built by some developers.  Updated at 8.17am GMT    7.58am GMT  Aston Martin 2023 loss shrinks due to higher prices  The luxury carmaker Aston Martin said its annual loss narrowed more than expected because it raised its prices to record levels. It launched the DB12, an open-top model, last year, with prices starting at $248,086. However, it has pushed back plans to launch its first battery-powered electric vehicle by a year to 2026. The company reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of £171.8m for 2023, compared with £451m the year before. Analysts had forecast a loss of £209m. Aston Martin said it was on track to hit its longstanding target of a 40% gross profit margin this year.  Updated at 11.33am GMT    7.47am GMT   In other corporate news, mobile phone giant Vodafone has confirmed it is in exclusive talks to sell its Italian business to Switzerland’s Swisscom in a deal worth €8bn (£6.8bn). The company said:  Vodafone has engaged extensively with several parties to explore market consolidation in Italy and believes this potential transaction delivers the best combination of value creation, upfront cash proceeds and transaction certainty for Vodafone shareholders.       7.41am GMT  Introduction: Thames Water is lobbying for higher bills and lower fines to avoid bailout, report claims  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling of business, the financial markets, and the world economy.Thames Water is lobbying the government and industry regulator Ofwat to let it increase household bills by 40% by 2030, pay dividends to shareholders and receive lower fines as it seeks to stave off a potential multibillion-pound taxpayer bailout, the Financial Times reported. Britain’s largest water company is desperately trying to avoid being taken over under the government’s special administration regime. Last week the government passed updated water insolvency legislation, suggesting the company could be moving closer to a collapse. Officials at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have drawn up contingency plans for the company’s failure, worried that about the consequences if the company collapsed, as it supplies water and sewage services to a quarter of England’s population. The FT said the secret plan to save the firm is called “Project Timber”. Ministers hope that Ofwat will allow “regulatory easements” such as reduced fines to reduce the financial pressure on the company, the paper reported. The current situation was described by one insider as “like a flooded room with only an inch of air at the top”. He added: “The shareholders would be irrational to put any equity in if they don’t win concessions.” Europe’s largest electrical vehicle battery factory will be built in Bridgewater, Somerset, its Indian owner Tata Group has confirmed. Construction is to begin immediately, and the factory is expected to start producing batteries in 2026. Tata decided to locate the 4bn facility, which is backed by £500m of government funding, at the 620-acre Gravity Smart Campus. It is the site of a former Royal Ordnance factory that made bombs during World War Two. The factory will make batteries for Tata Motors and JLR, formerly Jaguar Land Rover, before later expanding to produce cells for commercial vehicles, two-wheelers and energy storage solutions.

        "content": "The UK government is understood to be in talks with brokers including AJ Bell and Hargreaves Lansdown to help it market shares in NatWest to retail investors as it explores possible options for selling down its stake in the bank. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said in his autumn statement last November that the government would “explore options” for selling down its remaining stake in the British banking group – now at just below 33% – and would plan to invite the public to buy shares. The government has opened early talks with a number of brokers about helping to sell the shares to retail investors and has asked firms to sign non-disclosure agreements, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the development. The Treasury declined to comment. In November, the chancellor said he would look at options for a retail share offer within 12 months, although it would be “subject to supportive market conditions and achieving value for money”. In his speech, Hunt referred to the mass privatisations of the 1980s – when shares in British Gas were advertised to members of the public with the slogan “If you see Sid … tell him”. He told MPs: “It’s time to get Sid investing again.” Speculation is growing that Hunt will use next week’s budget to announce further details of a share sale to the public, which UK Government Investments said earlier this month could come as early as June. In a retail offering, shares would be offered to members of the public as opposed to solely to institutional investors. The chancellor told parliament last November that the NatWest retail share offer was part of further capital market reforms aimed at keeping the UK as an attractive centre to start and list a company. The government’s holding in NatWest is now worth approximately £6.8bn, but any retail share sale is expected to be for only part of the stake.  The government has part-owned NatWest since the 2008 financial crisis when it took an 84% stake in the then Royal Bank of Scotland group to bail out the bank but it has since steadily sold down its stake. Shares in NatWest rose 1% in early trading on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the bank reported its biggest annual profit since the financial crisis, helped by rising interest rates, with its pre-tax profits rising by 20% to £6.2bn in the year to December 2023. The bank also confirmed Paul Thwaite would become NatWest chief executive after his predecessor Alison Rose was forced to step down last July after a de-banking row with the politician Nigel Farage. Tim Jacobs, the head of primary markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “NatWest has generated strong interest from clients and we’d expect this to grow rapidly over the next couple of months. “Given that people can already buy NatWest in the secondary market, the discount offered in the share sale is going to be a major factor in how well the offer gets away.” AJ Bell was contacted but declined to comment."

        "content": "In Hollywood everyone knows never to ask for a percentage of the film profits. These so-called “monkey points” are the stuff of legends and mirth. Anyone silly enough to demand a slice of profits will be waiting by the letterbox for a cheque that will never come. Famously Forrest Gump never turned a profit, which is quite the achievement for a film that cost $55m to make and earned $678m worldwide. Given how we tax our gas industry, you get the feeling our gas companies love the way Hollywood does business, and the government has not worked out that they’re the silly ones waiting for a cheque that will never arrive. Were we to tax gas appropriately we would have a much better chance to properly fund new policies such as those in the universities accord final report released on the weekend. Australia produces more than six times the amount of gas needed to supply our manufacturing industry, power stations and homes. But more than 80% either heads overseas as LNG exports or is used to convert natural gas into LNG:    If the graph does not display click here We export a stonkingly large amount – and much more than we used to. In the 2000s we exported around 14m tonnes of LNG a year. Now, due to the opening of the Gladstone LNG terminal, we send 83mt overseas – the second most of any nation. More production equals more revenue thus surely more profit (even if the margins remain the same) and thus more tax – after all, why would companies massively increase production if not to make more money? Given we have a mining tax for the gas industry called the petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT), the government surely is swimming in a money bin of gas tax revenue. Alas no:    If the graph does not display click here When Australia exported 15.4mt of LNG in 2008-09, the government raised $2.2bn in PRRT. In 2022-23, exports had increased 437% to 83mt but PRRT revenue was up just 7% to $2.4bn. It would appear that gas suddenly became unprofitable.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  At this point the corporate shills will scream that you don’t get taxed on revenue or production but profits. That is both obvious and true but it was also obvious and true that before 2015, when the Gladstone terminal opened, there was a very strong correlation between gas industry revenue and gas industry taxes:    If the graph does not display click here The same went for production and tax:    If the graph does not display click here Were the companies stupid to start exporting LNG from Gladstone as it seems their profit margins have all but disappeared?    If the graph does not display click here Had the relationship between revenue and tax paid stayed the same as in the decade before the Gladstone terminal opened, the gas industry would have paid $14bn more tax in 2020-21 and $58bn more in the seven years after 2014-15. The gas industry pays less tax per barrel of gas produced now than any time going back 35 years. Who would have thought producing so much gas would destroy their profits.    If the graph does not display click here The problem is the PRRT is a tax lawyers’ picnic – they can use costs to defray their liabilities for as long as they like. In 2021 the ATO told the Senate that Shell expected it would never pay PRRT on its 25% share of the $55bn Gorgon project. Never. Not one dollar. We tax our massive gas exports so weakly that, as the head of the Australia Institute, (whom I work for), Richard Denniss, noted to the National Press Club, Australians pay more each year in Hecs/Help debt than gas companies do in PRRT:    If the graph does not display click here In last year’s budget, the government finally proposed limiting the deductions to the PRRT in any year to 90% of LNG project revenues. Alas that proposal also had a punchline. The government announced the changes would raise an extra $2.4bn in PRRT over the next four years. That was roughly a 30% increase in tax. Thirty per cent!   Related: When it comes to tax, what is bracket creep – and is ‘fixing’ it really that important? | Greg Jericho   You would think the gas industry would launch the mother of all campaigns against it. But no. They loved it. The day it was announced the gas industry peak body recommended bipartisan support as the changes “would see more revenue collected earlier”. The key word was “earlier”. It won’t raise more tax; it just moves some tax from later to earlier. But it won’t even do that. In December’s midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), the government announced it was revising down its estimate of how much PRRT would be raised over the next four years. How much did it reduce its estimate by? You guessed it: $2.4bn:    If the graph does not display click here That’s despite the Treasury also estimating higher gas prices. No wonder the gas companies love the changes. We have rising levels of student debt, declining public school infrastructure and facilities and a desperate need for better tertiary education all the while apparently being the second biggest exporter of gas in the world. For too long governments have been content to be monkeys playing the fool for the gas companies. That needs to change. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

        "content": "Halfords shares have plunged by almost a quarter after it issued an unscheduled profit warning, in part because of more consumers buying bicycles on credit. The motoring and cycling retailer said it expected to post profits of between £35m and £40m for the year up to this April, well down on its initial forecast of between £48m and £53m. In a trading update to the market on Wednesday, it said the profit warning was driven partly by an overall fall in the current cycling market, which saw an 8% drop in sales in January compared with the previous year. The retailer said the fall was driven partly by more people wanting to buy bicycles on credit, which was leading to weaker gross margins than expected. The cycling market had become more “challenging and competitive” as the sector continued to consolidate, the company said, leading to consumers picking up cheaper bikes through an increasing number of discount promotions and clearance sales at its stores. Halfords’ cycling and retail motoring divisions were also hit by generally weak customer confidence and “unusually mild but very wet weather”, which led to weaker sales in car cleaning and winter products. Overall retail motoring markets were down by 5.1% in January, compared with last year, while consumer tyres markets had declined by 4.3%. Halfords shares fell by 23% in early trading. The profit warning was the second issued by Halfords in two years, after the company revealed in January 2023 that it expected to make profits of £60m, down from the £75m first envisaged. The company had blamed difficulties in hiring enough mechanics to keep up with demand. The falling sales in Halfords’ bicycle division come only a few years after it had to raise its profit forecasts twice in a month during 2020, when it reported a 46% increase in bicycle sales during the Covid-19 sales boom. It said on Wednesday: “Looking ahead to FY25, we remain cautious on market recovery in the short-term, and the current significant volatility in market conditions means that forecasting accurately is challenging. “While we have reduced our profit guidance as a result of very challenging and exceptional short-term market conditions, we remain confident in our strategy and longer-term growth prospects.” • This article was amended on 29 February 2024. An earlier version attributed some figures for the fall in sales on last year to Halfords specifically, rather than to the wider market."

        "content": "Deep cuts to government funding have led a council in south London to ask its residents to invest their own money, for a financial return, to build cycle hangars, LED street lighting and green upgrades at schools and leisure centres. Amid a financial crisis hitting town halls across England, councillors in Southwark have resorted to a crowdfunding scheme to raise £6m over the next six years to help fund climate-friendly projects. In a creative response to the double challenge of financial constraints and maintaining investment required to tackle the climate emergency, the scheme plans to raise £1m for the coming financial year with the offer of a 4.6% return for investors. An overwhelming majority of English local authorities are planning deep cuts to services and maximum possible council tax rises to remain financially solvent, despite an extra £600m cash injection from the government. “Certainly that’s the context,” said Emily Hickson, the Labour-run council’s deputy cabinet member for green finance. “Southwark is not different to any other council in the country: we’re all struggling with the lack of central government grants and keeping up with inflation. “We are in the black and that’s because we are being innovative.” The scheme allows investments of as little as £5, and had raised more than £50,000 within hours of its launch on Tuesday. It is open to individuals and businesses regardless of residency, with a fixed return of 4.6% a year over a five-year term. Potential investors are warned, however, that their capital is at risk and they may lose some or even all of the money they put in. Figures from the Local Government Association on Wednesday show two-thirds of English councils are planning cuts to neighbourhood services this year – such as waste collection, road repairs, library and leisure services – as they struggle to plug funding gaps. As years of underfunding from central government collide with higher inflation and rising demand on services, it estimates councils are facing a £4bn shortfall over the two financial years to 2024-25. It warned that 85% of councils were planning to make cost savings to balance their budgets for the coming financial year. Southwark council said this month it needed to find savings and efficiencies to close a budget gap of £6.7m for the coming financial year amid rising pressure on services and increasing costs. It is also planning a maximum allowed council tax increase of 4.99%. Since 2010, the council has lost government funding in cash terms of more than £146m. Earlier this month, Southwark came under fire for tearing out communal spaces and children’s playgrounds to make room for new homes, which were then left boarded up when the council ran out of money. The local authority’s crowdfunding scheme will be managed by Abundance Investment, a financial platform focused on ethical and sustainable community investment projects that is managing more and more programmes on behalf of English local authorities. After launching its first in 2020 for Warrington council in Cheshire, nine local authorities have launched crowdfunding drives using the platform to meet climate targets, including West Berkshire, Camden and Cotswold district council. Hickson said the Southwark scheme would involve a cheaper interest rate for the local authority than borrowing through the government’s public works loan board, which offers councils cheap long-term loans to finance local projects. It would also have the benefit of engaging residents directly with the council’s climate emergency plans. “It’s pretty small. It’s not the way councils around the country are going to solve their budget crises,” Hickson said. “It should enable us to do this on an accelerated time span. These types of projects do need to happen.”"

        "content": "Thames Water has been lobbying the government and regulators to let it increase bills by 40%, pay lower fines for breaches and keep paying out dividends as part of efforts to avert a taxpayer bailout, according to a report. The UK’s largest water company was trying to strike a deal with the watchdog Ofwat that would give it permission to charge customers more to avoid having to be taken over by court-appointed special administrators, the Financial Times reported. That plan would give Thames Water permission to increase bills by 40% by 2030, while also offering more leniency around regulator fines and rules around the dividends it can pay to shareholders. It comes as the company, which serves more than 15m households, attempts to deal with a debt pile of £14bn and widespread criticism over sewage dumping. If the government or Ofwat felt that Thames Water was unable to pay its debts it could apply to the high court to invoke the special administration process, in which administrators would be brought in to help manage the company. Last week, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) updated 30-year-old legislation on the special administration regime, which would allow existing shareholders to retain a stake in the company and make it less likely that failing water companies could be fully renationalised. According to the FT, officials at Defra have in place contingency plans for Thames Water if it collapses, under the name Project Timber. As part of this, it hopes Ofwat would allow “regulatory easements” on the issuing of hefty fines, which would put further pressure on the company. In December, the parent company of Thames Water, Kemble Water Holdings, was told by auditors that it could run out of cash by April if shareholders did not inject more funds into the company. The company has raised £500m and says shareholders would inject more than £3bn more – but this would be dependent on Thames Water getting what it wants from the regulator. A crucial part of this is getting permission to issue dividends to services its debt. However, new rules introduced by the government last year can take enforcement action against water companies issuing dividends if they are performing badly against financial and environmental targets. Thames Water has said investors will not take any money out of the business until the turnaround is completed but the rules do not distinguish between internal and external dividends. Thames Water revealed this month that it expected more leaks than initially thought, after its ageing pipes were overwhelmed by heavy rain this winter. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Ofwat does not comment on speculation. Thames Water needs to continue to deliver on its turnaround plan to improve its operational and environmental performance. It is for the company to secure shareholder backing to improve its financial resilience. We will continue to closely monitor the company’s progress as they do so to protect customers’ interests.” A government spokesperson said: “Water companies are commercial entities and we do not comment on the financial situation of specific companies as it would not be appropriate. “We prepare for a range of scenarios across our regulated industries – including water – as any responsible government would.” Thames Water declined to comment."

        "content": "Inflation remained flat in January at a two-year low, helped by falling prices for meat and seafood, stoking hopes the Reserve Bank may bring forward interest rate cuts. The consumer price index in January was 3.4%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists predicted CPI would increase to 3.6% from December’s 3.4%. Food and non-alcoholic beverages reported a pick up in annual inflation to 4.4% last month from 4% in December. Meat and seafood prices, though, were down 2% from a year earlier compared with a 1.9% drop in December.  Interactive  Government intervention also helped reduce some of the price increases. Electricity prices, for instance, were 0.8% higher than a year ago in January, with rebates moderating the rise. “Excluding the rebates, electricity prices would have increased 15.3% in the 12 months to January 2024,” said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. Rents continued to post large increases. The 7.4% rise in rental costs from January 2023 matched the rise reported for December, with vacancy rates remaining at or near historically low levels in some capitals. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said rents “would have risen 9.1% without our boost to Commonwealth Rent Assistance”. “The direction of travel is clear: inflation is moderating helped by the Albanese government’s cost-of-living policies,” Chalmers said. “Inflation is moderating in encouraging ways but we know it’s not mission accomplished because people are still under the pump.” Monthly CPI figures can be more volatile than quarterly ones because the ABS surveys only part of the basket of goods and services. Still, they provide a snapshot of inflationary pressures in the economy. The Reserve Bank wants to be sure inflation remains on course to return to within its target range of 2%-3% by next year and to about 2.5% by 2026. It raised its cash rate 13 times between May 2022 and November 2023 to a 12-year high of 4.35%. It noted in the minutes from its February board meeting that goods price inflation “had declined more than expected”. However, services inflation “remained high and was still expected to decline only gradually”. Prior to the CPI release investors estimated the chance of a cut in the RBA’s key interest rate was about 5% when the board next meets on 18-19 March, according to the ASX’s rates tracker. After a review of the central bank’s operations released last year, the RBA board will now only meeting eight times a year instead of 11. Markets were little moved in the wake of today’s CPI figures, with the Australian dollar hovering near 65.5 US cents and the stock market holding its losses for the day of about 0.1%. David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares, said “Australia’s broad disinflationary trend remained intact during January with another lower-than-expected inflation result”. “All up, today’s CPI release should be broadly reassuring to the RBA and, on balance, reduces the risk it might consider yet another rate increases in coming months,” Bassanese said, adding the numbers reinforced his view that the central bank would be able to cut interest rates at least twice in the final months of 2024. Besa Deda, chief economist for Westpac’s business division, said the January CPI figure means the commercial bank’s quarterly CPI forecast of 0.7% may have to be revised lower. “We think the rate-hiking cycle has ended and today’s result is further evidence of that,” Deda said. “We continue to expect that cuts are still a second-half 2024 story because the RBA has suggested it wishes to be convinced of further progress being made on inflation.” As households change their spending habits over the years, the ABS has to adjust the weighting given to each category to estimate how much overall prices are changing in the economy. On Wednesday, the ABS updated the basket of goods and services, bringing some of the weightings closer to pre-Covid levels.  Meanwhile the ABS has revised the basket of goods and services they use to derive the inflation numbers. Weightings are returning to pre-Covid levels with a greater share for savings and a smaller one for goods. (Source: @absstat) pic.twitter.com/oXj3qpZEHs— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) February 28, 2024  During the pandemic lockdowns, households spent more on appliances, furniture and other equipment, including computers, and much less on travel and restaurants. The share of goods reached 58% of the CPI index at one point, and just 42% on services. The 2024 update has revised the share to 54.5% for goods and 45.5% for services, a move that “reflects spending patterns closer to the pre-Covid-19 period”, the ABS said. The recreation and culture group category has seen a big adjustment, rising 1.71 percentage points in the rejig. The fact more Australians headed overseas and with international airfare prices remaining elevated, the weighting of this sub-category increased 0.92pp. Overseas arrivals and departures are now back to about 90% of pre-Covid levels, the ABS said. In January’s figures alone, holiday travel and accommodation was 7.1% cheaper than a year earlier, not far off the 9.1% year-on-year drop reported in December. After the 2024 CPI weighting update, housing remained the largest category, accounting for 21.74% of the overall index. That was half a percentage point lower than for last year, dragged down by fewer people buying new homes. Food and non-alcoholic beverages, with a weighting of 17.15%, were little changed from the 2023 index. Recreation and culture at 12.55% leapfrogged transport’s 11.42% to contribute the third largest weighting within the CPI index."

        "content": "Travelling by train on Britain’s busiest business routes generates less than half the carbon emissions of a battery electric car, according to detailed analysis from the rail industry. Certain journeys on the greenest, fullest electric trains produce as little as one-fifteenth of the CO2 per person compared with the footprint of a sole occupancy petrol or diesel car, the data shows. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) claimed the data is the industry’s most accurate and granular yet, incorporating train types and occupancy, and said it hopes it will allow businesses to make the greenest travel choices. However, campaigners pointed out that fares on some of the comparatively greenest rail routes were not cheaper than cars, and the cost of rail travel needed to be addressed. The RDG said that on average across the top 100 business travel routes, using a diesel or petrol car produced nine times more carbon than going by train. The figure was four times more polluting than a train if driving a plug-in hybrid electric car, or almost two-and-a-half times more if using a battery electric car. The comparison uses the government’s official figures for average executive car emissions by distance. Battery EV emissions largely depend on the source of electricity, and should decrease with the uptake of renewable energy. Going from Edinburgh to London Kings Cross would emit 116kg of CO2 in a diesel car, 31.8kg in a battery car and 12.7kg per person by train, according to the RDG data. However, single fares on the main operator on that route, LNER, are now £183 without pre-booking, although much cheaper advance fares are available.  Average fuel costs would be roughly £50 for a small petrol car to travel the 400 miles, and significantly less again for an electric car, even after recent energy price rises. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the RDG, said the data would allow businesses to have the most accurate measure of emissions for the 100 most popular business rail journeys. She said: “We all have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, and the data that we have published reveals that rail is the green choice for travel between our towns and cities.” Business travel on rail has slipped substantially since the pandemic, accelerating moves towards online meetings and video conferencing. Rail fares are due to rise by 4.9% across England from Sunday. Michael Solomon Williams, from charity Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Travelling by train is always greener than driving, and it’s getting even greener as more rail routes are electrified.  “It is often quicker too, but what we now need to do is to ensure it is also cheaper. Next week’s rail fare rise will do little to address the rising cost of rail travel. He added: “Businesses can also do their bit to reduce transport emissions by having a ‘rail first’ travel policy and encouraging employees to take the train when travelling with work.”"

Ramsden told a Q&A session, after delivering a speech to the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, that he wants to see more evidence that inflationary pressures are easing. That’s been a familiar refrain from BoE policymakers recently, after they left rates on hold at 5.25% earlier this month.     3.12pm GMT  US recession fears as consumer confidence drops  Just in: US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has fallen to February to 106.7, down from 110.9 in January, ending a three-month run of gains. The Present Situation Index – based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions – fell to 147.2 from 154.9 in January.  The Expectations Index – based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions – slipped to 79.8 from 81.5 in January. An Expectations Index reading below 80 often signals recession ahead, the Conference Board says.  “The decline in consumer confidence in February interrupted a three-month rise, reflecting persistent uncertainty about the US economy,Confidence deteriorated for consumers under the age of 35 and those 55 and over, whereas it improved slightly for those aged 35 to 54.”… pic.twitter.com/aY2aeMNiOC— Mike Zaccardi, CFA, CMT 🍖 (@MikeZaccardi) February 27, 2024  Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, says the drop in consumer confidence reflects “persistent uncertainty about the US economy,” adding:  “The drop in confidence was broad-based, affecting all income groups except households earning less than $15,000 and those earning more than $125,000.

The business said it would shutter about 50 outlets by the end of 2024 after issuing a muted trading outlook for the year ahead. As part of what it calls a “bold new chapter”, the retailer – which in January announced plans to cut 2,350 jobs, or 3.5% of its workforce – said it would concentrate more on luxury shopping. As part of this focus, Macy’s plans to open 15 of its higher-end Bloomingdale’s stores, and 30 Blue Mercury cosmetics locations. “A bold new chapter serves as a strong call to action,” Tony Spring, the new chief executive officer of Macy’s, said.   “It challenges the status quo to create a more modern Macy’s, Inc.”    Related: Macy’s to shutter 150 stores amid focus on luxury       2.37pm GMT    DOW JONES DOWN 38.84 POINTS, OR 0.10 PERCENT, AT 39,030.39 AFTER MARKET OPENNASDAQ  UP 36.96 POINTS, OR 0.23 PERCENT, AT 16,013.21 AFTER MARKET OPENS&P 500 UP 4.31 POINTS, OR 0.09 PERCENT, AT 5,073.84 AFTER MARKET OPEN— First Squawk (@FirstSquawk) February 27, 2024      2.30pm GMT   In the bond market, UK 10-year gilt yields have hit their highest level of the year today. 10-year bond yields are up four basis points (a small move) at 4.18%, the highest since the first week of December. Bond yields rise when bond prices fall, and measures the cost of government borrowing. At the end of last year, 10-year gilts were yielding 3.4%, having hit 4.5% in the panic after the mini-budget of autumn 2022. But they have been rising in 2024, as the financial markets have trimmed their forecasts for interest rate cuts. And that has eaten into the amount of headroom the chancellor has to cut taxes and still point to debt falling within five years.

Nigeria’s central bank has decided to lift its benchmark interest rate by four percentage points, to 22.75% from 18.75%, a larger increase than expected. The hike comes a couple of weeks after Nigeria’s naira dropped to a record low, after being devalued at the start of February.     12.47pm GMT  Hedge Fund Founder: UK's migration curbs pose risk to economy  A leading UK entrepreneur has warned that the government’s migration crackdown risks damaging UK higher education institutions, and could set back the country’s ambitions to be a leader in science and technology. Ewan Kirk, founder of quantitative hedge fund Cantab Capital Partners, told Bloomberg that making the UK less attractive for overseas students will lead to a university funding shortfall and a reduced pool of talent for British employers. Thiw would undermine the government’s efforts to make the UK the next Silicon Valley. More here: Hedge Fund Founder Says UK Migration Curbs Pose Risk to Economy.

Sky News reports that Elliott Advisors has improved its existing bid for Currys, slightly. Elliott’s revised proposal valued Currys at between 65p and 70p-a-share, compared with an initial 62p-a-share bid worth £700m, they say. More here.

This system, introduced by chancellor George Osborne in 2012, is criticised – as it doesn’t capture a household’s income (two parents earning £49,999 each would qualify for full payments, while one on £60,000 would lose the lot). Paul Johnson says it’s not impossible that someone could still be entitled to universal credit despite earning £50,000 [due to recent changes in eligibility]. Carl Emmerson suggest that a “rational” system would say either that a) child benefit should be universal, or b) that it should be abolished, and the money used to make the child top-up payment in universal credit more generous. The latter option could provide a means-tested system, which isn’t currently the case. Incidentally, the Financial Times reports this morning that Jeremy Hunt is under growing Conservative pressure to reform child benefit and remove “one of the UK’s most notorious tax cliff edges”. However, the chancellor’s allies said Budget measures on this issue were “unlikely at this stage” but had not been ruled out.  Updated at 11.58am GMT    11.34am GMT   Q: Why is the UK’s GDP-per-capita perforrming worse than straight GDP growth, if we think immigration should push up GDP-per-capita? IFS director Paul Johnson says we don’t necessarily think immigration will push up GDP-per-capita, although it will clearly increase national income. It depends who is coming over to the UK, and what jobs they are going into, Johnson explains. The current inflow of people is very bimodal, Johnson adds, with a lot of high-income, high-skill people, and also a lot at the bottom of the earnings distribution. Reminder: UK GDP per capita hasn’t grown for the last seven quarters, a record-breakingly bad run of weak living standards.  Two quarters of contraction of real GDP will get headlines, but maybe this is the real story 👇💥 GDP per person dropped every quarter of 2023.

IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson says stronger private sector wage growth would create more pressure to raise public sector pay. That extra cash in the economy, if it’s not associated with increased productivity, is inflation – if people are being paid more to produce the same as before. That could prompt the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer, Emmerson says. So while it would produce some growth, it wouldn’t be stable growth, he argues. IFS director Paul Johnson points out that pay growth has been “unbelievably bad” in the last 15 years, with median pay barely higher than 15 years ago.     11.08am GMT   Q: Is there a case for increasing borrowing now, in the short-run, to prime the pump so the economy grows faster in the long run – bringing down the debt and the deficit in the long term? The IFS’s Carl Emmerson says the risk of cutting taxes or increasing spending now, to lift growth, is that the Bank of England would say “hang on, we’re worried about that injection of cash into the economy”. If the Bank doesn’t see spare capacity in the economy, they could raise interest rates or simply lower them less quickly in response. The argument is different for long-term investment. There may well be investments which could be done well, and deliver a return above the long-term cost of borrowing. Emmerson points out that the UK has been able to borrow at low costs in recent global crises (such as Covid-19); the danger is a UK-specific crisis which prompts international investors to demand a higher rate of return when lending to us.     10.59am GMT   Q: Why are there differences between the OBR and Bank of England growth forecasts? (see earlier post). Have they explained why they disagree? The IFS’s Carl Emmerson says the OBR provides more information about its forecasts than the BoE, which doesn’t really give much insight into what’s behind its projections. He points out that the BoE has been more pessimistic about the impact of Brexit, which may explain why it forecasts slower growth than the OBR. Or it could be because the BoE forecasts are trying to reflect the collective view of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee (the nine policymakers who set interest rates).     10.54am GMT  Key event  Q: Do fiscal pressures mean the State need to stop doing some things?  IFS director Paul Johnson says the UK has a decision to make – it can keep providing the current public services, if people accept that taxes will remain at their current levels, and possibly rise higher over time. The UK has been struggling to avoid this for a long time, Johnson adds – pointing out that in other countries the tax burden rose in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, while the UK’s didn’t.  We’re sort of catching up with them, although we haven’t broadly caught up with the rest of Western Europe.  Some state commitments have been dropped since the 70s, Johnson points out – we’re not subsidising nationalised industries, or building public housing, while there’s a lot more private finance in higher education. Defence spending has been “dramatically cut”, Johnson adds. But that’s now likely to rise in the next few years. It’s hard to see where further deep spending cuts can be made, Johnson adds, given how many public sectors – such as local government, justice, prisons and social care – are already struggling.  My guess is that we’re more likely to end up with higher taxes than we are with the state withdrawing from some provision.  But that is a conversation we ought to be having, and we’re not.      10.47am GMT   The IFS are now taking questions about next week’s budget. Q: Are the current fiscal rules sensible? How realistic is it to be able to predict the size of the economy, and the difference between two large numbers, five years into the future. [this refers to the goal of showing debt falling as a share of GDP in five years time]. IFS’s Carl Emmerson says it’s sensible to have forward-looking fiscal targets. He says the chancellor has another fiscal rule, to be on course to be raising enough revenue to pay for spending in three years time. That’s good, as it gives flexibility if the economy suffers a shock. But it still allows a chancellor to “pretend” to have plans to raise taxes or to cut spending, to hit a target in future. Emmerson adds that there is always huge uncertainty over what the economy will be like in five years time; chancellors should look at the ‘central forecasts’, and build in some margin for error in case of shocks. He adds:  The forecasts we have are the best guide to the future that we have.      10.41am GMT   What if Jeremy Hunt decides to ignore the IFS’s advice, and decides to cut taxes next week? IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson says there are more growth-friendly options than cutting income tax or national insurance. Cutting stamp duty on property purchases, or on shares, would be more growth-friendly, Emmerson says.     10.39am GMT  IFS: Chancellor should hold off from fresh tax cuts until spending review  UK borrowing in 2023–24 is now on course to be £113bn, the IFS estimate, which is £11bn less than forecast by the OBR in November. But it’s still a high amount, the IFS point out today – and “much bigger than forecast two years ago”. Debt is “barely on a downward trajectory” in five years time, despite the forecasts being predicated on unspecified cuts to public spending after the election. The IFS’s Carl Emmerson says:  Clearly the risk here is that whoever is chancellor after the election might be unable or unwilling to deliver on those spending plans.  Therefore, the IFS thinks any fresh tax cuts should be delayed until a detailed Spending Review has been held, rather than implementing further tax cuts now that are “paid for” by uncertain spending cuts in the next parliament.  Updated at 12.38pm GMT    10.32am GMT   The UK’s growth prospects will determine how much wiggle-room the chancellor has for tax cuts or spending increases, while still having debt falling in five years. The IFS point out that the Bank of England’s growth forecasts are rather less optimistic than those of the Office for Budget Responsibility – the independent group who will give their assessment of the budget.     10.19am GMT   Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, runs through the context for the budget on 6 March. Emmerson points out that UK GDP growth has been \"abysmal”, with GDP per head still not above its level in 2019.  The backdrop here is a terrible period of growth going back to 2008.  That period covers the great recession after the financial crisis, the very weak recovery afterwards, the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, and the recent stagnation over the last couple of years – culminating in the current technical recession, Emmerson says.     10.06am GMT   The Institute for Fiscal Studies are presenting their analysis of Jeremy Hunt’s options for the Budget now – you can watch here. IFS director Paul Johnson starts by saying next week’s Budget is hopefully, but not necessarily, the only fiscal event of 2024. He explains:  It may be the first of two, if we get another one before the election, as Jeremy Hunt has threatened. It may be the first of three, if we get one before the election and an emergency budget after the election.

Customer assistants working in London are getting a 9.1% rise, from £12.05 to £13.15 per hour. For M&S’s UK Team Support Managers, the hourly rate will increase from £12.20 to £13.05, while for those in London, it will increase from £13.35 to £14.20. The changes will cost M&S £89m. The real Living Wage, which is based on the cost of living, is £12 or £13.15 in London. The minimum wage (badged as the “national living wage”) is rising to £11.44 an hour in April. From 1st April, M&S is also introducing six weeks’ paternity leave at full pay, and doubling its maternity and adoption leave to 26 weeks – also at full pay – at a cost of £5m per year.     9.38am GMT   Demand for bricks in the UK has weakened – a worrying sign for growth in the construction sector. Brickability Group, the construction materials distributor, told shareholders this morning that sales volumes of bricks have been “significantly” lower in the past year. UK despatches are down around 30% last year and imports into the UK have fallen by 42%, reflecting the drop in housebuilding activity as high interest rates have hit demand. Brickability has warned that lower levels of demand for bricks and associated building products are likely to persist through to the end of the current financial year, meaning its profits will be at the lower end of expectations. Shares in Brickability have fallen by 12%. A decade ago, homebuilders were facing a brick shortage, as suppliers struggled to keep up with strong demand for new houses.

Abrdn was formed in 2017 by the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, and shed most of its vowels in 2021. Today, it reported that its operating revenues fell 4% last year to £1,398m, due to “outflows and adverse markets”.  Operating profits shrank by 5% to £249m, with Abrdn reporting net outflows of £17.6bn last year across its businesses. Assets under management dipped by 1% to £494.9bn. Stephen Bird, chief executive officer of abrdn, says:  “Over the past three years we have reshaped the business to fit the modern investment landscape. We now have content and distribution aligned to the products and services clients need, and we are better positioned for future growth.” “The investment industry faced further structural and macroeconomic challenges during 2023 with a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment across developed economies adding sustained pressure on most asset classes.”  Last month, Abrdn announced it would cut 500 jobs, including at its head office and in its back office support teams. Today, Abrdn says the implementation is expected to take place primarily in 2024, and will be completed by the end of 2025. John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, says abrdn has been in “more or less a constant state of flux” for the past few years, adding:  This challenging backdrop is reflected in today’s mixed results, which has some signs of bright spots but also highlights areas for improvement.  Interactive Investor remains the stand-out performer and the growing diversification of abrdn’s business is helping to steady the ship. However, another transformation programme introduces a degree of uncertainty and the uncovered dividend feels too high at its current level for the period of change the company is going through.”       8.29am GMT  Shop inflation at two-year low as cost of living squeeze eases  There’s good news to report on inflation this morning. First, shop price inflation has fallen to its lowest rate in nearly two years, according to the British Retail Consortium. The BRC reports that shop price annual inflation eased to 2.5% in February, down from 2.9% in January, which is the lowest since March 2022. Food prices rose by 5% over the last year, and dipped by 0.1% during February alone. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said:  Food prices fell month-on-month with drops in fresh food including meat, fish and fruit. This was driven by easing input costs for energy and fertiliser while retailers competed fiercely to keep prices down. In non-food, inflation for furniture, electricals, and health & beauty products rose, but the price of clothing continued to fall as many retailers kept promotions in place to entice consumer spend.     Related: February dip sends UK food price inflation to nearly two-year low   Secondly, data firm Kantar has just reported that gocery price inflation has fallen to a two-year low. Kantar’s data shows that supermarket prices were 5.3% higher than a year ago in February, the lowest rate since March 2022, down from 6.8% in January. Fierce competition among supermarkets is offsetting the cost of disruption to Red Sea shipping routes, Kantar’s report shows, as grocers pass on falls in raw material costs to consumers. Falling inflation doesn’t mean prices are falling, of course – they’re just rising at a slower rate. But that should please the Treasury and the Bank of England, as the latter tries to bring inflation down to its 2% target and keep it there.

Labour would be forced to either raise taxes or deliver on the Tories’ spending cuts, Rahman points out in an analysis piece this morning. Rahman says:  The chancellor has already pencilled in cuts of £20 billion over the next few years in what Labour regards as a “scorched earth” policy designed to create a rotten inheritance for the party if it wins power.  Rahman adds that Britain’s fall into recession is “politically toxic” for the government, and risks blowing a hole in Sunak’s reputation for economic competence. He says:  Tory backbenchers privately fear that headlines about “the R-word” (recession) have not only handed Labour the slogan of “Rishi’s recession” but will also deter people from spending, which could in turn compound the UK’s growth problem.      7.59am GMT  Jeremy Hunt \"plans national insurance cut and vape tax for budget\"  The Times are reporting this morning that Hunt will use next week’s budget to cut national insurance, rather than income tax, and annnounce a new levy on vaping. They say the budget on March 6 is expected to be far more limited than last year’s autumn statement, as forecasts suggest he will have much less money to spend than expected. According to The Times:  The two main tax cuts expected in the budget are a 1 percentage-point reduction in employee national insurance, at a cost of about £4.5 billion a year, and an extension of the fuel duty freeze at a cost of £1 billion a year.  More here (£).     7.54am GMT  Full story: Jeremy Hunt’s ‘dubious’ financial planning lacks credibility, says IFS  Jeremy Hunt’s financial planning is “dubious” and “lacks credibility” and the chancellor should not announce tax cuts in next week’s budget if he cannot lay out how he will fund them, an economic thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculates that Hunt would need to find £35bn of cuts from already threadbare public services if he plans to use a Whitehall spending freeze to pay for pre-election giveaways. A fresh round of austerity in unprotected departments would boost the chancellor’s war chest for tax cuts, the independent tax and spending watchdog said, but an increase from an expected £15bn of headroom to about £50bn over the next five years would come at a high cost. The IFS called for vague pledges to reduce spending to be replaced with concrete plans on where savings could be achieved, given the likely hardship and difficulty of achieving further reductions. Its report said:  “The economic case for tax cuts is weak. The public finances remain in a poor position.  More here:   Related: Jeremy Hunt’s ‘dubious’ financial planning lacks credibility, says IFS       7.53am GMT  Introduction: Hunt warned pound would suffer if he misreads the markets  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. With just over week to go until the budget, Jeremy Hunt is being warned not to risk unfunded tax cuts that could cause ructions in the financial markets. The chancellor is understandably keen to offer some pre-election sweeteners, in the hope of closing the gap with Labour. City economists, though, warn that there may not be as much fiscal firepower to play with as Hunt would like. ING, the Dutch banking group, estimates that the money available for tax cuts – so-called “headroom” – now equals £18bn. That’s up from £13bn in November, but lower than estimated a few weeks ago, as the City has cut it expectations for Bank of England rate cuts. This headroom is the amount of money the chancellor can spend, and still hit his fiscal rule – to have debt falling, as a share of GDP, in five years time.  The reappraisal of Bank of England rate cuts in financial markets means the money available for giveaways at the Spring Budget has dwindled, writes @SmithEconomicshttps://t.co/vwXQOKvGnF— ING Economics (@ING_Economics) February 26, 2024  £13bn could, potentially, allow the chancellor to cut income tax by 2p in the pound – as a 1p cut to the basic rate of income tax is slated to cost roughly £7bn/year. That wouldn’t leave very much left over, though. As ING’s developed market economist, James Smith, puts it in a research note this week:  The situation is tight. And it’s possible our estimate of headroom is too optimistic.  What about cutting spending, though, to free up money for tax cuts? ING says such spending restraint looks “unrealistic”, given the government’s current plans already imply more painful austerity for departments.   Related: UK public services will buckle under planned spending cuts, economists warn   Talk of tax cuts will revive visions of the 2022 mini-budget debacle, when Kwasi Kwarteng crashed the pound and the bond markets by announcing unfunded tax cuts, without any scrutiny from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. The situation is different this time – the OBR will give its verdict as soon as Hunt sits down next Wednesday after delivering the budget. Smith says that funding tax cuts today with unrealised and potentially challenging spending cuts tomorrow may “raise a few eyebrows among investors”, but in reality this wouldn’t be a new approach. Smith told The Guardian:  “The savings earmarked so far are already very challenging and further savings appear unrealistic. Talk of tax cuts inevitably triggers memories of the 2022 mini budget crisis, where UK government borrowing costs rose precipitously following a package of unfunded measures designed to boost growth.”  He warns, though, that fresh tax cuts could still apply some upward pressure on yields – the measure of Britain’s borrowing costs. ING’s gauge of risk premium in the government bond market suggests investors are still keeping an eye on UK fiscal risk – with UK borrowing costs higher than Germany’s, but in line with the US. Sizable cuts to income tax would add further impetus for the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold a little longer, ING predicts, meaning more pain for borrowers and a delay to rate cuts. ING reports that market conditions in the currency market are calm, which should please Hunt. They say:  When it comes to FX markets, current market conditions could not be more different than those that prevailed at the height of the Liz Truss debacle.  But, they warn that if the chancellor was to “misread the mood of gilt investors and cause another upset”, sterling would take a hit. ING add:  Short-term models suggest a 2% sell-off in sterling could happen quite easily were investors to again demand a risk premium of sterling asset markets.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies are pointing out this morning that UK taxes are heading to record-high levels, as a share of national income. They warn that the public finances face an ‘unhappy outlook’, with debt high and rising, and barely on track to start falling in five year’s time. In a warning shot to Hunt, they say:  Unless the Chancellor is willing to spell out where the cuts will fall, the temptation to scale back provisional spending plans further to ‘pay for’ new tax cuts should be avoided.  We’ll hear more from the IFS this morning, as they present their analysis of Hunt’s options ahead of the budget.

        "content": "The UK electrical goods chain Currys has rejected an improved takeover offer worth £742m from the US investment group Elliott Advisors. The new offer from Elliott, which owns the Waterstones book stores and has a controlling stake in the restaurant chain Wasabi, was pitched at 67p a share, up from its earlier bid of 62p a share in mid-February, Currys said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. The retailer said its board had unanimously rebuffed the new bid, which was first reported by Sky News, “on the basis that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects”. After Elliott’s first bid, the Chinese online retailer JD.com also said it was considering making an offer for Currys. Last week, the retailer’s biggest investor, the fund manager Redwheel, backed the board’s decision to reject Elliott’s first offer, arguing it was worth a lot more. Shares in Currys were down 1% after it announced it had rejected the second offer, giving the company a market value of about £746m. Elliott is known as an activist shareholder that has pushed for change at the drugmaker GSK and the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, and has amassed high-profile investments such as the Italian football club AC Milan, which it later sold. It has also acquired a number of retail businesses through its private equity investment arm. Currys, which has faced a tough market, was created through the 2014 merger of the mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail, which brought household names Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse under one roof. The business dates back to 1884 when it was founded by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1927. It is now a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies. In 2021, Currys shifted its strategy to merge the four brands it operated – which included PC World, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse – into one master brand. Currys employs more than 15,000 people in the UK and has about 300 stores. During the pandemic, it closed the 531 Carphone Warehouse stores it owned in the UK, with the loss of 2,900 jobs. ​​ In November, the company struck a £175m deal to sell its Greek business. Under UK takeover rules, Elliott must announce a firm intention to make an offer for Currys by 5pm on 16 March, or walk away. Elliott declined to comment."

As part of what it calls a “bold new chapter”, the retailer – which in January announced plans to cut 2,350 jobs, or 3.5% of its workforce – said it would concentrate more on luxury shopping. As part of this focus, Macy’s plans to open 15 of its higher-end Bloomingdale’s stores, and 30 Blue Mercury cosmetics locations. “A bold new chapter serves as a strong call to action,” Tony Spring, the new chief executive officer of Macy’s, said. “It challenges the status quo to create a more modern Macy’s, Inc. “We are making the necessary moves to reinvigorate relationships with our customers through improved shopping experiences, relevant assortments and compelling value.” Alongside the closures, Macy’s pledged to prioritize investment in about 350 locations, and expand smaller stores. Employees at Macy’s are “energized by the work ahead”, Spring claimed, “as we accelerate our path to market share gains, sustainable, profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders”. Shares in Macy’s dropped 1.4% during pre-market trading on Wall Street. Last month, the retailer rejected a $5.8bn takeover offer from the hedge fund Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, an investment manager. Even before the pandemic, department stores were facing intense competition from online rivals. Neiman Marcus and JCPenney both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

        "content": "A business associate of the oligarch Roman Abramovich has failed in his latest attempt to overturn sanctions that were imposed on him after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a case widely seen as a crucial legal test for the post-Brexit UK sanctions regime. Eugene Shvidler, who served on the board of companies owned by Abramovich, was sanctioned by the UK government in March 2022 as part of measures to target Russia-linked oligarchs and officials after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Shvidler challenged and lost a case against his sanctions at the high court last year. He had claimed the measures caused disproportionate hardship and discriminated against him as a Russian-born person, and that he was not closely associated enough to Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea football club, to justify being placed under sanctions, but the high court ruled in favour of the Foreign Office. Shvidler then went to the court of appeal, which on Tuesday dismissed his latest challenge in a ruling that will be closely watched by sanctioned oligarchs wanting to bring their own legal challenges to the UK courts. Shvidler now plans to appeal against the decision at the UK’s supreme court. Lord Justice Singh, giving the court’s ruling, rejected Shvidler’s complaint: “I would accept that these sanctions are both severe and open-ended. But this does not meet the fundamental point that sanctions often have to be severe and open-ended if they are to be effective.” The UK government imposed sanctions on Shvidler on grounds including that he was associated with Abramovich, who in turn had obtained a benefit from or supported the government of Russia. The Foreign Office argued the men were associated because Shvidler was a long-serving director of Evraz, a steel and mining firm in which Abramovich was a major shareholder. It said he had also served as chair of Millhouse LLC, the Moscow-based arm of the UK company that managed assets for Abramovich and Shvidler himself. The court of appeal dismissed arguments from Shvidler that he had no more received a financial benefit from Abramovich than had the other 70,000 Evraz employees and agreed with UK government arguments that it had “reasonable grounds to suspect that the appellant had received significant financial benefits from Mr Abramovich”. Shvidler was born in the Soviet Union but moved to the US in 1989, and then to the UK in 2004. He gained citizenship of the US and UK and had never been a citizen of the Russian Federation, the ruling noted. Shvidler’s lawyer, Michael O’Kane of Peters & Peters, said in a statement that if the ruling stood it would make it virtually impossible for any person sanctioned by the UK government to bring a successful legal challenge. “Despite this setback, Mr Shvidler retains his faith in the UK courts. Given the very important issues raised in this case and the ongoing impact of sanctions on him and his family, he intends to bring the matter before the supremecourt at the earliest opportunity,” the statement said. Alexa Magee, a legal researcher at the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, welcomed the ruling: “With two major appeal wins under its belt, the government has been given the green light to pursue sanctions with even greater ambition. While the court warned it will not rubber-stamp government decisions or give political hyperbole a free pass, these decisions show how high a bar there is for designation challenges to succeed.” The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: “We welcome this judgment and the message it sends about the strength of the UK sanctions regime.”"

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has met the boss of Shein in an attempt to persuade the fast fashion retailer to float on the London stock market, as it emerged the company has run into potential problems with a listing in the US. The UK chancellor met Donald Tang, the Shein executive chair, this month to discuss a potential initial public offering (IPO) in London, and the discussions were “productive”, Sky News reported. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We have developed reforms to boost the UK as a destination for IPOs, including making it easier for companies to list more quickly.   Related: Chris Xu: Who is Shein’s mysterious billionaire founder?   “The government does not comment on individual companies – it is for individual firms to decide where to list.” Shein, which was founded in China but is headquartered in Singapore, is in the early stages of exploring a London listing because it believes it is unlikely that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would approve its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported. If it were to go ahead it would be one of London’s biggest ever corporate listings and a potential boost to the country’s standing as a global financial centre, after a number of companies snubbed the London Stock Exchange in favour of the Nasdaq in New York, despite the UK government’s efforts to persuade more firms to list there. Indivior, which makes opioid addiction treatments, said last week that it was sounding out shareholders over plans to move its primary share listing to the US this year. Earlier this month, the Anglo-German travel company Tui said it would ditch its share listing in London, after shareholders voted overwhelmingly for a sole listing in Frankfurt. The Tui chief financial officer, Mathias Kiep, said there had been a shift in liquidity from London to Frankfurt. The Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, whose chips power nearly every smartphone and which is owned by Japan’s SoftBank, opted for a listing on New York’s Nasdaq last year along with other tech companies, in a snub to Rishi Sunak’s government, which had tried to persuade the company to float in London. About $1bn (£790m) was raised in the UK through IPOs last year, the lowest level in decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shein is still working on its application to list in the US, Bloomberg said, and would need to file a new overseas listing application with Chinese regulators if it decided to switch to London or elsewhere. Other potential locations for a listing include Hong Kong and Singapore. In November, the company lodged confidential paperwork with US securities regulators, informing them of its intention to go public in the US. The listing would be one of the largest IPOs in years. Shein is one of the global leaders of fast-fashion e-commerce, harnessing a network of small-shipment manufacturers in China, and has a massive online advertising presence. It was founded by the mysterious billionaire Xu Yangtian, also known as Chris Xu, in Nanjing in 2008. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: “Having one of the most disruptive names in retail float in the UK would certainly do wonders to help fix the London Stock Exchange’s damaged reputation as a listing venue. Shein is now a household name in many parts of the world and the go-to website for teenagers and young adults seeking bargain clothes. “Investor interest could be huge, which bodes well for attracting other names to list in the UK after a patchy spell that has seen a growing number of big stocks turn to the US as their main stock location. “Shein wants to be seen as a global business and having a Western stock listing rather than one in China would position it differently in the eyes of investors. It would imply greater stock liquidity and higher levels of transparency and corporate governance.” Shein declined to comment."

AT&T, whose 5G network covers about 290 million people across the US, grappled with interruptions to its service for more than 10 hours on Thursday. AT&T restored wireless service later that day, saying it believed the issue had been caused “by the application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network”. The company said on Saturday it was crediting affected consumers for the average cost of a full day of service.

AT&T said on Thursday it did not believe a cyber attack caused the outage, rather a botched expansion of its network had disrupted services. The outage affected people’s ability to reach emergency services by dialing 911, according to posts on the X social media platform by government departments in several US cities. In 2021, regulators settled for $19.5m an inquiry into a June 2020 T-Mobile outage that lasted over 12 hours and led to more than 20,000 failed 911 emergency calls."

        "content": "There was a time when Charlie Bigham would regularly get calls from customers demanding to know whether he really existed or was just a made-up front for his fresh ready meals company. Not only is Bigham real – it’s his face on the pack – he is still the majority owner and a full-time worker at the business he began, appropriately enough, at his kitchen table in 1996. And he looks just like he appears on his fish pie packaging and in the company’s animated TV ads: floppy silver hair, casual clothing, a friendly smile and a bluff manner. He is real enough to be organising cups of tea for everyone and proudly showing off the London outpost of his empire, where chefs are busily rustling up cement-mixer-size vats of spiced chicken, salmon and bechamel sauce. At 56, Bigham has no plans to sell up or “cede control”, noting that if you do that, and make agreements with an initial buyer, any future owners may not adhere to your wishes. He cites the case of the Body Shop, whose founders, Anita and Gordon Roddick, sold out to French cosmetics multinational L’Oréal in 2006. The company has passed through two owners since then, and went into administration this month with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Some say the problems the Body Shop had show that it’s not possible to survive as an ethical business in a cost of living crisis. This is “complete nonsense”, according to Bigham. “[Behaving ethically] is absolutely core to who we are, what we do, where we’ve come from and where we’re headed. I absolutely believe that businesses are a force for good in society. I come across loads of businesses that are just quietly getting on and doing the right thing.” His company is certified as a B Corp, which means it has met certain ethical and environmental standards. For Bigham’s, these include shares for employees, investing in solar panels as part of a plan to eventually meet half its energy needs through renewables, heading towards zero food waste and using wood or ceramic containers instead of plastic. The brand offers a wide choice of vegetarian dishes – although nothing vegan – and while it doesn’t promise that its chicken is all free-range or its meat all from UK farmers, it does pledge to source ingredients to high ethical standards, and to pay its staff more than the minimum wage. Bigham worked as a management consultant after university and then ditched that to go travelling in India. He says he was inspired to start a food business by his disappointment with the ready meals available at the time, whose ingredients lists “read like a chemistry lesson”. And they almost always required a microwave oven, a cooking device he was and still is against. Bigham says he was always entrepreneurial: even as a child, he would take photos of school plays to sell to other pupils. “I just wasn’t very good at working for someone else. I didn’t like being told what to do. I’m quite opinionated.” Using “very little” savings, he began by making and selling fresh ready meals to London delis but was advised that selling just to that market would be tough. So, he says, he cold-called Waitrose, managed to organise a meeting and within a few months of starting the business had signed the posh supermarket as his first major stockist. Bigham’s posted sales of almost £133m in the year to August 2023, and now sells to most of the UK’s major supermarkets. Profits rose almost 22% to £5.6m last year, allowing it to pay a £2m dividend, most of which went to its founder. In 2002, it bought ByRuby, a frozen ready meals brand, and expects sales to rise to £140m this year. Bigham’s now employs more than 640 people, at sites in Dulcote, Somerset, and north-west London. Bigham says his main goal now is to improve the quality of his food. His ready meals were never cheap and have gone up in price by more than 20% in the past two years, with the bestselling fish pie for two now costing £9.95.   It’s a big shock to us all as consumers to get used to this new world. I think some people are hoping it’s going to flip back to the old world. But it’s not  Charlie Bigham    Bigham is unapologetic: the costs of ingredients, staff and energy have all increased, he says, and he won’t cut corners to save pennies. “It’s a big shock to us all as consumers to get used to this new world. I think some people are hoping it’s going to flip back to the old world. It’s not, because these are structural changes.” He says erratic weather is only likely to add to problems in the short term, with pressure on root crops such as potatoes and carrots. “We had a very wet winter across Europe, and that will find its way through.” On Brexit, he says leaving the EU has been “very harmful to British business”, adding: “I haven’t seen a single benefit from it yet.” He believes much of the impact has been hidden by the effects of Covid, and after that the inflation linked to the war in Ukraine, but says it has created more friction for importing goods, and made it harder to recruit. Despite all the problems, he remains enthusiastic. “I love working in the business. I’m proud of what we do. I think we’re just in the foothills of potential. So there’s plenty to keep me busy and engaged.” CV Age 56Family “Lovely wife and four great children (aged 20 to 26).”Education Edinburgh University (English literature).Pay “Enough!”Last holiday India.Best advice he’s been given “Employ brilliant people – even if you can’t afford them.”Biggest career mistake “Not sure if I qualify as having a career – I’ve been doing the job I’m doing [founder] for 28 years.”Phrase he overuses “A little bit better – every year, every month, every week, every day”; and “How can we, rather than why can’t we”.How he relaxes “Easily.”"

        "content": "Grocery price inflation in the UK has slowed to a two-year low as fierce competition among supermarkets offset the impact of the Red Sea shipping crisis on goods prices. In a boost to households, supermarket prices were 5.3% higher than a year earlier in February, the lowest rate since March 2022 and down from January’s 6.8%, according to the analyst Kantar. Grocery sales grew by 5.1% in the four weeks to 18 February. Tom Steel, the strategic insight director at Kantar, said: “Things are looking up for shoppers this February. Consumers have been navigating a grocery inflation rate of more than 4% for two years now, so this latest easing of price rises is especially welcome.   Related: February dip sends UK food price inflation to nearly two-year low   “Though there’s been lots of discussion about the impact the Red Sea shipping crisis might have on the cost of goods, supermarkets have been pulling out all the stops to keep prices down and help people manage their budgets.” A separate report from the British Retail Consortium showed food inflation fell to 5% in February from 6.1% in January, amid tumbling energy costs and a supermarket price war. As the price war intensified among retailers, Morrison’s became the latest retailer to launch a price match scheme with Aldi and Lidl, after Asda made the move in January. Promotions picked up again after a post-Christmas slowdown, and consumers spent £586m more on them than in February last year, up 4%, according to Kantar. Sainsbury’s and Iceland were the only retailers to attract more shoppers through their doors. People celebrated Valentine’s Day by spending 12% more on steak and 16% more on boxed chocolate than last year. But they were on the hunt for value, spending £36m on meal deals costing £10 or more in the week leading up to 14 February. This figure is slightly down on 2023 when spend hit £43m, but that was because consumers chose to make more savings this year through price cuts, Kantar said. Sales of chilled ready meals and desserts on promotion did particularly well this year. As “Dry January” ended, alcohol sales volumes jumped by 18% on the previous month, with consumers buying 28% more wine and 16% more beer and lager. Red wine was particularly popular, with 8m more bottles bought this month than in January. Lidl was the only retailer to achieve double-digit growth: its sales rose by 10.9% over the 12 weeks to 18 February, making it the fastest-growing grocer for the sixth month running. It increased its share of the market to 7.5%. Its fellow discounter Aldi also grew faster than the overall market, with sales up by 5.7%, maintaining its 9.4% share. Sainsbury’s and Tesco, Britain’s largest grocer, increased their share of the market, as their sales grew by 7.6% and 6.2% respectively."

        "content": "Women occupy more than two in five seats on the boards of the UK’s biggest listed companies but there are still “too few” in top positions with just 10 female FTSE 100 chief executives, according to a report. The proportion of board positions held by women in the FTSE 350 rose to a record high of 42% this year, according to the government-backed annual FTSE Women Leaders Review. This is up from 24.5% in 2017 when the report was launched. It said the UK compared well internationally, and was in second place behind France, and ahead of Norway, which both have quotas.   Related: Jeremy Hunt warned not to spook markets with unfunded budget tax cuts – business live   Burberry came top again, with 55.2% female representation on its board, followed by Marks & Spencer (51.3%), Next (50.6%) and National Grid (48.7%). However, “the standout disappointing statistic among a sea of progress at every level” is the number of female chief executives in the FTSE 350, the report said. In 2011, 15 CEOs were women, and that number has risen to 21 today. There are only 10 companies led by female chief executives in the FTSE 100, the top 100 listed businesses. They are: Emma Walmsley at GSK, Jennie Daly at Taylor Wimpey, Amanda Blanc at Aviva, Debra Crew at Diageo, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent, Louise Beardmore at United Utilities, Stella David at Entain, Margherita Della Valle at Vodafone and Milena Mondini at Admiral Group. Allison Kirkby has recently taken the helm at BT, while Alison Rose quit as chief executive of NatWest in December. There was better news on functional roles, in particular FTSE 100 finance directors and chief information officers, which recorded gains, and are being recognised increasingly as stepping stones to the CEO role.  Interactive  In the FTSE 100, 25% of finance directors were female, up from 23%, and 27% of chief information officers were women, up from 21%. Women make up 30% of executive committees. Female chairs were appointed at BAE Systems and Barratt last year, Cressida Hogg and Caroline Silver. However, five women chairs retired at the end of their tenure, or for personal reasons. Nine companies in the FTSE 350 still have all-male executive committees, down from 54 in 2017. They are Aston Martin Lagonda, Savills, Hochschild Mining, Foresight Group, Primary Health Properties, BBGI Global Infrastructure, Bellway, International Distributions Services and Fresnillo. Under Financial Conduct Authority rules, women should make up at least 40% of a company board, and at least one of the senior board positions – chair, chief executive, chief financial officer or senior independent director – should be occupied by a woman. Penny James, the co-chair of the review, said: “While the number of women in senior executive decision-making forums has increased, the rate of improvement needs to step up. To meet our target of 40%, we will need to see a woman appointed into every other senior leadership position; that means around half of all roles.” Among private companies, John Lewis Partnership led the way with 62% women in leadership, while Ranjit Singh Boparan’s 2 Sisters Food Group, Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos, Bestway Group and JC Bamford Excavators did not respond. The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, said: “FTSE 350 companies have surpassed this [40%] target, showing that change doesn’t always require top-down interventions but can occur when everyone is pushing in the same direction. This progress is very welcome, and I’d urge business to keep up this momentum to achieve better balance in leadership positions as well as in boardrooms.”"

        "content": "It seems the UK financial and corporate establishment is agreed. The London stock market is in a funk, with too many companies hopping off to re-list in New York. Therefore the UK executive class must be given US-style pay packages to keep ‘em loyal. That’s a slight exaggeration since, so far, it’s only a handful of companies – the likes of AstraZeneca, HSBC, LSEG (the owner of the London Stock Exchange) and the medical devices group Smith & Nephew – that have revealed, or signalled, that they want to boost executive rewards to keep up with US rivals. And none of them have threatened to quit London. All the same, it’s remarkable that an intense debate about the woes of the London stock market has morphed into a refrain about executive pay in the UK. For the past year, we were told that the lack of buzz in London was caused by the decline of UK pension funds as core owners of the market, or perhaps by stamp duty, or perhaps by the fragmentation of local authority schemes. Now, just as pay season approaches, there’s a new culprit: the perception that chief executives of FTSE 100 firms aren’t paid enough. At LSEG, its chief executive, David Schwimmer, could be looking at a rise from £6.25m to £11m in his potential pay, and he should probably give thanks to the head of the actual London Stock Exchange, a small part of the overall global group these days, for preparing the pitch. It was as recently as last May that Julia Hoggett, the LSE CEO, called for a “big tent” conversation about boardroom pay in the UK versus the US, and she has definitely succeeded in shifting consensus opinion. Big fund management houses, such as Legal & General Investment Management, are talking approvingly about giving companies “necessary flexibility” on pay. In the same spirit, the Investment Association, the trade body for UK asset managers, wrote to remuneration committees last week to repeat its usual arguments about aligning pay to performance but also to add a significant line about ensuring that “the UK is a competitive place to list and remain listed as well as do business”. Translation: if you make a case for higher executive pay, especially if you’re up against US competitors, we will listen. It was only three years ago that 40% of shareholder votes at AstraZeneca were cast against proposals to award larger potential bonuses to the chief executive, Pascal Soriot, even though the company was already a UK corporate star. This year’s proposal is to go further. The company’s modelling shows that Soriot’s “maximum” annual rewards could rise to £18.9m but the actual value, once a rise in the share price is factored in (because most of the bonus comes via shares), could be £25.2m. The current pay policy, said the remuneration chair, Sheri McCoy, “does not provide sufficient headroom to deploy appropriately leveraged pay for performance compensation across our most senior leadership roles”. Prepare for more in that vein from others. Some UK companies, we should probably concede, will be making factually accurate comparisons. UK executives are not underpaid versus peers in the rest of Europe, but boardroom pay in the US is an entirely different league. Soriot has received between £10m and £17m every year since 2016, but many less successful counterparts at US pharma firms will have had substantially fatter wedges. And the same is probably true lower down the company. But it’s not hard to sense where this script could go. About 75% of the earnings of FTSE 100 firms are made outside the UK, with the US obviously being the biggest source. So the list of companies that could consider themselves to be “exceptions” to UK executive pay norms may turn out to be long. Once the door is ajar, everyone will want to rush through. Since it is almost impossible from outside to tell precisely which pleas of competitive pressures from the US are genuine and which are simply self-serving grabs, the ratchet game will begin. A new US benchmark is being quietly legitimised. One doubts the London stock market will be saved in the process."

        "content": "Tumbling energy costs and a price war between Britain’s supermarkets have slowed food inflation to its lowest rate for nearly two years in a boost for households trying to cope on stretched budgets. The cost of meat, fish and fruit dipped in February, meaning food prices rose 5% on last year, down from 6.1% in January and the lowest since May 2022, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) shop price index. Although the figures show prices are still rising, the rate is far lower than the double-digit increases consumers have consistently faced since rising energy prices triggered rampant inflation over the past two years. The index showed food prices fell 0.1% in February on the previous month, its first monthly fall since last September. “This was driven by easing input costs for energy and fertiliser while retailers competed fiercely to keep prices down,” said Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC. A sharp fall in the wholesale price of gas has fed through into household energy bills, with the industry regulator Ofgem announcing last week that its price cap will fall 12%, or £238 to £1,690, from April. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs the major supermarkets are ramping up efforts to compete on price. The cost of living crisis has weighed on retailers’ attempts to maintain their profit margins while attracting customers tackling increases in household bills and shopping budgets. Last week, Morrisons launched a campaign to tell customers it offers the same or cheaper prices than discounters Aldi and Lidl, echoing similar marketing drives by Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s. Overall, shop price inflation eased to 2.5% in February, from 2.9% in January. Nonfood prices rose, up 1.3% on a year earlier and 0.7% on January. Richard Walker, the executive chair of frozen food chain Iceland, said a cost squeeze in its supply chain had eased and it had seen “strong sales” after cutting prices, including on pizzas, beef burgers and ready meals. “Cost pressures throughout manufacturing are coming down and this is starting to come through,” Walker said. “We are passing on the biggest falls faster than wholesale prices are coming down for us to get ahead of the game. For our customers, offering great value is more important than ever.” The BRC figures showed the price of furniture, electricals, and health and beauty products rose, but clothing fell as retailers attempted to lure shoppers with promotions. Dickinson said that easing inflation was “good news” for shoppers, but warned that the increase in shipping costs due to disruption in the Red Sea could push up the cost of non-food items, and reiterated calls for government help on retailers’ business rates bills ahead of next month’s budget.   Related: Charges for loo roll, none for caviar: strange quirks of the UK’s VAT rules   Separate data from the CBI showed retail sales in the year to February fell at a modest pace after a sharp drop last month.

        "content": "The chancellor should axe the annual spring budget and autumn statement in order to provide greater certainty for Britain’s manufacturing industry, according to the main trade body representing the sector. The head of Make UK is calling for the twice-yearly fiscal events to be dropped as part of a package of calls for the government to overhaul its policies on taxing and spending.  Its chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said on Tuesday that Jeremy Hunt’s budget next week should be the last fiscal statement by a chancellor, and that future governments instead should set out their tax and spend policies once, at the start of parliament. Speaking at the Make UK National Manufacturing Conference in London, Phipson said: “If I were to ask [Hunt] to do one thing next week in the budget, it is to announce that, from now on, there will be no annual fiscal statements, let alone two a year. The trade body boss added that the axing of these events should only be reversed in “exceptional circumstances”, arguing that the changes would provide greater stability for companies, which have experienced 26 changes to corporation tax since 2019. The call is one of several put forward, alongside a call for a manufacturing industrial strategy that would increase the country’s manufacturing output from 10% of GDP to 15%. Make UK argues that this would add £150bn to economic output. In recent years, it has become commonplace for both a spring budget and autumn statement to take place annually. However, Make UK, which represents 20,000 manufacturers, argues that having these events, which can introduce significant changes to tax policy, harms investment. A recent survey of its members found that 62% felt frequent changes in policy incentives had made it more challenging to plan business investments over the past three years. Phipson acknowledged that axing both fiscal events would be radical, but argued that “insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result”. He said: “We have had six plans for growth in little over a decade, while the department responsible for industry has been reorganised five times in the same period. Any of you running businesses this way would have gone bankrupt.” Under the proposals, there would be no changes to investment allowances, corporation tax or green targets for five years. The Institute for Government has repeatedly called for a reduction in the number of fiscal events, saying that the current form led to “ad-hoc tinkering” with the tax system, and added uncertainty to the wider structure. Phipson’s other requests are for the government to match other major economies like the US, China and Germany and come up with a national industrial plan. This plan would include driving manufacturing output to 15% of GDP. He said: “Some may see this ambition as fanciful but, as globalisation shifts, why not aim to produce more here so we are less dependent on others for everything, from our food to our energy and security?” The body is also urging the government to significantly increase defence spending to ensure that a minimum of 2% of all government spending is ringfenced around that area. On infrastructure, Make UK believes that the country needs to rip up the expensive and cumbersome planning system and replace it with a fast track for projects of strategic national importance. Phipson also called for a change to the fiscal rules that he argues are preventing investment in capital spending. If the chancellor rejects such a change, Make UK proposes splitting the Treasury into a ministry for finance and a ministry for the economy."

Mistral caused quite a stir at the gathering of global elite, with the Financia Times reporting that one major US tech executive said Mistral was doing “a great job” competing against sophisticated models made by large US companies like OpenAI and Google. Microsoft’s ties with OpenAI have been under scrutiny since the ChatGPT creator fired, then rehired, CEO Sam Altman amid boardroom turbulence. The UK’s CMA watchdog are now seeking comments on the arrangement between Microsoft and OpenAI, which could lead to a formal investigation into the partnership.   Related: UK watchdog to examine Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI       2.57pm GMT   In New York, the stock market has opened calmly. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 leading stocks is up 105 points, or 0.27%, at 39,237.16 while the broader S&P 500 index is just 3 points higher at 5,092.11 points. Both indices had ended Friday night at new record closing highs. Shares in chipmaker Nvidia, which has surged on the back of the AI boom, are up 0.5%. Traders are waiting for new economic data last thiis wek, including the core PCE index which tracks inflation pressures, and the ISM manufacturing PMI. They will show if inflation is still cooling, and whether the US economy is performing well.     2.34pm GMT   Britain’s builders are hailing the CMA’s conclusion that Britain’s flawed planning system is to blame for the shortage of new homes. Richard Beresford, Chief Executive of the National Federation of Builders (NFB), said today:  “Planning should be enabling homes, better places and competition which benefits not just Britain, but the British consumer. The CMA has correctly identified that the UK planning system does the opposite.”      2.11pm GMT  Israel leaves interest rates on hold  Newsflash: Israel’s central bank has left interest rates on hold, despite the economic damage caused by the war with Hamas. The Bank of Israel’s Monetary Policy Committee decided today to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 4.5%. Economists had been split between those who expected a hold, and those who suspected the Bank would cut rates. Announcing the move, the Bank of Israel points out that the country’s economy shrank by over 5% in the final quarter of last year.  It says theres is a “great amount of uncertainty” with regard to the expected severity and duration of the war, which began over four months ago. The Bank of Israel says:  There is a great amount of uncertainty with regard to the expected severity and duration of the war. The war is having significant economic consequences, both on real economic activity and on the financial markets, and the country’s risk premium remains high. Inflation in the past 12 months has moderated, and is within the target range. Expectations and forecasts for the coming year increased slightly, and are around the upper bound of the target range. Expectations for the second year onward are within the target range. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel weakened by about 0.25 percent against the US dollar, with high volatility, and strengthened by about 1.9 percent against the euro and by 1.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. GDP contracted by 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the third quarter, due to the effects of the war. Over the year as a whole, GDP grew by 2 percent. The GDP growth was in line with the Research Department’s forecast from January 2024. Indicators of economic activity and the state of employment point to a gradual recovery following the sharp decline that took place with the outbreak of the war, but there is variance between industries. Activity in the housing market remained moderate, despite the increase in home prices in the past month. The constraints and activity difficulties in the construction industry in view of the war have moderated, but remain significant. Economic activity in most countries remained moderate, while the relatively strong economic growth in the US is prominent. Inflation moderated in many countries, but in most it remains above the central bank targets.      1.45pm GMT   The UK government has welcomed the CMA’s report into the UK housebuilding sector. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says the report will now be carefully considered. A DLUHC spokesperson says:  “Despite the economic challenges, we remain on track to build one million homes this parliament, backed by £10bn investment in housing supply, while our long-term plan for housing will allow us to go even further to build the homes that local communities want and need.”      1.30pm GMT   Logistics firm Wincanton have confirmed that their new mystery approach came from GXO Logistics, as Sky News reported (see 12.10pm). Wincanton are advising shareholders not to take any action yet; it continues to support the takeover offer from France’s CEVA Logistics. Wincanton says:  Although GXO has indicated that it is considering making a proposal for a cash offer, as of the date of this announcement, it has not provided the Board of Wincanton with any formal proposal relating to a possible offer, including as to terms or price. If any such proposal is provided by GXO the Board of Wincanton will carefully consider its terms, in conjunction with its advisers.      12.44pm GMT   A second warning about the risks from shadow banking has come from the Bank of England today. BoE deputy governor Sarah Breeden told a research conference organised by the Bank today that more research into non-bank lenders is needed. Otherwise, Breeden warned, there could be a “credit crunch” if hedge funds, pension funds, insurers and asset managers retreat frm the market. Breeden said (via the FT):  “A shift in the willingness of market-based finance to lend to corporates, particularly those perhaps that are highly leveraged, would have significant implications for the real economy — a credit crunch sourced in market based finance rather than bank lending.”  With the FSB also warning about non-bank financial intermediation risks this morning (see 10.36am), concerns about shadow banking remain high.     12.10pm GMT   Elsewhere in the City, shares in UK-based logistics group Wincanton have jumped 11% as a bidding war looms. Wincanton agreed last month to be bought by French multinational CEVA Logistics in a deal worth £567m, or 450p per share. This morning, CEVA hiked its offer to 480p, valuing Wincanton at £604m. But Wincanton has revealed that it has also “received an approach from a potential competing bidder”, and is providing access to due diligence information as required under the takeover code. Wincanton, which is still recommending the CEVA bid, says:  Although the potential competing bidder has indicated that it is considering making a proposal, as of the date of this announcement, it has not provided the Board of Wincanton with any formal proposal relating to a possible offer, including as to terms or price. If any such proposal is provided by the potential competing bidder, the Board of Wincanton will carefully consider its terms, in conjunction with its advisers.  Wincanton don’t name the mystery second bidder. But Sky News’ Mark Kleinman can be relied on at such times. He’s learned that it is GXO, the American global contract logistics company which acquired retail logistics company Clipper in 2022.  Exclusive: GXO Logistics, the US-based owner of Britain's Clipper Logistics, has approached London-listed Wincanton about a potential rival offer that would trump an agreed £600m takeover by CEVA Logistics, a French operator in the sector. https://t.co/SqBjXHlh60— Mark Kleinman (@MarkKleinmanSky) February 26, 2024  Shares in Wincanton have gained 53p to 501p, above CEVA’s new offer, implying that traders anticipate further bidding action. Wincanton employ over 20,000 people, with 7,400 vehicles operating from more than 160 sites across the country. It ships products for food and consumer goods firms; retail and manufacturing; eCommerce; the public sector; major infrastructure; building materials; fuel; and defence.  Updated at 12.15pm GMT    11.46am GMT   The CMA’s investigation into information sharing (see opening post) is more painful for housebuilding companies than its conclusion that the housing market needs reform (see 7.30am). So says Oli Creasey, property analyst at Quilter Cheviot, who explains:  Up first is the conclusion from the CMA’s report that places the blame for slow house-building (the country habitually misses its target for new home deliveries) largely on the planning system that it describes as protracted and unpredictable, as well as under-resourced. That may not be a surprise for anyone who has tried to navigate the planning permission system in recent times, but is something of a vindication for housebuilding firms. The original study was also looking into the industry’s use of landbanks, with early suggestions being whether builders were stockpiling land and artificially slowing delivery. The conclusion instead is that land-banking is a consequence of the slow planning process – i.e. it might make sense to carry multiple years’ worth of land on balance sheet if planning takes years to complete. Housebuilders will be relieved that their strategy has avoided this blame. However, the other headline – that housebuilders may have shared information regarding pricing, incentives and sales rates – is more troubling. While it is not named as a primary factor in the under-delivery of new homes, it is still possible that firms are found to have broken the law, and fines may be levied as a result. It is difficult to judge the probability of this outcome. While the property market does not have a reputation for arch-secrecy, it’s also unlikely that a series of “smoking gun” emails will be found in senior executives’ email accounts. How strong a conclusion the investigation comes to, and what the impact on the housebuilding firms will be, remains to be seen.      11.08am GMT  UK retail sales slump eases in February  Just in: the slump in UK retail sales has eased this month, which may lift hopes that the economy is escaping recession. The CBI has reported that retail sales fell at a modest pace in the year to February, with a net balance of -7% of retailers reporting a fall in sales rather than a rise. That is a pick-up on the “rapid decline” of -50% iin the year to January, and is the weakest fall since retail sales started sliding 10 months ago. Martin Sartorius, CBI principal economist, explains:  “The slump in retail activity eased in February following an exceedingly dreary start to the year. Nevertheless, with sales expected to continue falling next month, retailers are still planning to reduce headcount and investment going forward. Many retailers will expect to see further pressure on their margins due to the upcoming hikes in business rates and the National Living Wage. In the Spring Budget, the Chancellor should aim to cap the increase in the England business rates multiplier and work with the devolved administrations to do the same, which would help retailers return to a path to growth.”  Official retail sales data from the ONS has showed there was a slump in retail sales in December, followed by a bounceback in January. In a boost to consumers, today’s CBI data shows that selling price inflation year-on-year in February was the weakest since the middle of 2021. A balance of 54% of retailers reported raising prices this month, down from 73% in November. Similar annual growth in selling prices is expected next month (+54%), the CBI adds.     10.55am GMT   Back in the UK, household costs have jumped by almost a quarter since December 2019, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. The ONS has investigated the impact of higher mortgage interest rates on household costs. It found that average UK household costs, as measured by its Household Costs Indices (HCI), increased by 5.0% in the year to December 2023. That followed a 12.4% increase over the same period in 2022. On a cumulative basis, household costs are up 24.7% since December 2019, the ONS reports. The data also shows that owner occupiers’ housing costs have overtaken food and energy as a leading driver of inflation. The ONS says:  Households with the largest mortgages were most exposed to this increase in owner-occupiers’ housing costs, which most often include working-age households with children and above-average disposable income.   The contribution of owner occupiers' housing costs has become increasingly significant, overtaking food and energy as a leading driver of the annual increase in the Household Cost Indices.Read our new article ➡️ https://t.co/YUFNaWiIDT pic.twitter.com/2qdxcicAk5— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 26, 2024      10.36am GMT  FSB chair warns of challenging outlook to global financial stability  The world’s most powerful financial watchdog has warned that the outlook for global financial stability is “challenging”. In a letter to G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs, Klaas Knot highlights debt servicing burdens, and stretched asset valuations in some key markets. The FSB is also concerned about leverage and liquidity mismatch in the market for “non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)”, more commonly known as “shadow banking”. Ths FSB explains:  In his letter, he warns of the challenging outlook for global financial stability, despite steady economic growth and signs of easing global financial conditions.  Debt service challenges could increase, and exposures to sectors facing existing headwinds, like commercial real estate, bear close monitoring. Asset valuations are also stretched in some key markets. Abrupt shifts in market pricing could expose vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those related to leverage and liquidity mismatch in NBFI.  G20 finance chiefs are due to meet in Sao Paulo, Brazil this week, on 28th and 29th February.     10.12am GMT   A new report into Britain’s mental health crisis has found that young people are more likely to be out of work because of ill health than people in their early 40s. The Resolution Foundation is warning that this will have large economic consequences, as that pattern of who is out of the labour market due to ill health changes. Here’s the key points from their new report:  Over one-in-three (34 per cent) of young people aged 18-24 reported symptoms that indicated they were experiencing a common mental health disorder (CMD) like depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder – a big increase since 2000 when less one-in-four (24 per cent) reported these problems. As a result, more than half a million 18-24-year-olds were prescribed anti-depressants in 2021-22. Young people with mental health problems are more likely to be out of work than their healthy peers. Between 2018 and 2022, one-in-five (21 per cent) 18-24-year-olds with mental health problems were workless, compared to 13 per cent of those without mental health problems. Universities have become hotbeds for mental health problems: the share of young full-time students with a CMD has increased at a far faster rate than that of working or out-of-work young people (up 37 per cent, compared to 15 per cent and 23 per cent respectively). Non-graduates with mental health problems are particularly disadvantaged in the labour market. One-in-three young non-graduates with a CMD were workless, compared to 19 per cent of non-graduates without mental health problems, and 17 per cent of graduates with a CMD. A shocking four-in-five (79 per cent) 18-24-year-olds who are workless due to ill health only have qualifications at GCSE-level or below, compared to a one-third (34 per cent) of all people in that age group.  Mental health problems are blighting young people’s education. An estimated one-in-eight (12 per cent) of 11-16-year-olds with poor mental health problems missed more than 15 days of school in the autumn term of 2023 compared to just one-in-fifty (2 per cent) of their healthier classmates.

This helps sustain higher house prices and supports their margins. In this context, the competition authorities are taking a closer look to see if some of the big housebuilders – including Barratt, Berkeley, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and Vistry – have been sharing commercially-sensitive information and using that knowledge to make decisions on build-out of sites and the price of new homes. The CMA notes this is not a significant factor in the persistent under-delivery of homes, nonetheless it is sufficiently concerned that competition in the market has been undermined to take a closer look. A regulatory probe is the last thing the sector needs. It is just finding its feet again after a tricky period for the property market as demand dried up thanks to higher borrowing costs. Housebuilders may also argue the proposed introduction of more red tape, including the establishment of a New Homes Ombudsman, will clip the sector’s wings. However, previous issues around build quality and treatment of customers means they are reaping what they have sown.” Where the CMA will be preaching to the converted when it comes to the industry is identifying problems in under-resourced local planning departments – a familiar grumble in the housebuilding space.”      9.47am GMT   The housebuilders are helping to drag the London stock market into the red this morning. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is down 27 points, or 0.35%, at 7679. The top faller is Ocado, the grocery technology company, down 5.4% after Peel Hunt cut their price target on its stock, followed by Bunzl (4.8%), the distributor, which warned its operating margins will fall this year.     9.25am GMT  Bank of England to cut interest rates five times this year, Goldman Sachs predicts  Elsewhere this morning, Goldman Sachs have predicted the Bank of England will cut interest rates five times this year. That would be a more aggressive easing programme than the financial markets expect. Last week, Goldman pushed back its forecast for the first rate cut to June, from May, when it expects rates to be lowered from 5.25% to 5%. And overall, Goldman then expects four more quarter-point rate cuts – while the money markets expect fewer than three this year. Goldman’s team, led by Sharon Bell, told clients this morning:  The first rate cut has not always been received positively by the markets. Growing growth concerns in 2001 and 2007, for example, more than offset the support that rate cuts provided.      9.20am GMT   The CMA has the power to impose penalty fines of up to 10% of applicable turnover, if it concludes that a firm has broken competition law, points out Anthony Codling, analyst at RBC Europe Limited. Codling suggests that. two or more housebuilders who operate in the same local market could potentially share information to ensure that they don’t both build all their 2 and 3 bed homes at the same time, for example. But he argues that housebuilders are “price takers” rather than price makers – as the market for existing homes is so much larger than the new build market. Codling told clients this morning:  The number of sites where more than one housebuilder operates in exactly the same local market will be in the minority in our view, and we do not believe that housebuilders can materially impact house prices in ways against the public interest. In our view they have more power to cut rather than increase house prices. There may be a few cases where information about house mix phases have been shared in order to increase the choice of homes built in any one period, but site plans are documents of public record. However, no system is perfect and there may be a small number of bad actors who have operated outside of their employer’s own policies and procedures and such instances if found may lead to a penalty fine.      8.51am GMT   Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains why shares in housebuilders are in the red this morning (see 8.03am):  “Housebuilder stocks have fallen as the CMA launches a probe into the sector. Concerns include poor customer outcomes from the quality of new homes, with faults on the rise over the last ten years. A major trigger for the investigation is accusations that some major housebuilders are sharing confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to sales prices and sales rates. Other criticism is levelled at the UK’s overly clunky planning processes, which are contributing to the under-supply of new homes. Seeing rules streamlined could help some of the big listed names shift more houses, but it could also increase competition. The accusations of poor build quality and anti-competitive practice will be of more immediate importance, as findings against either strike could lead to margin degradation in the short term, but this is far from guaranteed.       8.25am GMT   The CMA’s new competition probe comes less than three weeks after the UK’s biggest housebuilder, Barratt, struck a deal to buy its smaller rival Redrow for more than £2.5bn. The two companies reached an agreement over an all-share offer from Barratt, which will cement its position as the country’s largest housebuilder.  The merger between Redrow and Barrat will make this sector even more oligopolistic. Factor in the lack of quality of the product delivered, and the windfall from leasehold, as they retain and/or sell on the land and freeholds, it is high time someone took a closer look here. https://t.co/VmI1aDx2mH— Claus Vistesen (@ClausVistesen) February 26, 2024      8.09am GMT    CMA list of housebuilding concerns:- Planning system hold ups = too few homes built- Producing houses at a rate they can be sold without need to reduce-Estate Management charges-Quality of some new homes- Investigation into 8 developers info sharing https://t.co/Y4euisX1Os— Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) February 26, 2024      8.03am GMT  Housebuilders' shares fall  Shares in housebuilders have fallen at the start of trading in London, after the CMA launched its investigation into the sharing of commercially sensitive information. Persimmon are down 3% on the FTSE 100, followed by Taylor Wimpey (-2.2%). Barratt and Berkeley have both lost 1.5%. On the smaller FTSE 250 index, Bellway are down 2.3%, Redrow has lost 2.2% and Vistry have lost 1.8%. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says:  The announcement of a probe by the Competition & Markets Authority on the housebuilders weighed heavily on the likes of Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Berkeley Group.   Updated at 8.31am GMT    7.59am GMT   You can read the CMA’s report into the UK housebuilding sector, here.  We’ve found fundamental concerns in the housebuilding market, following our market study in England, Scotland and Wales. Read more: https://t.co/NyhnvHYnfr#HousingSector #Housing— Competition & Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) February 26, 2024  In it, the CMA points out that the profitability of the 11 largest housebuilders has been generally higher than we would expect in a well-functioning market, apart from during and after the financial crisis.  Profits in the period from 2013 to 2019 were particularly high, it says sternly. However, the watchdog does not believe it should intervene, for three reasons:   The housing market is highly cyclical and impacted by external factors, including the wider economic climate.  Profitability during the 2010s is likely to have been boosted by supportive economic circumstances and temporary factors that are no longer in evidence, in particular a prolonged period of low interest rates and the Help to Buy schemes’ support for first-time buyers.  There was significant variation in the performance of individual large housebuilders in our sample.      7.52am GMT   The CMA has made several recommendations for how to improve the UK housing sector. They are:  requiring councils to adopt amenities on all new housing estates. introducing enhanced consumer protections for homeowners on existing privately managed estates – including making it easier for homeowners to switch to a more competitive management company.  establishing a New Homes Ombudsman as soon as possible and setting a single mandatory consumer code so homeowners can better pursue homebuilders over any quality issues they face.  But, the CMA adds, policymakes could make “more fundamental interventions”, which would have a significant impact on the quality and affordability of new homes being built. It adds:  These interventions would include a significant increase in non-speculative house building that has previously been led by local councils and housing associations.      7.45am GMT  CMA calls for substantial intervention in the housebuilding market  The Competition and Markets Authority are calling for a “significant intervention” from the government into the housing sector, so that enough good quality homes are delivered in the places that people need them in. CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell has told Radio 4’s Today Programme that the regulator has three areas of concern. First, the significant shortage of supply of new-build housing, partly because the planning process incredibly complex, long costly and unpredictable.  “That is a key contributor to the under-delivery of new-build housing across Great Britain,” Cardell says. But there’s also too much reliance on speculative private development to provide the majority of new build homes the country needs Secondly, the CMA is concerned about the “poor outcomes for new home owners”. Many face “high and unpredictable charges” for privately managed public amenities such as roads, sewers and green spaces. Another poor outcome is the poor quality of some new homes, and the challenges faced by homeowners to get redress where quality issues arise. And thirdly, the discovery that some major housebuilders are potentially exchanging confidential, commercially sensitive information relating to sales prices, sales rates. That finding has prompted today’s competition inquiry. Cardell says:  It’s clearly critically important that all companies comply with competition law.      7.30am GMT  CMA highlights \"fundamental concerns\" over housebuilding market  The CMA’s final report into the UK housebuilding market – released alongside news of the competition probe – highlights a number of problems with the sector. Having conducted a year-long study into the sector, the watchdog has identified several areas where it is failing:  Planning Rules: the planning systems in England, Scotland and Wales are producing unpredictable results and often take a protracted amount of time for builders to navigate before construction can start. The report highlights that many planning departments are under resourced, some do not have up to date local plans, and don’t have clear targets or strong incentives to deliver the numbers of homes needed in their area. They are also required to consult with a wide range of statutory stakeholders – these groups often holding up projects by submitting holding responses or late feedback to consultations on proposed developments. Speculative Private Development: the report found another significant reason behind under delivery of homes are the limitations of private speculative development. The evidence shows that private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices, rather than diversifying the types and numbers of homes they build to meet the needs of different communities (for example providing more affordable housing). Land Banks: the CMA assessed over a million plots of land held by housebuilders and found the practice of banking land was more a symptom of the issues identified with the complex planning system and speculative private development, rather than it being a primary reason for the shortage of new homes. Private Estate Management: the CMA found a growing trend by developers to build estates with privately managed public amenities – with 80% of new homes sold by the eleven biggest builders in 2021 to 2022 subject to estate management charges. These charges are often high and unclear to homeowners. Whilst the average charge was £350 – one-off, unplanned charges for significant repair work can cost thousands of pounds and cause considerable stress to homeowners. The report highlights concerns that many homeowners are unable to switch estate management providers, receive inadequate information upfront, have to deal with shoddy work or unsatisfactory maintenance, and face unclear administration or management charges which can often make up 50% or more of the total bill. Quality: housebuilders don’t have strong incentives to compete on quality and consumers have unclear routes of redress. Analysis also suggests that a growing number of homeowners are reporting a higher number of snagging issues (at least 16). The CMA’s consumer research and other evidence revealed that a substantial minority also experienced particularly serious problems with their new homes, such as collapsing staircases and ceilings.   Updated at 7.31am GMT    7.24am GMT  Introduction: CMA launches competition probe into UK housebuilders  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into Britain’s housebuilders, over concerns that they are sharing commercially sensitive information with each other. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had announced an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley, Bloor Homes, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey, and Vistry, having seen evidence that some housebuilders may be sharing information. Such behaviour could influence the build-out of sites and the prices of new homes and weaken competition in the housing market – an area where too few houses are being build – the CMA fears.  🚨BREAKING: UK CMA STARTS COMPETITION ACT PROBE INTO EIGHT HOUSEBUILDERS $BWY.LN pic.twitter.com/iuP2Vq184o— Smartkarma (@smartkarma) February 26, 2024  Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, says it is “important we tackle anti-competitive behaviour if we find it.” News of the investigation comes as the CMA also publishes its final report on the housebuilding market in Great Britain. The report blames the persistent under-delivery of new homes on the “complex and unpredictable planning system” and the “limitations of speculative private development” (where builders obtain land, secure planning permission, and construct homes without knowing in advance who will buy them or for how much). Les than 250,000 new homes were built last year across Great Britain – well below the 300,000-target for England alone, the CMA points out. The CMA also voices “substantial concerns” about estate management charges – where homeowners face high and unclear charges for the management of facilities such as roads, drainage, and green spaces. The watchdog also found concerns over the quality of some new housing, an area where many owners have reported problems in the last decade.   Related: Why are Britain’s new homes built so badly?

Yet in many cities in the rich world that dirty pall has been banished as car engines have got cleaner and factories have moved away. (Poorer cities are not yet so lucky.) Some people believe that the shift to electric cars could reverse some of that progress: that heavier cars and the particulates they produce by friction mean we could sacrifice cleaner air on the altar of zero carbon emissions. In the EV mythbusters series the Guardian has examined claims about electric vehicles (EVs) looking at issues ranging from carbon emissions and battery fires to the idea of hydrogen overtaking them. The latest in our series asks: do electric cars have an air pollution problem? The claim Electric cars reduce engine pollution to zero, but their brakes and tyres still rely on friction to work. That friction breaks down materials, which can then end up in the environment. Some people claim that the shift to EVs, which tend to be heavier and therefore cause more wear, could cause overall air pollution to increase. In 2022 the UK’s then environment minister, George Eustice, told parliament of “scepticism” over air quality improvements. “Some say that just wear and tear on the roads and the fact that these vehicles are heavier means that the gains may be less than some people hope, but it is slightly unknown at the moment,” he said. The Daily Mail reported that tyre pollution was the “dirty secret of electric cars”, while the Sun reported that “EV drivers have been warned over ways that their super heavy electric cars actually end up producing MORE pollution than petrol and diesel motors”. The science EVs do not burn fossil fuels directly – and would not release any emissions at all if produced using only zero-carbon power. As well as carbon dioxide, that means no release of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and a cocktail of carbon, metals and unburnt hydrocarbons in built-up areas. (Fossil fuel power stations are still problematic for charging electric cars, but they tend to be away from population centres in richer nations.) However, all cars produce particulate matter (PM) from friction on brakes, tyres and road surfaces – leaving a dusty trail of pollution in the air and on the ground. That pollution contains harmful chemicals: one additive, washed from roads to rivers, was found to be the cause of mass death of coho salmon on the US west coast. On the brake front, electric cars generally produce less particulate matter because they use regenerative brakes to stop, according to Euan McTurk, a battery chemist who has examined the particulate issue for the RAC. EV brakes wear down much slower, he said. But electric cars do have a case to answer on roads and tyres because increased weight means greater wear. Transport & Environment, a campaign group, has calculated that EVs are about 400kg heavier on average because of bulky batteries. Many of the claims about EVs causing air pollution reference figures from Emissions Analytics, a private company. Founder Nick Molden said that its measurements show that particulate emissions can be 1,850 times more than those from modern car exhausts, which have become cleaner because of regulations. But that headline finding needs some context: the tests have not been peer-reviewed by scientists, and the industry disputes the findings. Crucially, all cars produce those pollutants – not just electric versions. Measuring tiny particulates is very difficult, and there are relatively few comparative studies so far. That means that there is still uncertainty over whether the extra weight of EV batteries will result in worse particulate pollution. The German tyre maker Continental said vehicle and tyre design is less important in determining wear than driving style and the curves of the road (a point also made by Molden). A Continental spokesperson said: “In principle, EVs do not produce more particulates than an otherwise similar internal combustion engine vehicle just because of the battery-induced increased weight.” There are a lot of moving (and rubbing) parts in any calculation, but some efforts have been made to tot it all up. A study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2020 estimated “the uptake of electric vehicles will lead to very marginal decreases in total PM emissions from road traffic in future years”. The study found heavier electric cars cause marginally more road and tyre wear for the larger PM 10 particles and the smaller PM 2.5. Yet once engine pollution is added in, petrol and diesel cars were marginally worse. Any caveats? There is broad agreement that tyre pollution is still harmful. Many scientists believe that smaller PM 2.5 matter is more damaging, because it can enter the bloodstream and pass into the brain or the placenta. Tyremakers are looking at adjustments to their chemistries. The Tyre Collective, a UK startup, has an elegant potential solution: an electrostatic device that will catch tyre particulates, potentially for recycling into new tyres. “Tyre wear has always been a problem,” said Hanson Cheng, the Tyre Collective’s founder. “It has just been overshadowed. You can’t really claim the title of zero-emission vehicle if there are all these non-exhaust emissions.” Whether petrol or electric, tyre pollution will get worse if the SUV juggernaut continues. Cars are getting ever taller, wider and heavier (which will worsen carbon emissions and energy efficiency). Anna Krajinska, Transport & Environment’s manager for vehicle emissions and air quality, said that there was no conclusive evidence on whether electric cars will increase particulate emissions – but added that we should try to limit the shift to SUVs. The verdict There is no doubt that the car industry still has pollution questions to answer. As the end of the internal combustion engine advances, expect more focus on particulate pollution from tyre wear, as it is one of the few sources of pollution while the car is in use. That could offer big health benefits for humans, flora and fauna. It is certainly the case that ever heavier cars almost certainly produce more tyre particulates. Electric cars are – for now – heavier still than equivalents. But even so, tyre pollution appears roughly comparable between petrol, diesel and electric cars. The other benefits of switching to electric cars – most notably lower carbon pollution – are huge. Fighting air pollution is an important cause, but it does not appear to offer a reason to delay the transition to electric cars."

        "content": "Jacob Rothschild, the financier, philanthropist and scion of the Rothschild banking family, has died aged 87. The City grandee started his career at the family bank NM Rothschild & Sons before leaving in 1980 to co-found a number of companies including J Rothschild Assurance Group, now St James’s Place, with Sir Mark Weinberg. Lord Rothschild held a number of senior roles in the City, including deputy chair of BSkyB between 2003 and 2008. He was chair of RIT Capital Partners, one of the largest investment trusts quoted on the London Stock Exchange, from 1988 to 2019. He played a prominent national role in arts and philanthropy, including as chair of trustees of the National Gallery between 1985 and 1991 and chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund between 1992 and 1998, which oversaw the distribution of £1.2bn in grants to the heritage sector. He was active in the work to restore Somerset House in London and was awarded the order of merit in 2002, which recognises outstanding service in the field of arts, literature, learning and science. Tributes were paid on Monday from the world of business and politics. St James’s Place said it was “deeply saddened”. “As a hugely accomplished financier and a co-founder of St James’s Place, Lord Rothschild leaves an extraordinary legacy in helping to shape the financial advice profession in the UK,” it said. Sir Ronald Cohen, the chair of the Portland Trust and a founding partner of Apax Partners, also paid tribute: “The world has lost a remarkably creative and successful leader of finance, philanthropy and the arts.”  The former chancellor George Osborne, now chair of trustees at the British Museum, wrote on X that Rothschild “made the very most of the privilege he was born into, contributing hugely to the cultural and commercial life of Britain. His contributions to the Waddesdon gallery make it one of the jewels of the British Museum.” Ed Vaizey, a Conservative peer who was culture minister between 2010 and 2016, praised Rothschild as “one of Britain’s greatest cultural philanthropist who did so much to support the arts in this country”. Educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, Rothschild was regarded as one of the sharpest brains in the City in the 1980s and was involved in a number of high-profile deals, including a failed £13bn bid for British American Tobacco in 1989 with fellow business tycoons Sir James Goldsmith and Kerry Packer. In a statement issued to the PA news agency, his family said: “Our father Jacob was a towering presence in many people’s lives, a superbly accomplished financier, a champion of the arts and culture, a devoted public servant, a passionate supporter of charitable causes in Israel and Jewish culture, a keen environmentalist and much-loved friend, father and grandfather.” Rothschild was married for more than five decades to Serena, who died in 2019, and leaves three daughters and a son as well as a number of grandchildren. In a statement on X, the Rothschild Foundation wrote: “He will be greatly missed by his family, his colleagues and his many friends.” Rothschild sat as a cross-bencher in the House of Lords between April 1991 and November 1999 when legislation introduced by the then Labour government reformed the chamber and removed the majority of hereditary peers.

        "content": "Peak summer air fares in Europe are likely to rise again this year by up to 10%, according to Ryanair, as problems with aircraft at Boeing and Airbus leave customers scrambling for seats. The increase would come on top of the sharp post-pandemic rise in holiday flight prices last year when pent-up demand met limited capacity in European airlines. The Irish budget airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said Ryanair may yet have to trim its summer schedules, which were built around the expected delivery of 50 of the 57 Boeing Max 737-8200s it has on order. Quality control issues at the US manufacturer – vividly highlighted by the blowout of a part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines Max-9 in midflight last month – have led to a slowdown in production and deliveries. O’Leary said: “Our summer 2024 schedule was on sale predicated on getting 50 aircraft. If we only get 40 to 45 by the end of March we might need to announce some schedule cuts … mostly on routes with high daily frequencies. “Even our growth is going to be constrained and that leads to a higher fare environment in Europe this summer overall. “Our average fares in summer 2023 rose 17%. We don’t think we’ll see that much – we’re budgeting for 5-10% fare rise.” O’Leary also said fares would be higher partly because of issues with Pratt & Whitney engines on Airbus A320 planes, forcing some to be grounded at airlines including Wizz Air and Lufthansa: “EU shorthaul capacity, which is operating only at 90% of pre-Covid, will be constrained all summer long. Most of Europe is an A320 and Airbus marketplace,” he said. “If we could get all 57 Boeing deliveries before June we would make out like bandits all summer long, because we have airports at the moment beating the door down to us, offering us incentives, because someone else is taking aircraft away.” The Ryanair chief executive said he nonetheless agreed with the US Federal Aviation Administration to limit production rates at Boeing until recent problems had been resolved. He said that the airline had discovered “silly, small things” during inspections of recent aircraft deliveries. He said they would lift floorboards and find a rag or a spanner under them. “It’s indicative of a poor approach to quality control on the line in Wichita or Seattle and Boeing need to fix it.” He said the manufacturer would soon get “out of the eye of the storm”, but added: “At the moment, they’re sloppy. Quality and production standards have slipped, and if you’re spending $100m on a plane, it should be in impeccable, pristine condition.” Ryanair was still negotiating compensation for delivery delays, he said. Boeing said: “We are communicating with customers that some delivery schedules may change as we take the necessary time to make sure that every airplane we deliver is high quality and meets all customer and regulatory requirements. “We deeply regret the impact this is having on our valued customer Ryanair. We’re working to address their concerns and taking action on a comprehensive plan to strengthen 737 quality and delivery performance.”"

        "content": "More than half of UK retailers and exporters have been affected by the disruption to Red Sea trade from Houthi rebel attacks on cargo ships, research by a leading business lobby group suggests. The price of shipping a container from Asia to Europe has gone up by as much as 300% for some businesses, while logistical delays have added up to three to four weeks to delivery times, according to the survey by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). The delays are creating knock-on effects, such as cashflow difficulties and component shortages on production lines, according to participants in the BCC poll of more than 1,000 companies, most of which were small- and medium-sized businesses. The Iran-backed Houthis who control much of north-western Yemen have been attacking merchant vessels in the region since November in what they say is a show of support for Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The US and the UK have responded with their own strikes to protect international shipping on the route, carrying out the latest air assaults against 18 Houthi targets in Yemen this weekend, including weapons storage facilities, and the disruption shows no sign of ending. William Bain, the head of trade policy at the lobby group, urged the government to look at providing support for exporters in next week’s budget amid weak global demand and higher costs. “There has been spare capacity in the shipping freight industry to respond to the difficulties, which has bought us some time. And recent [government] data also indicates the impact has yet to filter through to the UK economy, with inflation holding steady in January,” Bain said. “But our research suggests that the longer the current situation persists, the more likely it is that the cost pressures will start to build.” Bain said it was “a difficult time for firms” as the recent introduction of the government’s new post-Brexit customs checks and procedures for imports from Europe had also been “adding to costs and delays”. “The UK economy saw a drop in its total goods exports for 2023 and, with global demand weak, there is a need for the government to look at providing support in the March budget,” he said.  Interactive  On average, the cost of shipping goods from China to Europe has more than doubled since December, as shipments must now travel around Africa rather than through the Suez canal – a route that takes about two weeks longer. The supply chain problems are expected to be exacerbated next month as China begins shipping again in earnest after its annual pause for the two weeks of lunar new year celebrations – which concluded on Saturday with the Lantern Festival. The current logjam has seen an increase in the use of air freight, with spot rates from China to Europe up 8% in early February and up 14% from China to the US, according to delivery aggregator ParcelHero. David Jinks, the head of consumer research for ParcelHero, said: “Initially, there was a scramble for aviation services as businesses rushed to get products out before the [lunar new year] festivities began. “Now the continuing demand for air freight on this route is because many ships are berthed for the duration and containers are stuck firmly in Chinese ports until manufacturing ramps up enough to restore full services. Air freight enables those companies manufacturing and operating in Asia to leapfrog the Chinese bottleneck.” The credit ratings agency Moody’s warned earlier this month that, if prices remained high, retailers would see a “material impact on profitability by the end of 2024”. The problems in the Middle East come as shipments via the Panama canal are also under stress, as low rainfall has forced it to restrict traffic using its locks. Last year, more than a fifth (22%) of global seaborne containers passed through the Suez canal, carrying goods including natural gas, oil, cars, raw materials and many manufactured products and industry components, according to a recent report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). By the first half of this month, 586 container vessels had been rerouted away from the canal while container tonnage through the waterway fell by 82%."

        "content": "Oxford Street has begun to bounce back, with the proportion of vacant shops down by 40% and almost a fifth of its troublesome candy and souvenir shops now closed. The revival of the central London shopping street has been spurred by a mix of factors, including the full reopening of Tottenham Court Road station at its eastern end and last May’s official launch of the Elizabeth line, which stops there, a bounce back in tourist visitors, from the UK and elsewhere, and a concerted effort by Westminster council to take action against American candy stores. The proportion of vacant shops now stands at 9.3%, down from 15.6% last year and the lowest level since 2021, according to research by the Local Data Company (LDC) while the number of candy or souvenir stores has dropped from 29 to 24. Vacancy levels at the east end of the street, near the revamped Tottenham Court Road, have fallen to 5.1% while the west end, near Marble Arch, is finding life tougher with 12.5% of shops still vacant. New openings over the past year include HMV, which returned to the site of its original store in November, the sportswear brand Under Armour and the beauty brand Rituals. Ikea’s new store is due to open in the former Topshop building near Oxford Circus this autumn, a year later than first hoped, and Moco, the contemporary art museum that has sites in Barcelona and Amsterdam, has secured a spot on the street. Gibson guitars recently began hosting gigs and music lessons in nearby Eastcastle Street. However, the street, which reached a low point in 2022 with the closure of the disastrous £6m Marble Arch Mound, still faces challenges. The Body Shop closed one of its two stores there last week and the future of the Marks & Spencer flagship near Marble Arch hangs in the balance amid a legal battle over plans to raze and redevelop the building. Lucy Stainton, commercial director at LDC, said: “For context, as we headed into 2024 we saw vacancy on high streets across the UK start to creep back up again which makes the stark reversal of empty units on Oxford Street even more remarkable. “With the number of souvenir and ‘American candy stores’ also reducing at the same time, the data is showing a much more positive picture for one of Britain’s most iconic and well known shopping streets.” Dee Corsi, the chief executive of New West End Company trade body, which represents businesses trading on Oxford Street, said the street was “being radically reimagined”. “Nearly 1m square feet of space is under development on the street, as investors look to create new experiences which resonate with the customer of tomorrow,” she said. Geoff Barraclough, cabinet member for planning and economic development for Westminster city council, said: “Oxford Street is back stronger than ever. New stores continue to open on the street, replacing former candy, and souvenir stores, which now operate only 2% of trading floor space.” He said the council’s £90m redevelopment plans for the street in partnership with the NWEC, which was given the green light last month, included new seating, lighting and 64 new or improved pedestrian crossings, would help “bring the street up to modern standards”."

        "content": "Staff at the UK’s financial regulator could be forced to rely on a hardship fund to make up for their “objectively low pay”, according to a union. Unite said a failure to address the salary shortfall at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) risked embarrassing the watchdog, whose workers supervise some of the country’s largest banks and wealth managers. In a letter sent last week to FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, the union said its members had rejected the regulator’s 2024 pay offer, arguing that it did not offset the surge in UK inflation, which was as high as 10% last year and resulted in real-terms pay cuts for many of its 5,100 staff. Unite said the FCA’s employees were now living on “objectively low pay” that fell below the minimum income standards set by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Those standards say that people needed to earn £29,500 to reach an acceptable standard of living in the UK last year. That benchmark is likely to increase further in 2024, prompting the union to suggest that emergency measures would be needed. “Failing to address this means that we, as a branch, will have to look at establishing our own hardship fund for members in 2024 as the demand is there,” Unite told Rathi. “This is highly unnecessary and embarrassing in a regulator publicly championing the role its staff have played in addressing the cost of living crisis for consumer.” The FCA said about 60 of its staff were earning salaries below the Joseph Rowntree Foundation minimum level, the majority of which were apprentices. The prospect of employees having to rely on financial support from the union will raise further concerns over the FCA’s ability to retain high-quality staff, who are responsible for supervising and supporting the oversight of some of the UK’s most complex banks and financial companies. The regulator has struggled to deal with a perception that it has a “revolving door”, in which talented staff leave for higher paid jobs in the City where they can leverage their knowledge about the inner workings of the watchdog. Unite said one of its main concerns was the FCA’s decision to abolish base-pay increases for staff linked to the UK’s rate of inflation. Instead, any increases will be based on performance, with the FCA’s strongest performers in its most senior ranks eligible for increases of up to 3.5%. For its most junior and lowest paid employees, that figure rises to 6.5%. Employees whom the FCA deems to be in need of improvement will receive a 1.5% rise, far below the current inflation rate of 4%. The FCA said: “We offer one of the best employment packages amongst the UK’s regulators and public authorities. We have successfully recruited around 2,000 colleagues over the past two years, including significant numbers in Edinburgh and Leeds. Our voluntary turnover rate at the end of this financial year is expected to be around 7.5%.” The union also claimed there had been a “toxic environment” for staff representatives who had volunteered their time to discuss and negotiate the pay deal with the FCA, having been given minimal information and short notice to discuss the deal with bosses. The FCA denied the allegations. “We do not recognise the characterisation of the environment for staff representatives and have recently enhanced our staff consultative committee to include representatives from Unite and FDA,” it said, referring to the FCA’s other staff union. “The overwhelming majority of staff at the FCA are not members of Unite. We will respond to all feedback received through our robust staff engagement mechanisms.”"

        "content": "An alliance between the Greens and Liberal parties in the Senate could force Jim Chalmers to keep a government power that allows treasurers to overrule Reserve Bank decisions on interest rates. Chalmers announced plans to scrap the veto power in the government response to recommendations from a panel which reviewed the Reserve Bank operations and made suggestions for improvement. But two of the most controversial changes – the removal of powers which allows the government of the day to intervene with the bank in extraordinary circumstances, and the recommendation for a second governance RBA board made up of academic economists has seen pushback from across the political spectrum.   Related: Education minister hints at relief on student Hecs debt and university course fee changes   Greens senator Nick McKim plans to move amendments in the Senate this week to force the government to retain the section 11 powers of the RBA Act which give the government its veto. After pushback against the changes from former treasurers Paul Keating and Peter Costello, and the Reserve Bank governors who served with them, Bernie Fraser and Ian Macfarlane, the Coalition is also withholding support for key aspects of the government legislation.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The former governors and treasurers were united in believing the power needed to be retained as a “safety valve” for both the bank and the government in the “once or twice a century” case of serious disagreement between the two on how to handle an economic crisis. With the Senate committee examining Chalmers’ RBA legislation unlikely to support removing the veto, as well as reservations over the second board proposal, the legislation is unlikely to emerge from the Senate intact. Chalmers said on Friday he was “considering” the development and would “respond in due course”. The RBA review legislation had been expected to pass without much fanfare, with opposition to key elements of the bill taking the government by surprise. But with a fight looming on the government’s “help to buy” shared equity scheme, it is expected Chalmers will negotiate to amend the RBA legislation to avoid an ongoing stoush. The Albanese government will introduce its legislation for help to buy in the coming parliament week, after working through key sticking points with the states and territories on how they would administer the scheme. The Coalition has been consistently opposed to the scheme since before the election, leaving the government to negotiate with the Greens and the crossbench.   Related: Albanese signals Labor won’t negotiate with Greens on housing help-to-buy legislation    The Greens are prepared to step up their fight for renters’ rights in order to pass the legislation, which the government has so far refused to budge on. That means the legislation will enter the parliament without the support it needs to pass, setting up another long battle with the Greens over a marquee housing policy. The government will have more support for its stage-three tax cut changes which hit the Senate this week, where the legislation is expected to pass with the Coalition’s vote.In the lead-up to next week’s Asean summit in Melbourne, the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand R Marcos Jnr, will address the Australian parliament, coming just weeks after Papua New Guinea prime minister James Marape gave his address. The move is part of the government’s ongoing mission to restore relations with key regional partners, and comes ahead of an official upgrade of the Australia-Philippines relationship to a “strategic partnership”."

Attendees could grab name tags and enjoy a table spread filled with assorted fruits, meats and cheeses. To a visitor, the bookshop in Inglewood, California, is beautifully curated, with a memorial painting of Latasha Harlins, a Black girl who was killed by a Korean store clerk in 1991, contributing to the onset of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The Salt Eaters Bookshop also hosts a community board filled with Black-centered events and businesses, and bright colors that catch the eye. In Grant’s eyes, there’s still work to be done.   Related: From camping to yoga to dining, these leaders connect marginalized communities   “People don’t know behind the scenes what it takes to keep a space running, to keep the lights on, to keep the A/C going, to keep the wifi ... , like all these things,” she said. “It’s a lot of output. I mean, it’s worth it, but also like these spaces that people treasure and love are usually run by like one, two people, really not a lot of horsepower behind it. So it’s like, yeah, I’m giving ya all that I got until the end.” Since its opening in 2020, the bookshop has been hit with financial challenges, including the rising cost of commercial rent. A survey conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 32% of Black small-business owners reported facing issues with the increasing cost of commercial rent. According to a 2017 survey conducted by California Reinvestment Coalition, now known as Rise Economy, 54% of California small-business owners reported that they often face displacement. The survey also reported that businesses owned by people of color often have to relocate due to landlords increasing commercial rent. A report by the National Association of Realtors found that commercial rent increased by 3.5% for retail spaces in 2023, which is higher than it was before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. As Grant celebrates entering a new three-year lease, she worries about the challenges that will come with it, including the annual increases. The new lease has increased the bookshop’s total monthly budget for rent, utilities and general expenses by $500-$1,000, she added. With commercial rent rising despite limited funds, Grant knows having a community space in the Downtown Inglewood area means bracing for the impact. “The development is so rapid, and it’s so violent,” Grant said. “And it’s only gonna go up from here.” Grant started throwing rent parties in 2023 to help offset costs. The first had a theme: Beyoncé’s Renaissance album. The bookshop threw another party a few months later, on Juneteenth, a second Renaissance celebration. One-hundred percent of the ticket sales for the parties went to the bookshop’s rent relief fund, which remains live and is 60% under their goal. According to Grant, the proceeds have been able to offset a few months of the bookshop’s rent. “I don’t want for the space to be threatened again,” said Grant. “I just don’t.” Salena Pryor, the president of Black Small Business Association of California, believes that Black community spaces were especially affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, as shutdowns led to many spaces being unable to keep up with the commercial rent. “When [businesses] were able to get qualified for the PPP [Paycheck Protection Program] and EIDL [Economic Injury Disaster Loan], they were so far gone with the rent that … it was almost impossible for them to catch up,” said Pryor. During the pandemic, small businesses owned by people of color suffered more closures than businesses owned by white people. According to a 2021 study conducted by researcher Robert Fairlie and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, 2020 saw a 41% decrease in active Black small-business owners. A Yelp economic report found that Los Angeles suffered the most permanent business closures in the United States in 2020. Pryor asserts that Black businesses need to be financially supported for people to have a space to convene. “When you don’t have the funding to do it, it’s almost like the community suffers,” said Pryor. “When you start seeing these businesses close, you kind of take away the lifeblood of the community.” At a garage sale hosted by Erdavria Rose Simpson, one of the owners and founders of the Lazy Rose Cafe, a Black-owned coffee shop that recently closed in Los Angeles, music from Hamilton played from a loudspeaker. Simpson used to play Hamilton and Disney songs at the Lazy Rose Cafe because they reminded her of being committed to service. Laid on two long tables at the garage sale were materials from the coffee shop, from tea bags to glass containers, ready to be sold to the same customers who had patronized the cafe. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Simpson was inspired to open the cafe after facing burnout in the navy and working in the Los Angeles mayor’s office. She saw that Black women often had to work harder, and she wanted to create and cultivate a place where they could “take a lazy day”. In 2020, Simpson, along with co-owners Antonio Martin, and Yvonne and Kevin Dunigan, opened he Lazy Rose Cafe in the Mid-City area and hosted tea parties and entrepreneurship workshops for the community. The Lazy Rose Cafe storefront closed for good in September 2023 due to lack of funds to sustain the increase in commercial rent and other business expenses. “I’m still thinking through a closure,” Simpson said. “I still desire to make a huge impact, especially [because] I’ve always been community-minded. So it’s like, OK, what’s next?” The garage sale alone won’t be able to cover the amount lost from opening and maintaining the cafe, but for the owners, it’s a way to let go and mourn. Simpson, with the other owners, put thousands of dollars of their personal savings into opening the cafe, she said. They installed improvements such as stairs and counters and purchased a water heater, in addition to paying $4,000 a month for rent the first year. The rent increased to $4,500 for the following two years. When the rent increased to $5,200, and the 52 grants the owners applied to seeking financial help were denied, it was time to close. Simpson says she and the co-owners had many discussions with Botach Management, the property management company they paid rent to, about lowering the rent but were never able to come to an agreement. Botach Management did not respond to requests for comment. Billi Sarafine, a frequent visitor and community member of the Lazy Rose Cafe, says she is still shocked the cafe is closed and will miss hosting her events in the space. “We had to look for other places to host our meetings,” said Sarafine. “The spaces we are now at are not Black-owned, so it’s not the same feeling of ‘you belong here, you’re safe’. It’s still a kind of side-eye. But we try to ignore that and just empower each other.” Even though Andre Taylor isn’t an avid coffee drinker, he brought a friend into the Lazy Rose Cafe one day and fell in love with the energy of the space. After engaging in a deep conversation with the owners that day about love and growth, he decided to join the community. “I don’t really get to see a lot of African Americans around me when I walk around the neighborhood,” said Taylor. “So it was really nice to get a real Black feeling, if you know what I mean, within the space. After meeting them, I was just hooked.” Since the closure of the Lazy Rose Cafe, Taylor has missed walking in and seeing the vibrancy of his people. “To see that empty space, it’s really sad,” said Taylor. “The community can really feel the absence of that.” For Simpson, the only way to move forward was to shut the door fully. “Even though I’m kinda seeing different opportunities and trying to figure them out, I also have to afford myself the opportunity to mourn this one part of it and then get back out there with the objective being how best to serve in the mission that I set for minorities to have lazy days,” she said."

        "content": "Royal Mail is being sued for classifying delivery drivers as self-employed, enabling it to avoid paying holiday pay and the minimum wage, in a case that mirrors a landmark gig economy legal ruling against Uber. The Royal Mail drivers allege that the practice means Parcelforce – the company’s parcel delivery subsidiary – can also make them pay hundreds of pounds in fines when they call in sick. Marc Francis, one of the claimants in the case, which is being handled by the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and the solicitor Leigh Day, said that after 10 years of working for Parcelforce he has “had enough”. The drivers argue that Parcelforce and its parent Royal Mail wrongly classify a large number of its delivery drivers such as Francis as self-employed owner drivers. Despite being classed as self-employed, owner drivers do not have control over the days they work (which are outlined in contracts with Parcelforce), the hours they work (as it is dependent on the number of packages given to them by Parcelforce each morning) or even the route they take (determined by the company’s Route Excellence computer system).   Related: Half of UK gig economy workers earn below minimum wage, study reveals   As self-employed staff, they are not given the same protections as workers, such as holiday pay, sick pay or the minimum wage, and are charged fees when they call in sick. In September, a flare-up of his ulcerative colitis meant Francis could not work for two weeks. When he came back from sickness, he was asked to pay £764 to Parcelforce to cover the cost of the agency worker who covered his route. Another of the claimants with a more extensive delivery route was allegedly forced to pay nearly £1,500 to cover his route when he could not work for two weeks. Francis claimed the practice leaves owner drivers unable to take time off and scared of attending GP appointments given the amount it could cost them. In one email to his depot managers he shared with the Observer, he informed them he had just been told by doctors that he had developed pneumonia but reassured his bosses that he “will be in, in the morning” for work. On another occasion, when the planned cover did not turn up for a shift he had to miss, Francis received a letter from Parcelforce threatening to terminate his contract.  Another part of the complaint surrounds pay. Owner drivers agree individual parcel rates with Parcelforce in their contracts. In Francis’s case, his base rate actually reduced a few years into his time as an owner driver, and despite small increases since, he said he regularly fails to make the minimum wage after deducting his costs. On one day in late January, he made just £58 for a day’s work after paying for fuel and his van lease. Owner drivers do not get paid for parcels that are not delivered successfully, despite drivers spending time and fuel to attempt the delivery, and can see their pay confiscated if they fail to deliver within strict one-hour time windows determined by Parcelforce’s computer system. “The reason why owner drivers are much more suitable to the business is purely down to exploitation,” Francis said. “You can talk to me about money all you want but this case is not about that. All I want is legal rights – rights that we’re due,” he added. The case resembles a seminal legal battle against Uber that went all the way to the supreme court in 2021 in which Uber drivers won the right to be classed as workers rather than self-employed contractors. Francis and the two other claimants in his case – Phil Thomas and Stephen Wardell – first lodged their complaint with the IWGB union but the case has now been taken on by solicitor Leigh Day. The legal firm said that it believed the problems faced by the trio were endemic across Parcelforce and that it hoped to launch a wider group claim in future. “In our view, Parcelforce drivers working for Royal Mail should be entitled to workers’ rights such as receiving holiday pay and being paid the national minimum wage. This issue affects thousands of Parcelforce owner drivers,” said Liana Wood, a senior associate solicitor at Leigh Day. “Often, these drivers have worked for Royal Mail for many years and seen their working conditions steadily decline. Yet, as they are classified as self-employed contractors, they are denied their basic workers’ rights.” A Parcelforce spokesperson said: “All of our owner drivers are self-employed and we refute any claims that this is not the case. “Our self-employed drivers play a valuable role in delivering parcels in the UK and are free to provide their services to other businesses. “Our owner drivers can choose whether to personally make deliveries and collections or arrange for other drivers to do them. We are unable to comment on an ongoing legal claim.” • This article was amended on 7 March 2024. An earlier version suggested the legal action to have Parcelforce drivers reclassified as workers rather than self-employed would bring benefits including sick pay; this should have said “holiday pay”. It is only individuals classed as employees and certain types of worker who qualify for sick pay."

        "content": "Two vast shipping tankers stocked with liquefied natural gas (LNG) will glide up the Milford Haven Waterway this week to unload their cargo at the South Hook gas terminal in west Wales. As the Wilpride and Magdala – arriving from the US and Trinidad and Tobago respectively – dock, energy industry leaders will meet 200 miles away in London, at a crucial juncture for the gas sector. The annual International Energy Week conference will see bosses gather at a hotel in Mayfair amid a tense debate over the pace of oil and gas firms’ transition to low-carbon energy. Last year, then BP boss Bernard Looney (since defenestrated) defended its fossil fuel spending over the sound of noisy protests outside. Activists later let off a smoke bomb at a black-tie dinner, forcing executives on to the street in front of protesters. Speakers will include the chief economists of BP and Shell, and the bosses of France’s Engie, the UK’s Octopus Energy and oil trader Vitol, as well as Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, representing a Labour party under scrutiny for watering down funding for its green policies. A significant talking point at the conference will be the role of gas in the energy transition – and the impact of falling wholesale prices. In recent weeks, European natural gas prices have fallen to levels not seen since before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which intensified an already escalating energy crisis. Gas has been trading at €23 a megawatt hour, the lowest since May 2021 – and down from highs of €319/MWh in August 2022. A multitude of factors have contributed. “European demand remains very low with the second mild winter on the trot,” says Tom Marzec-Manser, head of global gas analytics at consultancy ICIS. “A lot of gas is normally used for heating homes and businesses across Europe, and it hasn’t been used this year.” Warmer, windier weather has also reduced the need for gas-fired power stations to generate electricity, with the under-pressure windfarm industry stepping in. As a result, storage levels in Europe’s gas facilities remain high. A return to near-normal levels of nuclear generation after reactor outages in France has also reduced gas demand. Recession fears in gas-hungry Germany and a hit to manufacturers during the cost of living crisis have also played a part. Disruption in the Red Sea has not caused the price spike some had feared, in part because the Qatari gas which reaches Europe via that route is typically shipped later in the year.   In Britain, a long-term switch away from gas-fired power stations has led many bigger players to exit that sector   The UK industry regulator, Ofgem, confirmed last week that the ease-off in wholesale prices had fed through to household bills. From April, its quarterly price cap will fall by £238 to £1,690 and is expected to fall further from July before rising at the end of the year. The sharp drop in prices has stoked debate over the future of global gas stores, terminals and pipes. In Britain, a long-term switch away from gas-fired power stations has led bigger players to exit that sector, leaving it held by a clutch of smaller, privately owned entities. A commitment from the government to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 (and by 2030 from Labour) has led to fears over a gap in supply to meet an explosion in electricity demand. Industry sources argue that realism will trump targets, and a number of gas-fired plants will almost certainly be kept on hand well into the 2030s to ensure the lights stay on. Analysis by consultancy DNV found that most British homes will still rely on boilers which burn natural gas by 2050, despite the target to hit net zero by that point. Hydrogen has been proposed as an alternative by the powerful gas infrastructure lobby, but condemned by the National Infrastructure Commission. In the US, where a spate of fossil fuel mega-mergers is taking place, Joe Biden has paused LNG exports as its impact on the environment and economy is examined. In Europe, Russia’s cut to piped gas supplies in 2022 sparked a rush to build more infrastructure to bring in shipped LNG. Further huge floating terminals are being built in Germany. “The investment case is still there,” says Marzec-Manser. “The EU has committed to weaning itself off Russian gas, so that’s a significant wedge that will be replaced by LNG.” The floating terminals being constructed can be “unplugged” and shifted to other parts of the world if they become unprofitable in future, Marzec-Manser adds. A squeeze could emerge when a five-year transit deal by Russia’s Gazprom to pipe gas through Ukraine concludes at the end of 2024. At the conference, an eye-catching discussion on the future of natural gas will examine methane emissions reduction and prospects for low-carbon alternatives. Green campaigners will hope it is more than just hot air. • This article was amended on 1 March 2024. An earlier version referred to the vessel Stiklesad as an LNG tanker, whereas it carries LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). The reference has been substituted - to an arriving LNG tanker, the Magdala."

        "content": "Rail’s great zombie hope lurches on. Great British Railways, the future once unveiled by Boris Johnson – declared at times dead, or alive, or simply locked in stasis – came juddering back into the picture last week. The late arrival of a draft reform bill could, rail minister Huw Merriman claimed, still mean that plans for a new “guiding mind” for rail, separate from government, come into law this side of an election. “We will put decision-making in the hands of Great British Railways to integrate track and train,” he promised. But the short document raised more questions from an industry long gaslit by promises of independence, while perceiving more Whitehall micromanagement than ever. Few believe there is time for the legislation to be implemented, even with the promised immediate scrutiny of the transport select committee and an election potentially as late as autumn.  Yet with services disrupted, and costs still far in excess of revenue, the industry consensus is that something must change. The drivers’ union, Aslef, remains in dispute after more than 18 months of strikes over pay. Attempts to cut costs by closing ticket offices foundered in a public backlash. In both rows, reluctant train operating firms have been browbeaten into fronting up for government policy – but with the Treasury having now pumped £42bn into the railway since 2020, according to Merriman, it clearly calls the tune. Optimists remain. Darren Caplan, the chief executive of the Railway Industry Association, pointed out that passenger numbers have bounced back to more than 1.5 billion a year, heading towards 90% of the pre-pandemic high, with research from consultancy Steer forecasting that those figures could double by 2050. However, revenues trail the rebound in usage, with more lucrative business travel and commuting now a smaller share of the market, and the guaranteed income of season tickets falling away – adding up, according to the Rail Delivery Group, to a continued £54m weekly shortfall.   Related: Draft rail reform bill published ‘fittingly late’, Labour says   Bar the unions, who back full renationalisation, many hope GBR can yet carve out a better place for rail. The draft bill landed, not coincidentally, just hours before the “Bradshaw Address” – the annual railway gathering where transport secretary Mark Harper last year insisted that Downing Street and the Treasury remained fully behind GBR. Andy Bagnall, the chief executive of Rail Partners, a lobbying organisation for the train operators, opened proceedings by saying: “If we carry on like this, we will put a generation of people off travelling by rail.” More than one executive confessed they felt the industry was at its lowest point in decades. Dominic Booth, chief executive of Transport UK, lamented that there “has never been a time when operators have had their faces turned so far from the passenger”, while another executive recounted privately how his own son had laughed when he suggested he should take the train – too expensive, too unreliable was the verdict. Private train operators are eager to carve out a freer role than under their existing post-Covid contracts, the legacy of the overnight abolition of franchising when most travel was abruptly halted at the start of the pandemic. But while the firms have issues with the current regime, Labour’s policy is the one they are most anxious to hear – there is little meat yet on its bones, bar a pledge to take train operating contracts into public control as they expire. At the Bradshaw event, Merriman and his Labour shadow, Stephen Morgan, laid out pre-election pitches, albeit with Morgan constrained by the party mantra that “details of our policy will be outlined in due course”. Renationalising operators one by one is low-hanging fruit – a popular policy, cost-free and already partially enacted by necessity by a government which theoretically opposes it. Morgan did confirm that Labour’s renationalisation ambitions would not stretch to privately owned freight – or indeed the rolling stock companies which have hoovered enormous dividends out of Britain, even as the rest of the industry has been hammered by the pandemic and told to make swingeing cuts. Otherwise, the Labour pledge to “deliver the biggest reform of public transport in more than a generation” by “giving accountability back to the public”, creating “a unified rail network with passengers at the heart”, and “[ending] the fragmentation”, are phrases that have peppered many a recent minister’s speech. The railway is answering to its fourth transport secretary since reform was first signalled in 2018 – a reminder that Covid is not the only cause of its troubles. Chris Grayling commissioned the full industry review after the chaos of the timetable change in May that year, when several franchises were in a state of financial collapse. When the Williams-Shapps review was published in 2021, a well-staffed transition team, led by Network Rail’s chief executive, Andrew Haines, was tasked with establishing GBR. Further delay has seen the costs of setting up GBR rise from £205m to £381m. Now the draft bill suggests that GBR will be built squarely on Network Rail – while the secretary of state retains wide powers to intervene. Haines, for his part, said GBR “must not and can never be Network Rail 2.0 … This is a never-to-be-missed opportunity to build something new and better.” But train operators are unhappy about ceding control of the railway to the infrastructure manager, even with assurances that this is simply an initial pragmatic move to speed ahead. One source said: “He might want to change the culture, but how long has Haines got left? People remain pretty suspicious.” The likelihood remains that if the plans progress, it will be under a new government. While Labour said the draft bill had “no prospect of becoming law”, its policy – due “in weeks” – is expected to include a similar integrated “organising brain” for rail, a phrase that morphed back into the present government’s “guiding mind” when Morgan spoke this week. Despite Merriman suggesting that Labour’s alternative might be “an unaffordable state bureaucracy run for the benefit of vested interests and trade unions”, he concluded: “No matter who is in my place after an election, I hope they will deliver this rail reform – because the industry is at one in wanting it.”"

        "content": "Dairy alternatives such as I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter and Alpro’s This Is Not M*lk may have to change their names if “draconian” new rules to prevent shoppers confusing plant-based with real dairy products are imposed. With trading standards officials thought to be on the brink of issuing new guidance, including a ban on the use of words and phrases like “m*lk”, “cheeze” and “not milk” on labels, the Plant-based Food Alliance UK (PbFA) will next week make a last-ditch appeal to the environment secretary to intervene. Marisa Heath, the PbFA’s chief executive, said it would set out its concerns, which include the risk that the resulting upheaval could push up prices, in a letter to Steve Barclay. It will request that the guidance be dropped and the regulations reviewed. “At the time when we should be encouraging consumers to make more sustainable choices … this is a bad move,” said Heath, who suggested an enforcement drive would harm the wider food industry. “Major retailers will have to rename their own-brand plant-based products,” she said. “This will cause unnecessary time and financial costs in an industry that is already doing its best during the cost of living crisis. This could then have an impact on consumer prices too.” Ian Hepburn, the marketing director of Upfield UK and Ireland, which makes I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, said the spread had been in millions of fridges across Britain for nearly 35 years. “It’s implausible that anyone would be confused,” he said. “In 2023 we didn’t receive a single complaint of consumer confusion. We are baffled by these proposed restrictions which do nothing but add bureaucracy to an outdated EU law.” The latest version of the guidance, dated January 2024 and seen by the Guardian, has not been watered down despite the concerns raised by the plant-based food industry. Last year Greenpeace claimed the dairy industry had lobbied for the rules to be enforced, citing government and dairy sector documents. The so-called “draft opinion” is written by the Food Standards and Information Focus Group (FSIFG), a leading group of trading standards officers, though enforcement of the law on dairy labelling and marketing standards lies with local authorities and the trading standards officers acting on their behalf. The FSIFG explains: “Technological innovation is leading to the construction of products offered as alternatives to conventional foods of animal origin. It is important that products are clearly distinguished, understood and nutritional differences are not confused.” The document says plant-based brands should not use homophones, asterisked characters or other wordplay. Words like “whole” are also outlawed. Analysts said using fun names like m!lk or m*ilk has historically been a way to encourage people to try plant-based products. While custard creams, salad cream and cream crackers are among the foods that are exempt from the rules, the experts said terms like “soya yoghurt” and “vegan mozzarella” should not be used. Instead, they propose “soya dessert fermented with live cultures” and the literal “vegan soft-white balls with a light cheese flavour”. If the guidance is rubber-stamped when the FSIFG’s business expert group next meets, it will be shared with trading standards officers across the country. Without a change of heart, companies fear the restrictions could be in place by Easter. If they are the subject of complaint, they could face enforcement action such as having to change a brand name or packaging. Bryan Carroll, the general manager of Oatly UK and Ireland, said it was “frankly insulting” to assume people could not tell the difference. Did the UK really want to be a country with some of the “most draconian rules about how we describe our food and drink?” he added. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “This is a draft opinion from a group who are independent of government. There are no plans to change existing legislation in this area.”"

        "content": "Nvidia hit a stock market valuation of $2tn on Friday as the US chipmaker capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom. An extraordinary surge of the company’s shares had already propelled it past Amazon and Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, to become the third largest in America. But another blockbuster earnings report – in which Nvidia blew past Wall Street’s expectations with a 265% jump in sales – sparked a fresh rally this week. It took more than two decades for the Santa Clara, California-based company to hit a valuation of $1tn on the market. Less than nine months later, Nvidia reached $2tn. Shares in the group began climbing on Friday when New York opened for trading, allowing it to fleetingly scale the milestone. They later faded, however, and finished the day up 0.4%, with a valuation of about $1.97tn. The benchmark S&P 500 also cleared 5,100 for the first time during early trading, before slipping back. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at fresh record highs, however, as Wall Street continues to scale new peaks. Nvidia is at the heart of the AI gold rush, with those developing the technology relying heavily on its wares. Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Meta and Google have all struck deals to purchase the firm’s chips in bulk as they scramble to release new AI products and features. This remarkable acceleration in demand has turbocharged Nvidia’s business, with the group’s most closely watched profit figure – revenue from data centers – up by more than 400% in the last quarter, at $18.4bn. Jensen Huang, its founder and CEO, hailed a “tipping point” for faster computing generative AI as the company published its latest earnings report on Wednesday. Nvidia’s financial performance, and the broader demand for its shares, has become seen as bellwethers for overall interest in AI. Since the turn of the year, the company’s stock has soared by more than 60%. Expectations around its growth trajectory have been stoked by Nvidia’s plans to ship a new chip, the B100, at the highest end of its product line later this year. Some key players, like OpenAI’s Sam Altman, are holding talks on plans for rival AI chip ventures. Huang and Nvidia “have essentially cracked the code and sparked a generational tech transformation that investors are trying to get their arms around”, Dan Ives, technology analyst at Wedbush, said. “The AI Revolution starts with Nvidia and in our view the AI party and popcorn is just getting started.” The wider industry has not experienced a revolution of this scale in decades, according to Ives, who described AI – and Nvidia’s role in powering its development – as a “transformational tech trend we have not seen since the start of the internet in the mid-90s”."

The firm’s objection to comments by a member of a Senate inquiry examining its conduct come after weeks of intense criticism and accusations it repeatedly misled parliament over its use of so-called power maps, which identify influential decision makers within departments. KPMG Australia was asked to provide advice to the home affairs department in 2017 before it awarded $423m to security contractor Paladin for work on Manus Island. The closed contract has been the subject of scrutiny ever since, including a recent investigation by former Asio boss Dennis Richardson. During the final public hearing of the Senate inquiry on Friday, Labor senator Deborah O’Neill accused the firm of an “incredible failure” when advising the government on the outsourcing of security services. “An EY audit shows that KPMG investigated the wrong Paladin entity,” O’Neill told officials from Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, an oversight body. “I’m watching jaws proverbially hit the floor as you hear me tell you this, because that is an incredible failure.”  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The EY audit of the Paladin procurement, published in 2019, found KPMG Australia provided a financial assessment of Paladin Solutions, a PNG-based company, rather than Paladin Holdings, a Singapore-based company that was awarded the contract. KPMG PNG had a business relationship with the PNG-based company. “The financial strength assessment report obtained by the department is not relevant to the financial strength of its contracted service provider – Paladin Holdings,” the EY audit said. “The department noted that Paladin Holdings did not have financial statements.”   Related: Consultancy firms divided on controversial tax scheme as ATO threatens action   When asked for a response to senator O’Neill’s criticism, a KPMG spokesperson said: “We did not conduct the assessment on the wrong entity.” “[The EY review] found KPMG conducted the financial strength assessment on ‘Paladin Solutions’ at the request of the commonwealth, based on the financial statements provided to the department,” the spokesperson said. During a Senate estimates hearing last week, O’Neill also accused the firm of “a failure” to manage a conflict of interest. But a KPMG spokesperson said the EY report found it “declared the PNG firm’s business relationship with Paladin Solutions to Home Affairs”. However, the EY audit also found “there was no specific records of the department assessing and agreeing to this conflict declaration”. The report also criticised the veracity of KPMG Australia’s report to government, which warned Paladin Solutions was a “moderate/high risk”. “The Financial Strength Assessment of Paladin Solutions PNG ltd report by the commercial advisors was based on information extracted from unaudited financial statements, without a statement of cash flows,” the EY report said. KPMG’s defence comes as the Senate inquiry prepares to make recommendations for tougher regulation of the sector and after criticism from senator O’Neill and Greens senator Barbara Pocock. The firm was criticised after initially telling the Senate inquiry that it did not produce maps of government departments that identify influential public servants, before being provided with evidence that it did. Earlier this month, KPMG Australia’s chief executive, Andrew Yates, apologised to the inquiry for taking a “too literal” approach to senator O’Neill’s question about power maps. Senator Pocock was not convinced by the apology. “You have lied to us,” Pocock told an estimates hearing on 9 February. “That’s my view. You’ve lied to us more than once. You’ve misled us perhaps four times and probably more times that I don’t know about.” Yates told the inquiry that was not his intention."

        "content": "Britain’s data watchdog has ordered a Serco subsidary to stop using facial recognition technology and fingerprint scanning to monitor the attendance of staff at the leisure centres it operates. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) found that the biometric data of more than 2,000 employees had been unlawfully processed at 38 centres managed by Serco Leisure to check up on their attendance. In its investigation, the ICO found facial recognition technology had been used at all 38 facilities, two of which also operated fingerprint scanning systems. The watchdog has issued enforcement notices ordering Serco Leisure to stop processing biometric data for monitoring employees’ attendance and destroy all biometric data it is not legally obliged to retain within three months. It is the first time the ICO has taken enforcement action against an employer to stop it processing the biometric data of staff. The watchdog said Serco had failed to show why it was necessary or proportionate to use fingerprint scanning or facial recognition instead of ID cards or fobs to clock in and out of work. Staff had not proactively been offered an alternative to having their faces and fingerprints scanned, the ICO said. There is growing concern about employers using facial recognition technology and other surveillance tools to monitor staff. The TUC warned in 2022 that the use of intrusive surveillance tech and artificial intelligence risked “spiralling out of control” without stronger regulation to protect workers. In 2020, Barclays scrapped an employee-tracking system that monitored when bankers were at their desks and sent warnings to those on breaks. The ICO has previously taken enforcement action in relation to biometric data and facial recognition. In May 2022, the watchdog fined the US-based Clearview AI £7.5m and ordered the data of UK residents be deleted from its systems after finding “serious breaches” of data protection law. Clearview AI successfully appealed against the ICO decision last year. John Edwards, the UK information commissioner, said on Friday that Serco Leisure had not fully considered the risks before introducing biometric technology. “There is no clear way for staff to opt out of the system, increasing the power imbalance in the workplace and putting people in a position where they feel like they have to hand over their biometric data to work there,” he said. Edwards said the ICO would intervene if it believed data was being used unlawfully. It has updated guidance for organisations considering using people’s biometric data. Welcoming the enforcement notice, Madeleine Stone of the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: “Banning Serco Leisure from using facial recognition to track their staff is a welcome intervention from the ICO, but this represents a drop in the ocean given how common biometric surveillance is becoming in both workplaces and in public spaces across the country.”  The ICO’s investigation covered Serco Leisure, Serco Jersey and seven associated community leisure trusts. Serco Leisure said: “This technology was introduced at the leisure centres we manage nearly five years ago to make clocking-in and out easier and simpler for colleagues. “We engaged with our team members in advance of its rollout and its introduction was well received by colleagues. The introduction also followed external legal advice which said use of the technology was permitted.” The company added: “Despite being aware of Serco Leisure’s use of this technology for some years, the ICO have only this week issued an enforcement notice and requested that we take action. We now understand this coincides with the publication of new guidance for organisations on processing of biometric data which we anticipate will provide greater clarity in this area. “We take this matter seriously and confirm we will fully comply with the enforcement notice.”  The company is a subsidiary of Serco Group and manages 47 leisure centres, employing 2,500 staff."

        "content": "Nationwide building society has put more than 300 people’s jobs at risk in the lender’s third round of cuts over the past 12 months as bosses push ahead with a major restructuring plan. A letter sent to staff by Nationwide’s employee union, and seen by the Guardian, explains that the latest redundancies will affect workers across its retail service, customer resolutions, support and retail-risk divisions. The changes will put 305 people at risk of redundancy, and ultimately lead to about 125 job cuts, in a move that is meant to “align operations to where customer needs are greatest, provide greater clarity of roles, and simpler reporting lines”, the letter said. It appears to be part of a drip-feeding of bad news for Nationwide’s almost 13,000-strong workforce, and takes total job losses over the past year to nearly 800. That includes the 200 staff who lost their jobs as part of redundancies announced shortly before the Christmas holidays, and 450 last spring. In December, its chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, also rescinded a “work anywhere” policy launched under her predecessor, Joe Garner, during the Covid pandemic. The changes, introduced last month, mean that staff have to be in the office for at least 40% of their contract – two days a week for a full-time employee. The job cuts come as Nationwide undergoes a wider company overhaul, which bosses say is necessary for the lender to “become a modern mutual, respond to customer needs and future proof the building society”, the union letter said. Commenting on the latest round of cuts, a Nationwide spokesperson said its bosses “have worked hard to keep the number of affected colleagues to a minimum and are ensuring we provide the right support for those impacted. Wherever possible, we are offering suitable roles to the people impacted by these changes, or the opportunity to apply for an alternative role.” The building society has been holding staff consultations over the latest redundancy plans since early February. If the plans go ahead, affected staff will be given their final notice in early May, with anyone affected expected to leave the business by early June.   Related: Nationwide’s Dominic West ad prompts complaint from rival   The Nationwide spokesperson added: “Our strategy is to give customers great value products, choice in the way they bank with us, and the best possible service.” Founded as the Southern Co-operative Permanent building society in 1884, the lender became Nationwide in 1970 and has grown into a group with more than 600 branches, which it has committed to keeping open until at least 2026 amid mass closures by rivals."

The shares rose more than 4% shortly after the opening bell, valuing the company as much as $2.05trn, and are now up 3.8%. The company has gone from a market cap of $1trn to $2trn in a record eight months – less than half the time it took tech giants Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia posted record revenues on Wednesday after the closing bell, driving its shares 16.4% higher yesterday, which added $277bn to its market value – Wall Street’s largest one-day gain on record. It is benefiting from strong demand for its chips that made the Californian firm a pioneer of the artificial intelligence boom. US stock markets made moderate gains in early trading today after soaring yesterday, when the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day in more than a year in New York, rising 2.1% amid a global equities rally. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained 3%.   Related: Wall Street’s S&P 500 and Japan’s Nikkei hit record highs amid AI boom   The energy price cap in Great Britain will fall by £238 to £1,690 this spring thanks to a mild winter and lower gas prices, easing pressure on household finances. Set by energy regulator Ofgem, the cap reflects the average annual bill for 29 million households in England, and takes effect from April. It is a 12.3% reduction from £1,928 in the current quarter. In a boost to the poorest households, Ofgem also confirmed it would equalise standing charges – the set fee paid before any gas or electricity is used - meaning customers with prepayment meters will no longer be charged more for their connection than those on credit or direct debit. Wholesale gas prices have fallen as a mild winter in Europe reduced demand, helped by plentiful supplies of liquified natural gas in Europe and Asia, leading to a fall in household bills.

Have a fab weekend. We’ll be back next week. Take care! – JK  Updated at 3.19pm GMT    3.08pm GMT   Paula Vennells, the former chief executive of the Post Office, has been formally stripped of her CBE by the King for “bringing the honours system into disrepute”. She had previously said would hand back her CBE, an ignominious end to a career that will be remembered for her organisation’s relentless run of wrongful prosecutions against more than 900 post office operators. Last year, Alan Bates, the operator who led the campaign to expose the Horizon IT scandal and whose story has now been told in an ITV drama, turned down an OBE, making the point that it would be “inappropriate” while victims still suffered and Vennells retained her accolade. She was awarded her CBE for services to the Post Office and charity at the start of 2019, shortly before she stepped down – ending a seven-year period as chief executive during which she collected more than £4.5m in pay.     2.49pm GMT  Nvidia hits $2 trillion valuation, riding high on AI boom  The US chipmaker Nvidia, riding high on the AI boom, has just hit a market valuation of $2 trillion. The shares rose 4.3%, valuing the company at $2.05trn. Yesterday, the shares jumped 16.4% in New York, adding $277bn to the Californian firm’s market value. It reported bumper results after the closing bell on Wednesday, sparking a rally on the Nasdaq in New York, and other stock markets around the world. Japan’s Nikkei achieved an all-time closing high yesterday. Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang said on Wednesday he believed the world was at an AI “tipping point” and said demand for the group’s microchips was “surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations”. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 54 points, or 0.3%, when Wall Street opened, while the S&P 500 went through 5,100 for the first time, rising 15 points, or 0.3%, to 5,102.  Updated at 3.02pm GMT    2.31pm GMT  UK voters oppose tax cuts if this means spending cuts – poll  UK voters oppose tax cuts that would force the government to cut public services, according to a poll that unites Tory and Labour supporters. In a poll ahead of the budget next month, 64% of voters said they oppose tax cuts if they result in cuts to spending on public services. The poll by Opinium for the Fairness Foundation shows that 33% of UK voters support keeping taxes as they are, while 31% said they wanted the government to raise taxes. Only 16% wanted tax cuts if it meant cutting public services. Only 16% of the British public supported cutting taxes and spending less on public services. Even among Conservatives, the 17% of voters who back tax cuts were outnumbered by those who want to see public spending maintained (50%) or increased (23%). Jeremy Hunt is expected to offer tax cuts in his budget on 6 March. The chancellor has hinted that his room for manoeuvre will be limited, forcing him to search for efficiency savings and spending reductions across Whitehall to make further funds available. Respondents said they were also concerned about wealthy people avoiding higher rates of tax. A majority (53%) backed a minimum 35% tax rate for those earning more than £100,000. The foundation said it asked this question after it was revealed that Rishi Sunak paid the same tax rate as a teacher on his total income last year due to lower rates of tax on income earned from wealth.     2.19pm GMT  ECB must resist early rate cut temptation – Nagel  In Frankfurt, a European Central Bank policymaker has urged caution about cutting interest rates, and said the bank can only consider a potential reduction once it has inflation data for the second quarter. Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel said eurozone inflation remains stubbornly high so the ECB should not rush into reducing borrowing costs. Inflation edged down to 2.8% in January from 2.9% in December, above the central bank’s 2% target. The ECB has kept interest rates at a record high since September and pushed back on rate cut talk despite market hopes for an early reduction. Financial markets are now pricing in the first move in June. Nagel said in a speech:  Even though it may be very tempting, it is too early to cut interest rates. We will only receive a more detailed picture of how domestic price pressures are unfolding during the second quarter. Then we can contemplate a cut in interest rates.      2.13pm GMT   The US chipmaker Nvidia, riding high on the AI boom, could hit a market valuation of $2 trillion when Wall Street opens in about 20 minutes.  The shares are up more than 2% in pre-market trading, valuing the company at $1.96trn. Yesterday, the shares jumped 16.4% in New York, adding $277bn to the Californian firm’s market value, as investors were cheered by stellar revenue growth reported after the closing bell on Wednesday. This triggered a rally on the Nasdaq in New York, and other stock markets around the world. Japan’s Nikkei achieved an all-time closing high yesterday.   Related: Wall Street’s S&P 500 and Japan’s Nikkei hit record highs amid AI boom       2.03pm GMT  European gas prices at pre-energy crisis low  European gas prices have fallen to their lowest levels since spring 2021, sparking hopes that the energy crisis of the last three years may be coming to an end. Warmer-than-usual winter weather, strong imports of liquefied natural gas and lower demand caused by high prices in recent years mean that gas stored in European underground storage is at high levels – and driving prices lower. The European gas March benchmark fell to as low as €22.34 per megawatt hour this morning, the lowest since May 2021, and is on track for a third weekly decline. British Gas prices fell more than 2% earlier, and are now down 1.4% at 56.49p per therm. In August, they jumped to 640p per therm. The energy crisis started in 2021 when a long cold winter left Europe with low natural gas storage levels. Prices shot up after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 when it squeezed gas supplies, but even before, Russia was sending less gas to Europe, perhaps to pressure Germany and other governments to approve the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline (which was shelved just after Russia invaded Ukraine). Prices soared over €300 per megawatt hour in August 2022, and then fell back as Europe switched towards liquefied natural gas.     12.31pm GMT  ‘We won’t be remote-controlled’: how German football fans took on investors and won  Toy cars mounted with flares and other stunts have disrupted Bundesliga matches. Now fans’ dogged defiance appears to have paid off, our Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly reports. They have hurled tennis balls and chocolate coins on to the pitch; they have disrupted play with remote-control cars and planes mounted with smoke bombs. In recent months German football fans have thrown almost everything they have into protests aimed at preventing foreign investors from increasing control of their much-loved clubs. This week it appeared their dogged defiance, driven by deep-seated grassroots sentiment, had paid off, after the German football league (DFL), which runs the Bundesliga, dropped its plans to sell an estimated €1bn (£850m) stake in its media rights income to a private equity firm. The league’s board said it would no longer go ahead with the deal, in the hope, it said, of ending the unprecedented wave of protests, which have disrupted almost every game in the top two male divisions of German football since the start of 2024. The stunts have led to lengthy delays, even match cancellations, which bosses said were a threat to the integrity of German football. For fans, though, they were a winning gameplan that pulled off an unlikely victory. Comparing the struggle to that of David and Goliath, the fan group Unsere Kurve (Our Stands) celebrated the decision, and noted: “Ultimately the key to this success were these comprehensive, and very peaceful and creative protests.”   Related: ‘We won’t be remote-controlled’: how German football fans took on investors and won        12.26pm GMT  UK watchdog orders Serco to stop using facial recognition, fingerprint scanning to monitor staff  The outsourcing company Serco has been ordered to stop using facial recognition technology (FRT) and fingerprint scanning to monitor staff’s attendance in its leisure business. Britain’s data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, carried out an investigation that found Serco Leisure, Serco Jersey and seven associated community leisure trusts have been unlawfully processing the biometric data of more than 2,000 employees at 38 leisure facilities, for attendance checks and subsequent payment for their time.  Serco provides defence, security, immigration, health and transport services for the UK and other governments. Shares in the London-listed company fell 1.4% today. The ICO said:  They failed to show why it is necessary or proportionate to use FRT and fingerprint scanning for this purpose, when there are less intrusive means available such as ID cards or fobs. Employees have not been proactively offered an alternative to having their faces and fingers scanned to clock in and out of their place of work, and it has been presented as a requirement in order to get paid. Due to the imbalance of power between Serco Leisure and its employees, it is unlikely that they would feel able to say no to the collection and use of their biometric data for attendance checks.  Serco has also been ordered to destroy all biometric data that it is not legally obliged to retain. This must be done within three months. John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said:  Biometric data is wholly unique to a person so the risks of harm in the event of inaccuracies or a security breach are much greater - you can’t reset someone’s face or fingerprint like you can reset a password.  Serco Leisure did not fully consider the risks before introducing biometric technology to monitor staff attendance, prioritising business interests over its employees’ privacy. There is no clear way for staff to opt out of the system, increasing the power imbalance in the workplace and putting people in a position where they feel like they have to hand over their biometric data to work there.  This is neither fair nor proportionate under data protection law, and, as the UK regulator, we will closely scrutinise organisations and act decisively if we believe biometric data is being used unlawfully.  He said this action “serves to put industry on notice that biometric technologies cannot be deployed lightly”. A spokesperson for the company told Reuters that the technology was introduced nearly five years following external legal advice and that it was “well-received” by staff, but added:  We take this matter seriously and confirm we will fully comply with the enforcement notice.      12.06pm GMT  US man accused of making $1.8m from listening in on wife’s remote work calls  US regulators have accused a man of making $1.8m (£1.4m) by trading on confidential information he overheard while his wife was on a remote call, in a case that could fuel arguments against working from home. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it charged Tyler Loudon with insider trading after he “took advantage of his remote working conditions” and profited from private information related to the oil firm BP’s plans to buy an Ohio-based travel centre and truck-stop business last year. The SEC claims that Loudon, who is based in Houston, Texas, listened in on several remote calls held by his wife, a BP merger and acquisitions manager who had been working on the planned deal in a home office 20ft (6 metres) away. The regulator said Loudon went on a buying spree, purchasing more than 46,000 shares in the takeover target, TravelCentres, without his wife’s knowledge, weeks before the deal was announced on 16 February 2023. TravelCentres of America’s stock soared by nearly 71% after the deal was announced. Loudon then sold off all of his shares, making a $1.8m profit. Loudon eventually confessed to his wife, and claimed that he had bought the shares because he wanted to make enough money so that she did not have to work long hours anymore. She reported his dealings to her bosses at BP, which later fired her despite having no evidence that she knowingly leaked information to her husband. She eventually moved out of the couple’s home and filed for divorce.   Related: US man accused of making $1.8m from listening in on wife’s remote work calls       11.59am GMT   Returning to the new energy price cap in Great Britain, Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, explains what the changes mean.  The cap dictates the price the huge majority of homes in England, Scotland and Wales pay for energy (so that’s you unless you’re on a fixed or special tariff) as most firms just charge the max. It moves every three months, mostly based on average wholesale rates, yet there’s a time lag – for example, this April to June Cap is based on November to February rates. The new rates for 1 April have just been announced. In a nutshell, for every £100 a Direct Debit user spends on energy today, they’ll pay £87.70 for it from 1 April. So it’s an improvement, and predictions are it’ll drop again in July, though overall prices are still too expensive, nearly double the price of the cheapest pre-crisis fixes.   His main takeaways are: 1. Prepay will become the cheapest way to pay. Prepay standing charges have been lowered to equalise them with direct debit, yet as prepay unit rates are cheaper, that means overall for a typical user from April, prepay will be about 3% cheaper. The most vulnerable households often use prepayment meters and it has always been a rip off, so this is a staggering turnaround. Those on the price cap will see a saving by moving to a prepayment meter – yet that doesn’t necessarily mean everyone should switch to one. If and when proper competition returns (see point 3) there are rarely any prepay deals – firms mostly focus on winning new Direct Debit customers, so it is likely Direct Debit deals will be cheapest for those who switch and prepayment will be cheapest for those that don’t. 2. The energy bill poll tax will get worse. Standing charges for Direct Debit will rise to £334/year (from £303 now). Even though overall bills will fall, standing charges won’t. Full details on unit rates and standing charges can be found here.Standing charges are a form of poll tax as you pay it regardless of usage and a moral hazard as those on lower usage get less benefit and are disincentivised from cutting bills. Ofgem is currently reviewing standing charges and we will be pushing it to make changes for the July price cap. 3. Switching deals may be kicked into action for 1 April as Ofgem’s changing one of the two background rules that stop it (it should have changed both). From 1 April, Ofgem is ending the ‘Market Stabilisation Charge’ (MSC) regime it set up during the energy crisis, which means if you switch firm to cut the cost, the new company must compensate your old company if it’s offering a cheap deal because wholesale rates are cheaper. This has effectively blocked most firms from offering cheap switchers’ deals, and why paltry saving ‘existing customer only’ deals have been dominating. So I am delighted to hear it is going, and hope it will at last spur real competition to drive down prices. Yet Ofgem has extended its other market restricting rule which bans ‘acquisition only’ tariffs for another year (though it may review that sooner). In other words, firms must offer existing customers the same deal as new customers (existing customers can still get different deals).In normal times I could support this. Yet at the moment when most firms are simply sitting on their existing customers, letting them languish on the price cap I think we should be stimulating competition as much as possible.  4. The British Gas Price Promise deal doesn’t look as good as it did. It’s currently 12% cheaper than the market but promises to be £1 less than the April price cap, and now that won’t be as big a change (Cornwall Insight had been predicting a 15% cut). In which case, if you want to fix to get price certainty, then there are cheaper deals. To see a full list and analysis of what’s available, see Lewis’s Should you fix my energy or stay on the Price Cap? guide. 5. You can undercut the price cap by 3%.  The Eon Next Pledge tariff, which you can switch to, charges roughly 3% less than the Price Cap for the first year. To get it, you need to be on direct debit and have or get a smart meter. So if that works for you, and you’re planning to stick on the price cap, it’s a no brainer.      11.33am GMT  Huge cybersecurity leak lifts lid on world of China’s hackers for hire  A big leak of data from a Chinese cybersecurity firm has revealed state security agents paying tens of thousands of pounds to harvest data on targets, including foreign governments, while hackers hoover up huge amounts of information on any person or institution who might be of interest to their prospective clients. The cache of more than 500 leaked files from the Chinese firm I-Soon was posted on the developer website Github and is thought by cybersecurity experts to be genuine. Some of the targets discussed include Nato and the UK Foreign Office. The leak provides an unprecedented insight into the world of China’s hackers for hire, which the head of the UK’s security services has called a “massive” challenge for the country.   Related: Huge cybersecurity leak lifts lid on world of China’s hackers for hire   The files, which are a mixture of chat logs, company prospectuses and data samples, reveal the extent of China’s intelligence gathering operations, while also highlighting the market pressures felt by the country’s commercial hackers as they vie for business in a struggling economy. I-Soon appears to have worked with – and later been embroiled in a commercial dispute with – another Chinese hacking outfit, Chengdu 404, whose hackers have been indicted by the US Department of Justice for cyber-attacks on companies in the US as well as pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, among other targets. Other targets discussed in the I-Soon leaks include the British thinktank Chatham House and the public health bureaux and foreign affairs ministries of Asean countries. Some of this data seems to have been gathered on spec, while in other cases there are specific contracts with a Chinese public security bureau to gather a certain type of data.     11.32am GMT   Apple has condemned Spotify over the long-running competition complaint filed with the EU that could see the tech company face a huge fine if found guilty. After reports the bloc has concluded its investigation into the music streaming service’s claims of anti-competitive behaviour by Apple over its App Store rules, with the prospect of a €500m (£425m) fine, the iPhone manufacturer has accused Spotify of trying to get “limitless” access to its tools without paying.

A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday disclosed the financial performance of the social media group, and revealed that Sam Altman, the OpenAI founder and CEO, is its third-largest shareholder, with an 8.7% stake. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.” Its much-awaited listing – expected in March – would be the biggest social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019. The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, Reddit said in a statement.

The Munich-based Ifo institute’s closely-followed business climate index rose to 85.5 points in February, from 85.2 points in January as sentiment among services firms improved. Clemens Fuest, the institute’s president, said:  This is due to slightly less pessimistic expectations. Assessments of the current situation remained unchanged – positive and negative responses here were nearly in balance. The German economy is stabilising at a low level.  In manufacturing, the business climate index fell, and perception of the current situation is at its lowest since September 2020. The decline in the order backlog continued, and companies announced further cuts to production.However, in the service sector, the business climate improved. Service providers were more satisfied with their current business situation. Expectations were still pessimistic, but less so than they were in January. Orders remain weak, though.In trade, the index dropped again. Companies were noticeably less satisfied with their current business situation, although their expectations improved slightly. They are still deeply skeptical of how business will develop in the months ahead.In construction, the business climate indicator rose slightly, but remains at a low level. While the current situation has improved, expectations for the coming months fell to their lowest level since 1991.     10.10am GMT  How Ukraine’s largest private equity firm raised $350m during a war  How Ukraine’s largest private equity firm raised $350m during a war – by the Guardian’s deputy business editor Juliette Garside. For Lenna Koszarny, the Canadian-born head of Ukraine’s largest private equity group, Horizon Capital, there was never any question of stopping work or leaving the country when Russia launched its February 2022 assault. But continuing to do business took resolve. “You’re in the centre of a hurricane,” she said. There have been 7,400 missile and 3,900 drone attacks on Ukraine since the war began, and working through them is part of daily life. “The air raid sirens go off, you go into the bomb shelter, you take your computer … and you keep working until the all-clear comes.” There have been no casualties on her team. It’s a different story for the 18 companies Horizon invests in – a third of employees have been killed. And yet Horizon, which manages $1.6bn (£1.26bn) in assets, has remained open throughout. “We haven’t shut the offices one day since the invasion.” The company’s 35 staff relocated to Lviv, near the border with Poland, for a few weeks at the start of the invasion, but Koszarny and her team soon returned to Kyiv and have remained in the capital throughout.   Related: How Ukraine’s largest private equity firm raised $350m during a war   Horizon has managed to not only keep its doors open and its employees safe, but to raise $350m in a funding round that originally began in October 2021. After a delay caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion, fundraising resumed, and the cap was raised from $200m to $300m, and then raised again, in a process that closed this month. It will be the first and largest private equity fund raised during the conflict. Backers include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Rockefeller Foundation. Amid the bombardment, talk of capital raising can feel out of place. But Ukraine’s ability to keep its economy afloat and continue exporting is crucial to the war effort.     9.59am GMT  Standard Chartered CEO’s pay jumps to £7.8m after profit bump  Rounding off the UK bank earnings season, Standard Chartered has handed its chief executive his largest pay package in nearly a decade as the lender reported a jump in profits, despite bracing for up to £1bn in potential losses due to China’s property downturn. The profit bump helped push the longstanding chief executive Bill Winters’ pay up 22% to £7.8m – from £6.4m in 2022. It is the most he has been paid since 2015. The London-headquartered bank, which makes most of its profits in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, said annual pre-tax profits rose by 19% in 2023, rising to $5.1bn (£4bn). Standard Chartered shares are top of the FTSE 100 index, up 8.2%. The growth was due in part to high interest rates, which allowed it to charge more for loans and mortgages. It said revenue from those interest charges, compared to what it paid out to savers, was expected to grow in 2024 “and beyond”.   Related: Standard Chartered chief’s pay jumps 22% to £7.8m after profit bump   The stronger performance helped offset the money that the bank put aside for potential losses. The lender is ultimately expecting a loss of up to $1.2bn linked to its Chinese commercial real estate portfolio, though the actual charges taken for the year were offset by improvements in other parts of the business, and totalled $528m. Standard Chartered also took a $153m hit in the value of its stake in China Bohai Bank, as Chinese lenders have become increasingly exposed to bad debts linked to its property crisis. Winters’ pay award outstrips every other year since he has led the bank apart from his first year, in 2015, when the 62-year-old’s pay package was flattered by a buyout award and totalled £8.4m. This week, rival HSBC nearly doubled the payout for its own chief executive, Noel Quinn, to £10.6m.  Updated at 10.07am GMT    9.15am GMT  UK consumer confidence dips in February  Over here in the UK, consumer confidence faltered in February, as people fretted about the outlook for the economy, which was in recession at the end of last year. The closely followed monthly GfK consumer confidence survey, which has been running since January 1974, came out overnight. After an improvement in December and January, the February index dipped unexpectedly from -19 to -21, worse than economists’ forecasts.  The only component of the index not to fall was households’ expectations for their personal finances over the coming year, which was unchanged at zero. GfK’s client strategy director, Joe Staton, said:  This metric is key to understanding the financial mood of the nation because confident householders are more likely to spend despite the cost-of-living crisis.  Philip Nothard, customer insight & strategy director at Cox Automotive UK, tweeted:  Despite a slight decline in February's GfK - An NIQ Company consumer confidence index to -21, overall confidence has risen significantly over the past year due to improving real wage growth and easing mortgage cost concerns.— Philip Nothard (@PhilipN_Auto) February 23, 2024      9.07am GMT  German economy hit by investment slump in Q4  In other news, the German economy shrank by 0.3% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three months, hit by a slump in investment. This is unchanged from preliminary estimates, the statistics office Destatis said. The decline came after Europe’s biggest economy stalled in the third quarter. Household expenditure increased by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, while investment fell, by 1.7% in construction and by 3.5% in machinery and equipment. Trade was also a drag, with exports of goods and services down 1.6%.  On a brighter note, the production of motor vehicles and trailers increased, bucking a declining trend across the manufacturing sector. Economic journalist Holger Zschäpitz tweeted:  Good Morning from #Germany where fewer & fewer companies seem to want to invest.  GDP was dragged down by a slump in investment in Q4 — putting Europe’s biggest economy on course for 1st recession since pandemic. Investment in machinery plunged by a whopping 3.5% QoQ.… pic.twitter.com/MUAgPLqP5C— Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 23, 2024      8.42am GMT  Ofgem announces temporary additional £28 payment to struggling households  Ofgem isn’t just lowering the price cap, which translates into lower energy bills in Great Britain as wholesale costs have fallen.  Among other measures, households on prepayment meters will no longer pay a higher standing charge than those on direct debit or standard credit. This means metered consumers will save about £49 annually, while direct debit customers will pay £10 more each year. There is also a temporary additional payment to those who are struggling. My colleague Alex Lawson explains: The regulator said it had adjusted the calculation of the cap to allow a temporary additional payment of £28 a year to make sure suppliers had “sufficient funds to support customers who are struggling”. The charge will be added to the bills of customers who pay by direct debit and not those on prepayment meters. It will be partly offset by the end of an £11 a year charge that was added to cover debts related to the pandemic.     8.31am GMT  Falling energy bills to lower inflation and make summer rate cut possible – ING  Tumbling UK energy bills will help take headline inflation below 1.5% in June, and make a summer interest rate cut possible, says James Smith, developed markets economist at ING. He is predicting the first rate reduction in August.  UK energy prices will fall by 12% in April and it’s likely the regulator will lower the price cap again in July. That’s set to take headline inflation below 2% in April and we think it will stay below the Bank of England’s target for much - if not all - of 2024. That should help unlock a summer rate cut, if coupled with progress on services inflation and wage growth.  He thinks these factors will push headline inflation below the Bank of England’s 2% target in April to 1.9%, and it could go as low as 1.4% in June. Household energy alone will be shaving 1.3 percentage points off headline CPI during the second quarter, but by the end of the second quarter, much lower food and core goods inflation will make a material difference, too.  So what does this all mean for the prospect of rate cuts? Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey caught the headlines this week by emphasising that inflation doesn’t need to be back to target for the Bank to cut rates. That obviously shouldn’t be taken literally given what headline CPI is likely to do in the second quarter, and what the Bank is really wanting to see is greater progress on services inflation and private-sector wage growth over the next few months. The Bank is forecasting services CPI to fall from 6.5% to 4.9% in June, something we broadly agree with, and we expect to see further gradual downward pressure through the summer. A lot of this near-term stickiness is down to rental inflation, which still appears to be intensifying, as well as the impact of annual “CPI plus” index-linked price rises for things like phone contracts and the internet. But dig a little deeper, and the news does seem to be slowly improving. If we look at catering for instance, which we think is a decent gauge of genuine domestically-generated, persistent inflation in the services basket, momentum has been slowing for several months. We think this is in part down to the lagged effects of the fall in natural gas prices, which when they rose originally, had put huge upward pressure on costs in an area of the economy with a high concentration of smaller businesses.      7.56am GMT   Emily Seymour, energy editor of the consumer group Which?, has this advice for consumers:   Some fixed deals are currently available for close to the predicted April price cap but most of these deals will save consumers very little when it comes into force. With the price cap predicted to remain fairly stable for the rest of 2024, more competitive deals may become available in the coming months. Consumers can use switching services - like Which? Switch Energy - to keep an eye out for any new fixed deals that might offer savings on the April price cap. As a rule of thumb, we wouldn’t recommend fixing a contract longer than 12 months, higher than the April price cap or with significant exit fees - in case circumstances change and you want to switch to a better deal.      7.55am GMT   The Resolution Foundation, a respected think tank, has done its analysis of what the new price cap means for households.  Household energy bills are on track to fall by a quarter this year – but are still up by more than a quarter on pre-crisis levels - @FryEmily responds to the latest @ofgem price cap with new RF analysis https://t.co/OlbpPGyChS pic.twitter.com/NCETZkwPRT— Resolution Foundation (@resfoundation) February 23, 2024      7.19am GMT   Ed Miliband MP, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said:   Whilst it is welcome the price cap is coming down, the truth is that energy bills are still far too high for hardworking families. Rishi’s recession means Britain is paying the price for 14 years of Conservative failure. From banning onshore wind, to crashing the markets for offshore wind and solar, Conservative energy policy has failed. Only Labour can bring down energy bills once and for all, with our plan to switch on Great British Energy, a homegrown clean power company for our country.      7.16am GMT   Wholesale gas prices have fallen as a mild winter in Europe reduced demand, helped by plentiful supplies of liquified natural gas in Europe and Asia, leading to a fall in household bills. Here is our full story:   Related: Energy price cap in Great Britain to fall to £1,690 from April    Updated at 8.37am GMT    7.15am GMT   Ofgem said the cost of living remains high and many customers continue to struggle with their bills, as standing charges rise and energy debt reaches a record figure of £3.1bn. Therefore, today Ofgem also announced:  Confirmation of the levelisation of standing charges to remove the ‘PPM premium’ previously incurred by prepayment customers. A decision to allow a temporary adjustment to the price cap to address supplier costs related to increased levels of bad debt. A decision to extend the ban on acquisition-only tariffs for up to another 12 months, the practice of offering cheaper deals exclusively to new customers. Confirmation of the end of the Market Stabilisation Charge (MSC) from 1 April. The charge temporarily requires all domestic suppliers acquiring a domestic customer to pay a charge to the losing supplier, when wholesale prices fall considerably below the relevant wholesale price cap index. A decision not to change wholesale cost allowances following a review conducted in late 2023.   Updated at 8.39am GMT    7.10am GMT  Introduction: Average annual fuel bill to fall 12% to £1,690 under price cap, but ‘6m households trapped in fuel poverty  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. The average annual dual fuel energy bill in in Great Britain will fall by 12% to £1,690 from 1 April, under a new price cap announced by the regulator Ofgem. The price cap, which sets a maximum rate per unit that can be charged to customers for their energy use, will fall by 12.3% on the previous quarter from 1 April to 30 June. For an average household paying by direct debit for dual fuel, this equates to £1,690, a drop of £238 over the course of a year – saving around £20 a month. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem’s chief executive, said:  This is good news to see the price cap drop to its lowest level in more than two years – and to see energy bills for the average household drop by £690 since the peak of the crisis – but there are still big issues that we must tackle head-on to ensure we build a system that’s more resilient for the long term and fairer to customers. That’s why we are levelising standing charges to end the inequity of people with prepayment meters, many of whom are vulnerable and struggling, being charged more up-front for their energy than other customers. We also need to address the risk posed by stubbornly high levels of debt in the system, so we must introduce a temporary payment to help prevent an unsustainable situation leading to higher bills in the future. We’ll be stepping back to look at issues surrounding debt and affordability across market for struggling consumers, which we’ll be announcing soon.  Campaigners say this won’t stop 6m households from being trapped in fuel poverty. The charity National Energy Action says the typical bill is is still more than £400 a year more than it was in October 2021, the beginning of the energy crisis,, when 4.5 million households were in fuel poverty. Adam Scorer, chief executive of the fuel poverty charity, said:  This is, of course, good news – any fall in energy bills is welcome. However, the drop coming in April still leaves bills significantly higher than they were before the energy crisis began. For two and a half years, household budgets have been stretched beyond breaking point by high energy bills. Households in fuel poverty, on negative budgets and in impossible debt will see no chink of light this morning. The cost gap between where they are right now and escaping fuel poverty is getting wider. Whatever relief might be felt by this news, years of punishingly high energy bills will continue to take a heavy toll. Stubbornly high prices are here for the foreseeable future – the government cannot simply ignore this as the new normal. We need a social tariff to provide permanent, deep protection for low-income households, we need action on debt to bring households out of this spiral, and we need long-term, significant investment in energy efficiency to make sure households are resilient against energy crises.

        "content": "Standard Chartered has handed its chief executive his largest pay package in nearly a decade as the lender reported a jump in profits, despite bracing for up to £1bn in potential losses due to China’s property downturn. The profit bump helped push Bill Winters’ pay up 22% to £7.8m – from £6.4m in 2022. It is the most he has been paid since 2015. The London-headquartered bank, which makes most of its profits in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, said annual pre-tax profits rose by 19% in 2023, to $5.1bn (£4bn). The update saw shares jump 9% by midday on Friday, though Winters said he was “not happy at all about where our shares are trading”. “The stock price is crap,” he said during a press briefing, adding that it did not reflect the bank’s financial position, including its “extraordinary capital discipline” and cost-cutting efforts. The growth in profits was due in part to higher interest rates, which allowed it to charge more for loans and mortgages. It said revenue from those interest charges, compared with what it paid out to savers, was expected to grow in 2024 “and beyond”. The stronger performance helped offset the money that the bank put aside for potential losses. The lender is ultimately expecting a maximum $1.2bn hit linked to its Chinese commercial real estate portfolio, offset by improvements in other parts of the business. Standard Chartered also took a $153m hit in the value of its stake in China Bohai Bank, as Chinese lenders have become increasingly exposed to bad debts from its property crisis. “There’s some concern that the the property loan sector will impact Bohai and other Chinese banks over the coming quarters and years,” Winters said. “We have an optimistic outlook for China, economically, although I think it’s going to be a while before they emerge from this very challenging transition.” The chief executive said the property crisis had shaved at least 2% from China’s annual GDP growth, but that the crisis was now “finding its bottom”. However, he said Standard Chartered would not look at fresh investments in the country’s real estate market. “I don’t think that that market is going to turn around any time soon”. While Winters saw his pay jump, Standard Chartered’s bonus pool for its bankers fell 1% to $1.6m, although shareholders were handed a final dividend worth 21 cents a share. The lender also announced a $1bn share buyback, putting further cash in investors’ pockets. This week, its rival HSBC nearly doubled the payout for its own chief executive, Noel Quinn, to £10.6m. It came after the bank reported a 78% jump in pre-tax profits, despite taking a $3bn charge linked to its stake in China’s Bank of Communications, which it bought in 2004, as well as a $200m provision for its commercial real estate exposure. Investors had previously been assured by Quinn’s comments last autumn that the property market crisis was nearing its end. But the year-end figures spooked shareholders, resulting in an 8.4% fall in HSBC’s share price on Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop in four years. Asked why he thought Standard Chartered was undervalued, Winters said: “The market finds us complex. They think that it’s probably hard for us to get things done. And they think that we sometimes spread ourselves too thin, over too many products, too many client segments, too many markets. And our response to that is to say first of all, we are going to change the way we work.” Winters said that under his “fit for growth” overhaul plan, the bank has been reviewing its global footprint. That has involved investing in promising markets such as Saudi Arabia, while closing a number of operations including seven of its African retail businesses, as well as divisions serving the Philippines, Qatar, Oman and Thailand. “We’re completely focused on addressing the shareholder concerns because we are completely optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver on this plan.”"

        "content": "US regulators have accused a man of making $1.8m (£1.4m) by trading on confidential information he overheard while his wife was on a remote call, in a case that could fuel arguments against working from home. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it charged Tyler Loudon with insider trading after he “took advantage of his remote working conditions” and profited from private information related to the oil firm BP’s plans to buy an Ohio-based travel centre and truck-stop business last year. The SEC claims that Loudon, who is based in Houston, Texas, listened in on several remote calls held by his wife, a BP merger and acquisitions manager who had been working on the planned deal in a home office 20ft (6 metres) away. The regulator said Loudon went on a buying spree, purchasing more than 46,000 shares in the takeover target, TravelCenters of America, without his wife’s knowledge, weeks before the deal was announced on 16 February 2023. TravelCenters’s stock soared by nearly 71% after the deal was announced. Loudon then sold off all of his shares, making a $1.8m profit. Loudon eventually confessed to his wife, and claimed that he had bought the shares because he wanted to make enough money so that she did not have to work long hours anymore. She reported his dealings to her bosses at BP, which later fired her despite having no evidence that she knowingly leaked information to her husband. She eventually moved out of the couple’s home and filed for divorce.  Today we charged a Houston resident with insider trading for using non-public information he obtained from his wife, a manager with BP, without her knowledge, about the company’s planned merger with TravelCenters of America. https://t.co/lJ9SjHBDcX— U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) February 22, 2024  Eric Werner, the regional director of the SEC’s Fort Worth office in Texas, said: “We allege that Mr Loudon took advantage of his remote working conditions and his wife’s trust to profit from information he knew was confidential. The SEC remains committed to prosecuting such malfeasance.” The case is expected to fuel arguments – particularly at US companies – for workers to return to the office, reversing the boom in home working prompted by the pandemic lockdowns. Banks such as Goldman Sachs have been forcing some staff to come in five days a week, while others such as Google are factoring office attendance into their regular staff performance reviews. Concerns about security and confidential information could end up trumping studies that show working from home can deliver big health benefits, allowing people to eat more healthily, feel less stressed and have lower blood pressure. Loudon did not deny the allegations outlined in the SEC complaint, which was filed at the US district court for southern Texas, and instead agreed to a partial judgment, subject to court approval. That partial judgment will ban him from taking company leadership roles, force him to repay the money he made from the trade – with interest – on top of an extra fine to be determined by the court. He is facing criminal charges from the US attorney’s office for the southern district of Texas. The SEC filing said Loudon, who is in his early 40s, is employed with an unnamed publicly listed company but is not in a sector supervised by the regulator."

It’s a different story for the wider business community, where an estimated third of companies have suffered fatalities. And yet Horizon, which manages $1.6bn (£1.26bn) in assets, has remained open throughout. “We haven’t shut the offices one day since the invasion.” The company’s 35 staff relocated to Lviv, near the border with Poland, for a few weeks at the start of the invasion, but Koszarny and her team soon returned to Kyiv and have remained in the capital since then.

Amid the bombardment, talk of capital raising can feel out of place, but Ukraine’s ability to keep its economy afloat and continue exporting is crucial to the war effort. “Everyone across the board feels it’s a patriotic duty to operate and pay taxes; 60% of budget comes from private sector taxes. That is what is paying the wages of military in Ukraine,” said Koszarny. Horizon Capital traces its history to the post-Soviet era. In the 1990s, after the fall of communism, the US set up a string of investment funds in eastern Europe, including one for Ukraine and Moldova. Horizon, which still invests in both countries, was spun out into a private entity in 2006. Horizon usually takes a minority stake, typically the only outside investor alongside company founders. Its focus is on export-oriented sectors: IT, food and agriculture, and light manufacturing; businesses that generate hard currency – the euros and dollars needed to fund Ukraine’s defence.  Its portfolio includes Rozetka, an Amazon-style e-commerce platform; Ajax, which makes wireless home-security systems and sells across Europe; and the discount retailer Avrora. A mid-market pound shop concentrated in south and east Ukraine, Avrora took a hit after the invasion, falling from 863 stores to 636 as areas where it operated were seized by Russia. But it has surged back, growing to about 1,300 stores, with one opening every 17 hours. On its shelves, 80% of the stock is made in Ukraine. Managers also used their expertise to set up a humanitarian logistics network, moving cargo from 48 locations to send aid to local communities. Horizon’s Moldova ventures have included the Purcari winery, which listed on the Bucharest stock exchange in 2018. Koszarny grew up in Canada’s 1.4 million-strong Ukrainian community, where she was taught the language, traditional dancing, and learned to play the bandura, a lute-type instrument. “It was instilled in me that Ukraine was not free, Ukraine was not independent, that hopefully, in my lifetime, I would see that. When it happened, I was 22 years old; it was a dream come true.” She moved to Ukraine in 1993, two years after independence, working for the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, now PricewaterhouseCoopers, before co-founding Horizon in 2006. The company is rare in the world of private equity as a firm founded and run by a woman, and Koszarny described its approach to investing as “gender-smart”. In 2015, after the annexation of Crimea, she helped organise the first Ukraine House at Davos, a fringe event to the World Economic Forum that has taken centre stage since 2022. She is one of four women who, unpaid and in their free time, run the event each year. “We had seen red lines crossed in 2014 with the invasion of Ukraine, international order crumble, and limited reaction. We decided it was important for Ukraine’s voice to be amplified,” said Koszarny. They started in one room in a former Timberland store in 2015, and now have 3,767 sq ft (350 sq metres) in a house on the town’s promenade. This year at Davos, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, called on western governments to seize Russian assets and use them to fund the reconstruction. About $300bn-worth belonging to the Russian central bank have been frozen in the west, largely in foreign currency, gold and government bonds. About £26bn of that is in the UK, and David Cameron, the British foreign secretary, has been vocal about making it available to Ukraine. He too made the case at Davos, saying: “At the end of the day, Russia is going to have to pay reparations for its illegal invasion, so why not spend some of the money now, rather than wait till the war is over.” The City of London is resisting, concerned it could discourage other states from banking in the UK. Legislation may be needed to force financial institutions into handing over the cash. A recent report put the cost of reconstruction at $500bn. “Folks need to find a legal mechanism for Ukraine to be able to rebuild and that bill is starting to mount,” said Koszarny. “Should the aggressor nation or western taxpayers pay for that?” For Koszarny, and many like her, Ukraine’s future is as part of the EU. The country has applied to join the bloc, and been accepted into the accession negotiations process. There has been some resistance, particularly from member states that fear Ukraine’s vast agricultural sector will damage their own farmers. Despite the war, the country still exports enough food to feed 400 million people. It also has the second-largest gas reserves in Europe and the lithium needed to build electric car batteries. “It’s in the EU’s interests,” she said. “Ukraine should not be a buffer country; it is a strong actor in its own right that has defended the gates of Europe. For the EU and its members, it is in their national security and economic growth interests that Ukraine be part of the fold.”"

        "content": "It wasn’t an imagined nightmare: Rolls-Royce really was flat on its back in 2020 during the early stage of the Covid pandemic. Cash was flowing out of the engine-maker at an annual rate of £4bn as the commercial airline industry, like the rest of us, went into lockdown. Management was modelling a “severe but plausible downside scenario” in which things could get even worse. The finance director skipped off to Ocado, which, at the time, had a stock market value three times that of Rolls. An emergency rights issue to raise £2bn at the miserable price of 32p a share was eventually launched that autumn, with the government playing a supporting role as guarantor of £3bn of the company’s debt. To say the skies have cleared would be to grossly understate matters. Thursday’s full-year numbers for 2023 showed record cashflow of £1.3bn and a surge in underlying profit of almost £1bn to £1.6bn. Almost unbelievably, the share price, up another 8% to 357p even after the 220% gain in 2023, is now heading towards an all-time high when adjusted for the dilutive effect of the rights issue. Rolls is worth £30bn and is a top-20 FTSE 100 company again. (Ocado’s shares, incidentally, have nose-dived since 2021: terrible timing by one Stephen Daintith). An open question is whether the 2027 targets set by Tufan Erginbilgic, Rolls’s chief executive for the past year, will now be reached early. The ambition – operating profits of up to £2.8bn, profits margins of up to 15%, annual cash inflows of up to £3.1bn and a return on capital of up to 18% – felt optimistic when set last November, but nobody is saying that now. If the civil aerospace division, the largest, can produce an 11.6% margin in 2023 when flying hours (critical for service revenues) were still below pre-pandemic levels, it doesn’t require a great leap to think a fatter figure is possible if, as predicted, former levels of activity will be surpassed this year. Meanwhile, the defence division is nicely supported by the Aukus submarine defence agreement between Australia, the UK and the US. Erginbilgic is clearly ahead of schedule. A question from the other direction, though, is whether he was guilty of hyperbole when, on arrival, he described Rolls as “a burning platform”. The answer to that one is probably also yes: he was overdoing it. The trajectory of the airline industry was already upwards. Improvement has allowed some easy wins: a £100m debt owed by one airline (Rolls didn’t name it) that was previously viewed as unrecoverable can now be pursued. That’s handy. None of which is to deny the force of Erginbilgic’s impact. He has raised expectations, credibly, of what the company is capable of achieving. It is a meaningful difference to hear a Rolls boss talk aggressively about renegotiating contracts to recognise the real commercial value of the technology. But the new man would do himself a favour by acknowledging that his inheritance wasn’t quite as rotten as supposed, which was the gist of a sharp letter to the Times last month from Sir John Rose, Rolls’s chief executive between 1996 and 2011. Erginbilgic has “the luxury of not chasing market share today”, said Rose, which is surely true: it is easier to throw your commercial weight around when you start with a 30% share in wide-body aircraft engines and have excellent kit. Harvesting the gains was always part of the longstanding script. Erginbilgic is doing a terrific job, but it would do him no harm to say the flames were subsiding when he arrived. Since he got his £7.5m-worth of “golden hello” shares at 91p, and they’re now worth £29m, it would almost be polite."

A trip to east London, which we often make to see our grandchildren, leaves you with no illusions. Bikes flashing past you in all directions, jumping red lights, and riders not wearing crash helmets. Frequently knocked off their bikes and poorly clad in the cold and the rain, delivery cyclists pay a price for the convenience they provide. The profit goes to their employers. It is our own equivalent of sweatshops and chimney boys, and is a disgrace.John BeerFarnham, Surrey • Nesrine Malik is right that delivery app riders are under immense and increasing pressure to deliver, and this shows in the explosion of rider numbers in cities and the increase in their speeding on fast e-bikes through pedestrian areas. Their exploitation is “baked in” to the delivery system to make high profits for the app companies. However, there is a direct link between exploitation and rising consumer demand, so a simple solution for consumers is not to lazily use a delivery app, but to get off our arses and physically get the takeaways ourselves.Fred RileyNottingham"

Mark Crossley, the Indivior chief executive, said: “We are excited to announce that we are initiating consultations with shareholders on potentially transitioning to a primary listing in the US in 2024 while maintaining a secondary listing in the UK.” It is the latest in a number of delistings and high-profile flotation snubs to the London Stock Exchange, despite the UK government’s efforts to attract and retain companies in the country.   Related: Global share rally triggered by AI boom; UK and eurozone business activity picks up – business live   Last week, the Anglo-German travel company Tui said it would ditch its share listing in London, after shareholders voted overwhelmingly for a sole listing in Frankfurt. The chief financial officer, Mathias Kiep, said there had been a shift in liquidity from London to Frankfurt. The Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, which is owned by Japan’s SoftBank, opted to list on New York’s Nasdaq last year along with other tech companies, in a snub to Rishi Sunak’s government, which had tried to persuade the company to list in London. Indivior makes most of its revenue in the US, but the switch in its listing could prove a setback for its British business, which has historically been the home of its pharmaceutical research. Indivior reported 21% net revenue growth for 2023, driven by its Sublocade and Perseris drugs, and expanded its pipeline of potential treatments for substance use disorders. The company said on Thursday it made an adjusted operating profit of $269m (£213m) last year, up 27% from 2022. Sublocade is an injected prescription medicine used in adults to treat addiction to opioid drugs alongside counselling, while Perseris is used to treat schizophrenia in adults. Last year, Indivior, and its former parent company, the consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser, from which it was spun off in 2014, faced a lawsuit in London’s high court over allegedly false marketing of Suboxone, but the case was thrown out in December. Wirral council in north-west England had hoped to bring a representative claim on behalf of hundreds of investors that alleged Indivior wanted to switch the market for Suboxone from tablets, just before they lost patent protection in the US, to a film that is put under the tongue and dissolves. Reckitt and Indivior deny the allegations. Wirral council argued that when Indivior was indicted in the US in 2019, in one of several corporate prosecutions related to that country’s opioid crisis, the news wiped out more than £550m of its market value. But in a high court ruling, the judge Michael Green said that Wirral could not act as a representative and the claims should be struck out. The US justice department in 2019 charged Indivior with fraudulently claiming Suboxone film was better and safer than similar drugs.  Reckitt agreed to pay a $1.4bn fine to settle the case in July 2019, without any admission of wrongdoing, while Indivior said in 2020 that it had “pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement relating to healthcare matters in 2012” and that it would “make payments to federal and state authorities totalling $600m over a period of seven years”. Shaun Thaxter, the former Indivior chief executive, was sentenced to six months in federal prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to his role in a scheme to secure Medicaid coverage for Suboxone film by misleading officials about its dangers to children.  Thaxter was replaced by Crossley, the former chief financial and operations officer, who has worked at the company since 2017."

        "content": "Japan’s main stock index, European shares and Wall Street’s blue-chip listings hit all-time highs on Thursday as strong results from the chipmaker Nvidia stoked investor exuberance over a worldwide artificial intelligence investment boom. The S&P 500 enjoyed its best day in more than a year in New York, rising 2.1% amid a global equities rally. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained 3%. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, which climbed 1.2%, scaled fresh all-time highs. The Nasdaq finished just shy of its own record. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index also reached a record close of 495.10.  Earlier in the day, the Nikkei increased 2.19% to close at 39,098.68 in Tokyo. On the final trading day of 1989, it had closed at 38,915.87. The 34 years it has taken to regain its footing is a decade longer than it took Wall Street to recoup losses from the 1929 crash and Great Depression. Shares in Nvidia leapt 16.4% as trading started a day after the company reported bullish results. Booming demand for its AI chips – a key piece of infrastructure for companies building and operating AI tools – helped Nvidia post quarterly revenue and future sales guidance much above Wall Street’s already high expectations on Wednesday, lifting tech stocks globally. The gains meant Nvidia broke the record for the biggest single-day increase in a company’s stock market value, as it added $277bn to be worth more than $1.9tn – just nine months after reaching $1tn.   Related: Nvidia reports enormous revenue as AI hits a tipping point   Although the strong Nvidia results and accompanying optimism about tech stocks helped drive the Nikkei to a record high, the Tokyo index has been bolstered over the past few years by other factors, including hope that Japan is finally overcoming its historical problems with flat or falling prices, and investor concerns about the Chinese economy. A fall in the value of the yen has also helped to tempt foreign investors to the Nikkei. One analyst described Nvidia’s results on Wednesday as “the biggest moment for the market and tech sector in many years”. “This was a ‘game-changing moment’ for the tech bulls and puts jet fuel in the tech bull market thesis,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial firm Wedbush Securities. Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive, said on Wednesday the AI market had hit “the tipping point”. He added: “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.” Gains in Nvidia lifted its AI competitor Advanced Micro Devices by 10.7%, while Super Micro Computer climbed 33% and the UK-based Arm Holdings rose 4%.  Soaring demand for Nvidia’s chips used by companies rushing to upgrade their AI offerings helped the Silicon Valley company forecast first-quarter revenue growth of 233%, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 208%. The midpoint of the forecast was $24bn, which was above market expectations of about $22.2bn. Fourth quarter revenues were $22.1bn against an expected $20.6bn – up 265% from a year ago. Josh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro, said: “Nvidia continues to deliver in every way, and its results show there is still plenty of growth ahead. This isn’t just a flash in the pan, nor a bubble, but a business that continues to make serious cash.” Expectations heading into the results were very high, with shares in Nvidia surging nearly 36% this year to become the best-performing S&P 500 stock and notching a record high just last week. The share rise that fuelled the S&P 500’s climb to record highs this year had prompted fears that growth at Nvidia, seen as the bellwether for AI demand, could disappoint and potentially disrupt the market rally."

Take care! – JK  Updated at 3.56pm GMT    3.11pm GMT  US jobless claims fall unexpectedly  The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting that job growth remained solid in February. Jobless claims in the United States fell to 201,000 in the week to 17 February after rising by 212,000 in the previous week, and defied expectations of a rise to 218,000.  The strength in the US labour market supported the Federal Reserve’s view that it’s too early to talk about rate cuts, said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index.     3.01pm GMT  US private sector growth eases slightly  US companies reported further expansion in activity in February but at a slightly slower pace, with service sector growth easing a tad.  Manufacturing saw an increase in production amid an improvement in supply chains after bad weather in January, according to the flash reading of the S&P Global PMI survey. Cost pressures eased, with input prices rising at the weakest rate since October 2020, due to lower raw material costs and competitive pricing at suppliers at both manufacturers and service firms.  However, selling prices picked up, driven by the service sector.  Flash US PMI Composite Output Index at 51.4 (January: 52.0). 2-month low.  Flash US Services Business Activity Index at 51.3 (January: 52.5). 3-month low.  Flash US Manufacturing Output Index at 52.3 (January: 49.3). 10-month high.  Flash US Manufacturing PMI at 51.5 (January: 50.7). 17-month high.      2.55pm GMT   Over here, the FTSE 100 index has notched up modest gains of 0.3% to 7,687. European shares hit an all-time higher earlier. The Dax in Frankfurt has rallied 1.7% while France’s CAC has gained 1.3% and Italy’s FTSE MIB is 1.4% ahead. Europe’s broad Stoxx 600 is 0.9% higher at 495.56, after touching a record high of 495.81 in early trading.     2.34pm GMT  Nasdaq jumps 2% at the open  The opening bell has rung on Wall Street: the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped just over 2% at the open to 15,920, an increase of more than 320 points. The Dow Jones rose nearly 250 points, or 0.6%, to 38,858 while the S&P 500 gained 65 points, or 1.3%, to 5,047. Shares in the chipmaker Nvidia leapt more than 12% to a record high in early trading, following stellar results last night that spread optimism about the AI boom, and sparked a rally in stock markets around the world. Japan’s Nikkei closed at a new all-time high. Other chipmakers and tech stocks also rose: shares in the US-listed Cambridge chipmaker Arm rose 10.5% while San Francisco-based Super Micro Computer jumped nearly 18%.   Updated at 2.39pm GMT    2.31pm GMT   The eurozone’s annual inflation rate edged lower to 2.8% in January from 2.9% in December, according to figures from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, published today. The main drivers behind inflation were services and food.     2.16pm GMT  ECB more optimistic about inflation outlook but 'patience still needed'  European Central Bank policymakers agreed at their meeting last month that inflation was coming under control but indicated that any talk of interest rate cuts was premature given rapid wage growth, according to minutes of the meeting on 24-25 January in Frankfurt. In the press conference after the decision was announced to leave borrowing costs unchanged at that time, ECB president Christine Lagarde pushed back against expectations of early rate cuts, pointing to underlying price pressures.  All in all, members signalled that continuity, caution and patience were still needed, since the disinflationary process remained fragile and letting up too early could undo some of the progress made.  While the initial inflation shock had largely reversed, the task that lay ahead was the reversal of second-round effects, which might prove to be more stubborn. At the same time, members expressed increased confidence that inflation would be brought back towards the 2% inflation target in a timely manner.  But policymakers appeared more optimistic about the outlook for inflation for years:  For the first time in many meetings, the risks to reaching the inflation target were seen as broadly balanced or at least becoming more even. At the same time, the view was also expressed that, after several years of significantly overshooting the inflation target, the costs of another overshooting were likely higher than the costs of undershooting.  The ECB governing council next meets on 7 March.     1.45pm GMT   Here is our full story on Indivior.

He will take up the role in March, replacing Stephen Murphy, who is stepping down after nine years with the company.  King also chairs the pan-European lottery group Allwyn’s UK business, which recently took over from Camelot as the operator of the National Lottery, the first time the lottery has changed hands since its launch almost 30 years ago. King has also held senior roles at Marks & Spencer and Asda.     10.56am GMT   JPMorgan economist Allan Monks said:  The PMI continues to defy expectations, with the flash for February showing yet another gain in the composite output reading from 52.9 to 53.3. The PMI has over-estimated growth for a while now. Even setting aside the realistic possibility of upward revisions to 2023 GDP, however, the survey has done a somewhat better job of tracking momentum swings.  With the PMI now 4.7 points from its September low and at its highest level since last April, signs that a first-half recovery is taking hold continue to build.      10.35am GMT   Some reaction to the UK PMI data from economists:  UK composite PMI out to its highest spread over Eurozone equivalent since Q2 2022.

Nasdaq futures have jumped nearly 2%, pointing to a strong open later today.  Nvidia earnings appeared to have given global markets a new lease of life, as a huge surge in earnings brought a collective sigh of relief. Overnight gains for the Nikkei 225 saw the Japanese index surge into a fresh multi-decade high, laying the groundwork for a European session that has seen the DAX push into new highs this morning. With 85% of the S&P 500 having reported earnings, we have seen an impressive 3.2% earnings growth for the fourth quarter thus far. Nvidia’s number highlighted the company’s ongoing position at the top dog in the AI world, with the forecast of another 230% rise in revenues for Q1 signalling that this train shows no signs of slowing down. This fresh source of revenues for the tech sector comes as an advantageous time, boosting equity markets throughout this period of monetary tightening. Thus, there is a hope that the so-called Magnificent seven can continue to provide a backstop for US markets until we are in a position where the Federal Reserve can drive down rates and spark a fresh bout of economic growth. Early gains for European currencies have faltered somewhat, following a mixed set of PMI surveys that saw the manufacturing sector recovery take an unwelcome step backwards. In particular, traders will be particularly focusing on the worrying 42.3 manufacturing PMI figure out of Germany, driving the composite economy-wide reading into its eight consecutive contraction. While recent months had brought a glimmer of hope, today’s survey highlights the European Central Bank’s need to step in as soon as possible.  The ‘Magnificent seven’ refers to the US tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. In a research note on Tuesday, Deutsche Bank analysts said that the Magnificent 7′s combined market cap would make it the second-largest country stock exchange in the world. Of the G20 countries excluding the US, only China and Japan (and the latter, only just) have greater profits when their listed companies are combined.  Updated at 10.22am GMT    9.55am GMT   Recession may soon be over but lingering price pressures may continue to concern the Bank of England, said Alex Kerr, assistant economist at Capital Economics. Even so, he believes the Bank will start cutting interest rates this summer.  The small rise in the composite activity PMI, from 52.9 in January to 53.3 in February, suggests that the mildest of mild recessions at the end of 2023 may soon be over. This suggests that the risks to our -0.1% q/q forecast for real GDP in Q1 lie to the upside. The improvement in the composite activity PMI was driven by a rise in the manufacturing output balance from 45.5 to 47.3, which at face value still points to manufacturing output declining by 1.0% 3m/3m. The services activity balance remained unchanged at 54.3… the big picture is that GDP growth remains subdued. Meanwhile, the shipping disruptions in the Red Sea led to a further lengthening in suppliers’ delivery times. But the manufacturing input prices balance actually decelerated from 52.5 to 52.3. This implies core goods CPI inflation will slow from 2.7% in January to around 0.0% later this year. However, the services output prices balance rose from 57.2 to 58.5, which survey respondents attributed to continued higher labour costs. This is consistent with services CPI inflation easing only gradually from 6.5% in January to just above 5.0% in six months’ time. This will add to the Bank of England’s unease about lingering domestic price pressures. At the margin this may mean the Bank won’t rush to cut interest rates. But we still think overall CPI inflation will fall below 2.0% in April and that the Bank will be in a position to start cutting rates this summer.   Updated at 9.58am GMT    9.43am GMT  UK economy puts recession behind it but price pressures remain high  The UK economy has kept up momentum and put the recent recession behind it, but inflation pressures remain high, suggesting the Bank of England will be cautious about cutting interest rates. Business activity across the UK private sector in February expanded for the fourth consecutive month and at the fastest pace since last May, supported by another strong upturn in the service economy, the latest S&P Global Market Intelligence PMI survey showed. February data highlighted a solid improvement in customer demand, as signalled by the sharpest rise in new work for nine months. Hopes of a sustained rebound in domestic economic conditions led to the highest level of optimism for the year ahead in two years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, said the survey indicates that the economy grew by 0.2% to 0.3% in the first three months of this year, after contracting in the previous two quarters. Inflationary pressures remained elevated, though, and the rate of input price inflation edged up to its strongest since August, largely due to rising salaries in the service sector. Manufacturers recorded only a modest rise in their input prices, despite higher shipping costs and worsening supply chain disruptions in the wake of the Red Sea crisis. The latest lengthening of suppliers’ lead times was the greatest recorded since July 2022.  Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 53.3 (Jan: 52.9). 9-month high.

Updated at 9.49am GMT    9.08am GMT  Eurozone downturn eases in February  The downturn in the eurozone has eased as the service sector stabilised, but price pressures have picked up again, according to a closely-watched survey. Business activity declined at the slowest rate for eight months in February, according to provisional PMI survey data from Hamburg Commercial Bank, as a stabilisation of output in services offset a further steep downturn in manufacturing. Business confidence about the year ahead improved, hitting a ten-month high and prompting firms to raise staffing levels at a pace not seen since last July. By country, a deepening contraction in Germany, where output dropped for an eighth month and at the fastest rate since last October, and sustained output fall in France (the decline was the smallest recorded since France’s downturn began last June) were countered by faster growth in the rest of the region. Average input costs across the eurozone picked up for a second month to reach the highest level since May, and above the pre-pandemic long-run average. Service sector input cost inflation rose to a nine-month high and prices fell in manufacturing at the slowest rate for 11 months. Selling price inflation also accelerated, up for a fourth month running in February to hit the highest since last May.

Mark Crossley, the chief executive, said:  We are also excited to announce that we are initiating consultations with shareholders on potentially transitioning to a primary listing in the US in 2024 while maintaining a secondary listing in the UK.  This would be a blow to the London Stock Exchange, and the UK government’s efforts to attract and retain companies here. Indivior reported 21% net revenue growth last year, driven by its Sublocade and Perseris drugs, and expanded its pipeline of potential treatments for substance use disorders. Sublocade is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat moderate to severe addiction to opioid drugs, while Perseris is used to treat schizophrenia in adults. Last year Indivior, and its former parent, the consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser, from which it was spun off in 2014, faced a lawsuit in London’s High Court. The court threw out the lawsuit over allegedly false marketing of Suboxone in December. Wirral Council in north-west England had wanted to bring a representative claim on behalf of hundreds of investors based on an alleged scheme to switch the market for Suboxone from tablets, which were about to lose patent protection in the US, to a film that is put under the tongue and dissolves. Reckitt Benckiser and Indivior have denied the allegations. Wirral Council argued that when Indivior was indicted in the US in 2019, in one of the few corporate prosecutions related to the US opioid crisis, the news wiped out more than £550m of its market value. But High Court Judge Michael Green said in a ruling that Wirral may not act as a representative and the claims should be struck out.

The rally in global shares has been triggered by optimism that the AI boom will continue, following stellar results from US chipmaker Nvidia last night. Europe’s board Stoxx 600 index rose as high as 495.77 points, surpassing the 495.46 reached in January 2022, up almost 1% on the day. The FTSE 100 index in London is just 10 points ahead at 7,670, with the aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce the second-biggest riser, up 7.2%, after annual profits more than doubled and it forecast a further jump in profits this year. The insurer Beazley is leading gains on the FTSE 100, trading 8.5% higher, after it said in an unscheduled update to the stock market that it will hand shareholders around $300m in a capital return after a strong performance in 2023. It said its undiscounted combined ratio – a measure of underwriting performance in which a level below 100 indicates a profit – had improved from low-80s to mid-70s last year as a result of better than expected claims. Analysts at Jefferies said:  Given the strong pricing environment, we expect that a portion of the improving claims experience is underlying (and therefore repeatable), and not just a result of lower catastrophe losses. The company has also announced a $300m additional capital return, alongside its ordinary dividend. We had estimated a $175m buyback to be announced at the FY23 results. As rates begin to moderate, whilst earnings continue to be supported by strong pricing from recent years, we believe this opens the door for recurring capital returns in future years from Beazley. We currently forecast a $200m buyback per annuam for 2024-25.      8.02am GMT   Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to put aside £450m for potential fines and compensation for motor finance customers, after the UK regulator opened an investigation into whether consumers had been charged inflated prices for car loans. The lender, which also owns the Bank of Scotland and Halifax brands, said there was “significant uncertainty” over the extent of any misconduct or loss to customers that could result in penalties or payouts. It also said it was unclear when the Financial Conduct Authority might complete its investigation, creating further uncertainty for the high street lender. The consumer champion Martin Lewis said last month the investigation could lead to “the new PPI” – a reference to the multibillion-pound payment protection insurance scandal. However, the charge did not weigh on the bank’s annual pre-tax profits, which rose 57% to £7.5bn compared with £4.8m a year earlier. The bank was helped by a 3% rise in net interest income – which accounts for the difference between what is paid to savers compared with what is charged to loans and mortgage customers – to £13.3bn.   Related: Lloyds sets aside £450m for car loan fines and payouts   Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the £450m provision was lower than expected.  Lloyds delivered a decent set of results and a confident medium-term outlook. Stripping out the £450m provision, set aside as a buffer for any incoming charges from the FCA review into motor financing, and profit before tax was a decent beat. That was driven almost entirely by a release of credit impairments back into the profit line with better economic assumptions and a single-name creditor paying back a hefty chunk of debt. On the FCA review, the £450m provision was less than some had feared but there will be question marks around how Lloyds has come to that figure. Lloyds has been honest in saying the outcome of the review is largely unknown. What we do know is that Lloyds is one of the more exposed banks should the FCA deem there was misconduct and customer loss.  He said there are reasons to be optimistic about UK banks:  UK domestic banks are unloved but there’s reason to be optimistic, especially with valuations sitting where they are. Performance has clearly peaked, but there are several tailwinds yet to play out that could give room for upside beyond current consensus.  Loan default levels remain low and with the return of real wage growth, plus a stabilising housing market, consumers should remain resilient. At the same time, banks are seeing easing conditions in the mortgage market and what looks to be a peak in terms of consumers shifting to higher cost savings accounts. As these tailwinds ease, the power of the structural hedge can come through – think of this like a bond portfolio that’s rolling on to higher yields over the next few years. Lloyds looks well placed to benefit from these improving trends.      7.56am GMT  Rolls-Royce sees further jump in 2024 profits  More on Rolls-Royce. The company, whose technology powers ships and submarines, as well as making engines for big commercial aircraft, forecast a further jump in 2024 profits. It said cost cutting plans to axe up to 2,500 jobs were “well under way”. Its chief executive Tufan Erginbilgiç, the former BP executive who took the helm a year ago, said:  We are unlocking our full potential as a high-performing, competitive, resilient, and growing Rolls-Royce.  The company made an underlying operating profit of £1.6bn for 2023, ahead of analysts’ forecasts of £1.4bn and its own guidance of between £1.2bn and £1.4bn, and up from £652m in 2022. For this year, it expects profit to rise by at least 6% to between £1.7bn and £2bn, again ahead of City estimates. Rolls shares rocketed last year by more than 200%, making it the top performer in the FTSE 100, helped by a profit upgrade in July and an announcement in November that profits could quadruple by 2027. Rolls plans to sell some of its power systems business, which is set to raise up to £1.5bn in gross proceeds by 2028. It is in advanced discussions to sell the lower power range engines division to Germany’s Deutz, and has decided to exit electrical in the short term. The former relates to diesel engines and engine systems using Daimler technology.  Updated at 7.59am GMT    7.37am GMT  Introduction: Japan’s Nikkei hits record high; Lloyds and Rolls-Royce profits surge  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. Japan’s main stock index has hit an all-time closing high, ahead of the previous record set in 1989, surging on optimism about the AI boom spread by bumper results from the US chipmaker Nvidia. The Nikkei rose 2.19% to end the day at 39,098.68. On the final trading day of 1989, it had closed at 38,915.87. The 34 years it has taken to regain its footing is a decade longer than it took Wall Street to recoup losses from the 1929 crash and Great Depression. Tsutomu Yamada, senior market analyst at Abu Kabucom Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters:  For us traders, this markets the arrival of a new era. It feels like the stock market is telling us that we’ve finally escaped from deflation and a new world has opened up.  This morning here in London, we’ve had buoyant figures from Lloyds Banking Group and the aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce. Lloyds’ annual pre-tax profits jumped 57% to £7.5bn, even though the UK bank put aside £450m for potential fines and compensation for motor finance customers, after the UK regulator opened a probe into whether consumers had been charged inflated prices for car loans. Profits at Rolls-Royce more than doubled last year to £1.6bn. Last night, after US markets closed, Nvidia beat expectations again and reported sales of $22b.1n for the fourth quarter of last year, up 22% from the quarter before, and an eye popping 265% higher than in the same period the year before. And for the current quarter, it said it will deliver $24bn sales. The chief executive and company founder Jensen Huang said:  Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.  Nvidia shares jumped 10% in after hours trading.   Related: Nvidia reports enormous revenue as AI hits a tipping point   Josh Gilbert, market analyst at trading platform eToro, said:  Nvidia reasserted its place in the Magnificent 7 with another blowout quarter showing that AI use cases are exploding, and the AI boom is showing no signs of slowing down. The big question for investors is, can this continue? Put simply, yes. Nvidia continues to deliver in every way, and its results show there is still plenty of growth ahead. This isn’t just a flash in the pan, nor a bubble, but a business that continues to make serious cash. Despite the risks from issues in China and ongoing competition, that can pose headwinds moving forward, Nvidia raised its guidance for the next quarter to $24bn in revenue, putting it on track to nearly $100bn in sales over the next year.  Also last night, the US Federal Reserve’s minutes of its last meeting showed that policymakers were not eager to cut interest rates at that meeting, and expressed optimism and caution on inflation. They also modified the post-meeting statement to signal that rate cuts would only occur when the federal open market committee had “greater confidence” that inflation was diminishing. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said:  Sure, the minutes were a tad outdated, but they certainly skewed much more cautiously than when [Fed president Jerome] Powell told reporters late last month that a March rate cut was still possible, at least in the market’s view.

        "content": "Gibson, the Nashville guitar maker beloved by Jimmy Page to Ray Davies, is opening its first big store outside the US just off London’s Oxford Street, where VIP visitors will be ushered into a secret bar accessed via a door hidden in a red phone box. Opening to the public on Saturday, the 4,500 sq ft (420 sq metres) of space on Eastcastle Street is within stumbling distance of the 100 Club, the music venue where bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Clash and Blur have played. It is also close to Denmark Street, once home to recording studios and music publishers and still home to London’s biggest cluster of instrument stores. Page, whose solo on Led Zeppelin’s Since I’ve Been Loving You was played on a Gibson Les Paul electric guitar, joined fellow rock legends Brian May of Queen and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath to cut the ribbon of the Gibson Garage on Thursday – the brand’s second shop globally. After 130 years of guitar making, Gibson is venturing into retail. The company opened its first store in its home town of Nashville, in 2021, in a former railway station within walking distance of the neon lights of Music City and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Here too, the designers incorporated a secret room. The Vault, whose entrance is hidden behind a bookcase, is an invitation-only space that contains a collection of some of Gibson’s rarest guitars. Cesar Gueikian, the chief executive of the guitar brand, said he wanted the London Gibson Garage to become the centre of a musical network, which might include the Jack White’s Third Man Records near Carnaby Street and HMV’s newly reopened Oxford Street store, both of which also host gigs. In Nashville, the group created a map of local music sites – a “guitar safari” – for its shoppers and hopes to do something similar in London. “In Nashville as a consequence of our opening other like-minded brands started opening around us. It creates a kind of flow and we all get more traffic,” Gueikian said. “The Garage in Nashville has become a destination and we wanted to recreate that here in London. London is synonymous with music. Genres were created here and it has a whole music ecosystem. It was a very natural second location for us.” The US store has helped local Gibson dealers and other music-based businesses, rather than bypassing them, said Gueikian, as it has drawn more guitar fans to the area because of “an allure that you never know who you are going to run into” with well-known bands would popping by when playing in the area. To entice rock VIPs in, there is the secret bar that is accessed via a replica of a traditional red phone box. The bar is equipped with a giant sofa, a piano and numerous guitars on which players can perform their own versions of classics like the solo on Sympathy for the Devil, which Keith Richards played on a Gibson Les Paul black beauty. “If Gibson players are performing in London we expect them to be here,” Gueikian said. The store has a stage in the basement for hosting gigs and talks with well-known musicians as well as a regular buskers’ spot. It will also be possible for anyone to plug into an amp to try out one of hundreds of electric guitars on sale or sit down to strum one of many acoustic instruments. Gueikian said the brand was planning to open more Garage outlets around the world, but no more than one every 12 to 18 months in large cities with a vibrant music scene. It will also be possible to get repairs carried out or to choose the wood and metalwork for a custom-made Les Paul, which can be pre-aged so it looks similar to a guitar used by a favourite musician. The most expensive item on sale will be a £20,000 replica of “Greeny”, the 1959 Les Paul standard first owned by Fleetwood Mac’s Peter Green that is now worth millions of pounds. The cheapest guitar on sale in London is a £200 Epiphone instrument, while shoppers can pick up a basic Gibson for about £1,500. For those with less cash to splash there are Gibson T-shirts and other branded paraphernalia. For the opening, there will also be 20 custom replicas of former Noel Gallagher’s 1978 Les Paul, which was given to the former Oasis guitarist by The Smiths’ Johnny Marr. Profits from the sale of those guitars will go to the Teenage Cancer Trust. The store will also stock other brands owned by Gibson including the largest display of Kramer electric guitars in the UK, in a retro 1980s-themed room, and its cheaper Epiphone range, which is made in China."

        "content": "Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to put aside £450m for potential fines and compensation to borrowers, after the UK regulator opened an investigation into whether consumers had been charged inflated prices for car loans. The figure falls far short of some analyst estimates, which suggest the investigation into loan and commission arrangements struck between 2007 and 2021 could end up costing Lloyds upwards of £2bn. The consumer champion Martin Lewis said last month the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority could lead to “the new PPI” – a reference to the multibillion-pound payment protection insurance scandal – which ultimately ended up costing banks more than £40bn. Lloyds was one of the biggest offenders, with a PPI compensation bill of more than £20bn.   Related: HSBC shares suffer biggest one-day drop in nearly four years   But Lloyds stressed there was “significant uncertainty” over the extent of any misconduct or loss to customers that could result in penalties or payouts linked to its Black Horse division, which specialises in motor finance and holds £15.3bn in loans. Lloyds, which also owns the Bank of Scotland and Halifax brands, also said it was unclear when the FCA might complete its investigation, creating further uncertainty for the high street lender. The industry is facing a total bill of up to £13bn, according to analysts at Jefferies, while RBC Capital is now forecasting total charges of £8bn, down from a previous range of £6bn-£16bn.  Lloyds has the biggest exposure to car loans out of the UK’s high street banks at up to £2.5bn, though Barclays and Santander UK may also face significant costs of up to £357m and £1.1bn respectively, according to RBC. The specialist lender Close Brothers, which last week suspended its dividend because of uncertainty over the FCA investigation, could suffer a £252m hit. Bosses at Barclays, which stopped offering new car loans in 2019, said this week that they did not feel it was necessary to put aside cash for the investigation, “reflecting that uncertainty, but also the very low levels of complaints that we’ve actually received”. On the cost of the motor finance investigation, the Lloyds chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said: “[The] actual amounts could be higher or lower than the provision that we’ve taken, and we just have to see how things develop over the course of the coming months.” Asked whether former Lloyds executives could face penalties such as clawbacks in pay if they were found to be responsible for any potential wrongdoing, Nunn said it would be a decision for the bank’s board of directors. He took over as chief executive of Lloyds in the summer of 2021. The charge has already taken its toll on the bonus pool, which fell to £384m in 2023, compared with £446m a year earlier. Lloyds did not disclose how much of the drop reflected the potential impact of the FCA investigation. Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The £450m provision was less than some had feared, but there will be question marks around how Lloyds has come to that figure.” “Lloyds has been honest in saying the outcome of the review is largely unknown. What we do know is that Lloyds is one of the more exposed banks should the FCA deem there was misconduct and customer loss,” he added. Lloyds’s latest charge did not weigh on the bank’s annual pre-tax profits of £7.5bn, up 57% on the £4.8m a year earlier. The bank was helped by a 3% rise in net interest income – which accounts for the difference between what is paid to savers compared with what is charged to loans and mortgage customers – to £13.3bn. Nunn received a £3.7m pay package, including a £1.3m bonus. That was down slightly from the £3.8m in total pay he was granted for 2022.  Lloyds also announced a dividend of 1.84 pence a share, as well as a £2bn share buyback, which analysts said should assure some investors who may be spooked by uncertainty over the motor finance investigation. Lloyds’ shares rose by 3% on Thursday. Edward Firth, the managing director of UK banks research at KBW, said: “It is highly unlikely that the £450m charge will be the end of the story. But it is orders of magnitude below market fears, and the fact that the regulator approved a £2bn buyback does suggest that they are not expecting outsized charges later this year.”"

        "content": "It may be slightly less profitable and boast a friendlier CEO who says she does “a lot more listening than talking”, but Qantas remains an airline making serious money that could do much more to win back Australians’ hearts. The $1.25bn pre-tax half yearly profit unveiled on Thursday, while down 13% on the same period last year, was still 40% higher than the last half-year trading period before the pandemic upended travel. It was enough to put a smile on the face of the new CEO, Vanessa Hudson, for what was her first financial announcement in the top job.   Related: New Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson announces half-year profit of $1.25bn before tax   Shareholders will also be buoyed. While profit margins had taken a hit in part due to lowering air fares, the airline is flush with enough cash to announce a $400m share buy-back, representing a great transfer of wealth from customers to shareholders. Hudson spoke of her focus in the first six months as chief – repairing Qantas’ relationship with the travelling public as well as its own workers. Customer satisfaction markers had improved, including spending $230m on improvements including better call centre wait times thanks to extra staff. Fares are falling and Qantas is flying about as much as it was pre-Covid. However, in terms of sweeteners for customers, much of what Qantas announced suggests an airline playing catch up.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Onboard wifi, which customers have come to expect from airlines for much of the past decade, will be retrofitted to the airline’s existing fleet of international aircraft and turned on from the end of this year. It will be free, and with enough bandwidth for every passenger. The wifi announcement itself is a reminder of another problem at Qantas – its ageing fleet. While it has taken delivery of a steady stream of new aircraft over the past year and announced new orders on Thursday, its fleet remains older than comparable airlines, with ramifications for efficiency and expansion plans. An offer this week to earn double status credits or frequent flyer points on most bookings may have appealed to some, but it’s unclear how much Qantas’ efforts will woo average economy, price-conscious customers away from cheaper airlines. In the competitive international market, there is little to capture travellers’ imagination. Customers wanting to cash in on their loyalty through the airline’s toughest years continue to struggle to secure classic rewards seats.   Related: Airlines cancelling flights at Sydney airport could lose takeoff and landing slots in crackdown   A cursory search on Qantas’ website for a one way classic rewards economy trip from Sydney to London shows no availability in June, July or August for the most direct QF1 route. However, plenty of seats remain on sale for cash-paying customers during that busy European summer period. Meanwhile, the much-hyped Project Sunrise, to fly non-stop from Sydney and Melbourne to cities including New York, London and Paris has been delayed again. Delivery of the A350-1000 ultra long range aircraft needed for the premium flights is now only expected from mid-2026, not late-2025 as first hoped, the airline announced on Thursday. From a financial perspective, the airline is in a healthy position. Broker UBS noted that Qantas’s revenue and demand outlook appeared robust. Rating agency Moody’s said it expected Qantas to remain “well-positioned, even if the currently strong outlook for travel demand deteriorates”. The results show that for all the reputational damage done, Qantas might still be profiting from its past few controversial years, which included constraining capacity and heavy cost cuts. This included a decision to outsource 1,700 ground handler jobs, which was later deemed illegal by the high court. Future penalties, including any fallout from the competition regulator’s legal action over allegations Qantas advertised and sold tickets for thousands of flights that it had already cancelled in its internal systems, may start to nullify some of the recent financial gains. The watchdog has said it is hoping for at least $250m in fines. In the meantime, Qantas has flown out of the pandemic faster than most of its rival airlines, with its share price much closer to its pre-pandemic highs than peers like Air New Zealand, which are still languishing. To this end, Hudson seems to acknowledge there are many more levers Qantas can pull to win back customers’ affection, but it’s unclear if she feels she needs to. “We know that it’s a journey. We know it will take time, but we are seeing the results,” Hudson said."

The event, hosted by a business development network, was held six weeks after the Azerbaijan state seized the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, resulting in an estimated 120,000 ethnic Armenians fleeing the region and crossing into neighbouring Armenia. The latest territorial dispute, which follows decades of conflict in the region, led Armenians to accuse Azerbaijan of “ethnic cleansing”, a claim Azerbaijan has denied. In the days after Baku’s military operations the UK government publicly condemned the Aliyev regime’s “unacceptable use of force” in Nagorno-Karabakh and warned that it had “put at risk efforts to find a lasting peaceful settlement” in the region. But a recording of the online meeting, shared with the Guardian by campaigners at Global Witness, includes one senior UK government official encouraging business leaders to take advantage of the financial opportunities in the “huge western chunk of the country that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up”. “The Azerbaijan government is supporting what it calls ‘the great return’, which is essentially providing the opportunity for the 700,000 [internally displaced people], these refugees, to basically return to Karabakh. So you have this great opportunity here actually,” the official said. It is not clear whether the official was referring to Nagorno-Karabakh specifically, part of the far larger Karabakh region. Aliyev set out plans in 2020 to rebuild the “liberated districts” of the Karabakh region in western Azerbaijan, which includes Nagorno-Karabakh. The president said it was important that all displaced Azerbaijan citizens return to Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent districts where they used to live. A second government official told business leaders: “[There’s] a great opportunity here actually. [It was] just an empty land that was ready to be built over from scratch.” Jonathan Noronha-Gant, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: “Behind closed doors, the UK government is calling Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh a ‘great opportunity’. What century are these officials living in? It’s not a great opportunity for the UK, nor for the people who were displaced.” In the recording the first official said UK companies were “well-placed” to collaborate with the Azerbaijan government to provide infrastructure advice to “a government which has financial means given that it has very large energy resources”. Azerbaijan owns one of the world’s largest gasfields, Shah Deniz in the Caspian Sea, and is a growing exporter of gas to Europe. The official also said there was a “real opportunity here, both politically to make peace [and] to create a situation where those people who have left from both sides of the line can return, but also economic opportunities within the country itself”. A UK government spokesperson said: “These comments from UK officials have been misrepresented. Discussions of reconstruction referred to the UK government’s public work to assist with possible future development in the new towns being built for those displaced by decades of conflict. “The UK is not involved in commercial activity or reconstruction efforts in the area of Nagorno-Karabakh region recovered by Azerbaijan through its September 2023 military operation. “The UK continues to work to support stability and lasting peace after the long-running conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.” The Guardian revealed last year that Azerbaijan’s share of two large oil and gas projects operated by British oil company BP had earned its government almost $35bn (£28.6bn), or more than four times its military spending since 2020 when war broke out in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. This type of arrangement is commonplace in the oil and gas industry as a way to share the risk and reward of developing fossil fuel projects between foreign companies and the host state. BP also plans to build a 240MW solar farm in Azerbaijan’s “liberated lands”, according to Azerbaijan’s deputy energy minister. The Azerbaijani prime minister, Ali Asadov, met with the BP head of production, Gordon Birrell, recently to discuss the Sunrise solar project, which is planned for an area near the ghost city of Jabrayil, which was left in ruin after the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. “This is a great opportunity for BP to cosy up closer still to the Azeri ‘dictatorship’, nothing more,” Noronha-Gant said. Global Witness has warned BP that its investment has indirectly helped to fund Azerbaijan’s military aggression against ethnic Armenians in the contested region. BP has previously said that it supports “a peaceful settlement to the conflict and hope[s] that a final resolution will soon be found”. A spokesperson declined to comment on the UK officials’ video meeting, or on its plans to build the Sunrise solar project."

        "content": "Vauxhall’s owner, Stellantis, will make electric vans at its factory in Luton from 2025, helping to secure the future of 1,500 UK jobs at the plant. The Luton factory will produce medium-sized electric vans for the Vauxhall, Citroën, Peugeot and Fiat Professional brands, Stellantis announced on Thursday. The decision will be seen as positive news for the UK automotive industry, which has mostly recovered from a difficult period marred by computer chip shortages and the threat of Brexit trade restrictions. Stellantis warned last year it could close UK factories if tariffs were imposed on UK-EU exports, but Westminster and Brussels came to a belated agreement in December to delay the rules, paving the way for further investments. Some carmakers – notably Honda and Ford – have closed UK factories rather than investing to shift to electric vehicle production, but several others have recently announced plans to produce electric vehicles or parts. Nissan revealed in November that it would invest heavily to build two new electric models in Sunderland, while India’s Tata Sons, the owner of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, in July said it would build a £4bn battery factory in Somerset. BMW in September said it would spend £600m to upgrade its factory to build electric Mini cars. Stellantis has already started production of electric vans at its other leading UK site at Ellesmere Port, in Cheshire. There had been some doubt over the future of that plant, but it was saved by the decision to switch focus from passenger cars to commercial vans. The models built at Luton will be the Vauxhall Vivaro, Peugeot e-Expert, Citroën ë-Dispatch and Fiat E-Scudo – all of which are all built to near-identical designs, but with sales focused on different countries. The factory will focus on right-hand-drive vans for the UK, but will also be able to switch to left-hand drive. Stellantis already produces electric versions of the Vivaro at its factory in Hordain, in northern France, but the company said that it expected growing demand for medium-sized electric vans in the future. The Luton plant has the capacity to make 100,000 vehicles a year, although in the past decade it has built between 60,000 and 78,000 vans a year. Work at Luton, in Bedfordshire, will start this year on production of electric vans, although Stellantis will continue to build versions with internal combustion engines at the same factory. Maria Grazia Davino, Stellantis UK’s group managing director, said that the investment “demonstrates Stellantis’s confidence in the plant”, but said that the UK government should “stimulate more demand in the electric vehicle market and support manufacturers that invest in the UK for a sustainable transition”. • This article was amended on 22 February 2024. An earlier version said that Ellesmere Port was in Merseyside when it is in Cheshire."

        "content": "The new Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, has handed down a $1.25bn half-year pretax profit in her first financial results leading the airline, and rewarded shareholders with a $400m buyback after a tumultuous period that unseated her predecessor. The profit result was down 13% from last year’s record, but still well above pre-pandemic figures, and the airline remains flush with cash.   Related: Qantas claims it doesn’t sell tickets to flights but ‘bundle of rights’ in defence against ACCC case   Qantas said fares and capacity had normalised, resulting in reduced revenue from passengers. However, travel demand remains strong underpinned by leisure, as well as rebounding business travel that is approaching pre-Covid levels. The airline’s budget division, Jetstar, was one of the standouts in Qantas’s financial performance, with earnings from its Australian operations rising 35% to $175m in the six-month period. The financial results are the first delivered under Hudson, who moved into the top role earlier than planned amid mounting criticism of her predecessor Alan Joyce. Under Joyce, Qantas was heavily criticised for reducing capacity as post-pandemic travel demand spiked, leading to high ticket prices and huge profits for the airline. There was also lingering pandemic-era anger over lost luggage and cancelled flights.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The airline is also defending accusations from the competition regulator that it advertised and sold tickets for thousands of flights it had already cancelled in its internal systems. Qantas disclosed on Thursday that legal proceedings, if not resolved beforehand, are expected to be heard late this year. Hudson also addressed the hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and compensation payouts the airline could face. In addition to the competition watchdog’s bid for $250m in fines in relation to the cancelled flights, compensation hearings over the illegal outsourcing of 1,700 ground handlers during the pandemic will take place in March. Hudson insisted the potential large payouts would not distract the airline from continuing to invest in efforts to improve its customers’ experience and regaining public trust. “With regard to those two cases, they’re working their way through court. There will be an outcome and we accept the fact that these are a part of what the courts are weighing up,” she said. “I’m not concerned that’s going to affect spending.” Hudson said Qantas wanted to be “trusted to recover better than ever”. “We are investing in putting more people in the contact centres so we can service and respond to customers as quickly as possible,” she told reporters in Sydney. She also commended airline employees. “Having your back is my number one focus, to make sure that you have what you need to deliver the best for our customers,” she said. The reputation rebuild includes a decision by Qantas to begin proactively refunding customers with Covid credits. It still holds almost $500m in unclaimed credits. Last year, hundreds of millions of dollars in Covid credits that Qantas held were set to expire, before the airline, in the face of intense scrutiny from customers and politicians, abolished the expiry deadline for all credits and vowed to offer cash refunds to some customers. The half-year results show profit margins have compressed from last year, but Qantas still has enough spare cash to announce a $400m buy-back, which replaces a dividend. Buybacks are typically used to return excess capital to investors and bolster a stock price. The airline’s net profit came in at $869m, down 13% from last year’s strong figures, and its capital expenditure is rising.   Related: Can Alan Joyce’s departure save Qantas? – podcast   On Thursday the airline also announced the order of eight additional A321XLR aircraft, which will operate on Qantas’ domestic network. It took delivery of eight new and mid-life aircraft during the first half of the financial year, and a further 14 aircraft are scheduled to arrive before July, as part of a fleet renewal plan. The board is also being renewed: former Telstra chairman John Mullen will become the new chair in July after Richard Goyder announced he would depart after a wave of criticism of Qantas’s corporate performance. The Transport Workers Union, which maintains a combative relationship with Qantas and is leading the compensation case over the illegally outsourced ground handlers, said the carrier’s profit was “obscene” and act as “a reminder of the corporate greed that has turned Qantas into a husk of its former self”. “There may be a billion bucks in the bank, but at what cost?” the TWU’s national secretary, Michael Kaine, said. “The good name of the national carrier trashed, passengers price-gouged, and workers thrown on the scrap heap. It just goes to show that money is far from the only measure of a successful business.”"

        "content": "Boeing has ousted the head of the 737 Max program as the planemaker fights to repair its reputation following a terrifying cabin panel blowout. Ed Clark, who was also general manager of Boeing’s plant in Renton, Washington, is leaving the business with immediate effect, according to an internal memo. His exit was first reported by the Seattle Times. The company has scrambled to reassure regulators, airlines and passengers since a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet was forced into an emergency landing last month. The dramatic incident during an Alaska Airlines flight – which prompted 171 Max 9 jets to be grounded for several weeks – has sparked the biggest safety crisis for Boeing since the crashes of two of its Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. Clark will be replaced by Katie Ringgold, who is currently vice-president of 737 delivery operations. Boeing also created a new role of senior vice-president for quality in its commercial airplanes business, appointing Elizabeth Lund to the post. It comes after an initial report by the US safety regulator found the Alaska jet’s cabin panel appeared to have been missing four key bolts. The bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were absent, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said. In a message to Boeing employees on Wednesday, Stan Deal, who leads the company’s commercial airplanes division, said the changes were made as part of its “enhanced focus on ensuring that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements. Our customers demand, and deserve, nothing less.” Clark “departs with my, and our, deepest gratitude for his many significant contributions over nearly 18 years of dedicated service to Boeing”, Deal added, offering him the company’s “very best wishes”. The shake-up followed a meeting of Boeing’s board, according to a source familiar with the matter. Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, has acknowledged the business faces a “serious challenge” to win back the confidence of regulators and airlines. Some analysts had called into question whether senior executives at the company would have to resign. Calhoun plans to meet with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief, Mike Whitaker, next week after the top aviation regulator traveled to Renton to tour the Boeing 737 plant. The FAA initially grounded the Max 9 for several weeks in January, and has capped Boeing’s production of the Max while it audits the planemaker’s manufacturing processes.

        "content": "HSBC shares suffered their biggest one-day drop in nearly four years, after the bank recorded an 80% fall in profits linked to a writedown in the value of its stake in a Chinese bank. Pre-tax profits fell to $1bn (£793m) in the final three months of 2023, down from $5bn a year earlier. This was primarily due to a $3bn charge linked to HSBC’s 19% stake in the Bank of Communications (BoCom) in China, which it bought in 2004. BoCom is China’s fifth largest lender and, like its peers, is exposed to the ripple effects of China’s property downturn, which recently resulted in the forced liquidation of developer Evergrande. Concerns are mounting over the country’s banking sector, with a rise in bad debts linked to the crash in property prices. However, HSBC insisted that the charge on BoCom was linked to an “accounting process” that took into account “various macroeconomic data” rather than BoCom’s direct exposure to commercial real estate. HSBC separately put aside $200m to cover potential losses linked to direct exposure to mainland China’s commercial real estate sector in the fourth quarter. That was despite the chief executive, Noel Quinn, having suggested last quarter that China had already experienced the worst of the crisis. “I did say last quarter that I thought the market had bottomed. I still believe that,” Quinn told a press briefing on Wednesday morning. “I also said last quarter that it will take a few years for the market to work its way through the current challenges. So I didn’t say challenges were over. “But I did believe the activity levels in the commercial real estate market, the valuations in the commercial real estate market in mainland China, had bottomed, and that what I saw was a progressive and gradual recovery in the market.” The news sent HSBC shares down 8.4%, its biggest daily drop since the early days of the pandemic in April 2020, when lenders were forced to cancel their dividends by the UK regulator amid fears over a surge in defaults linked to Covid lockdowns. The picture across the year was brighter, with a 78% rise in annual pre-tax profits, as HSBC benefited from rising interest rates in both the west and also Asia – where it makes the bulk of its earnings – allowing it to charge its customers more for loans and mortgages. HSBC’s profits were also flattered by its emergency rescue of Silicon Valley Bank UK during the mini banking crisis in March 2023. Overall, profits rose to $30.3bn, up from $17.1bn a year earlier and marking a record high. However, that missed analyst estimates of $34bn. The bank went on to nearly double Quinn’s pay packet to £10.6m , from £5.6m in 2022, thanks to a long-term bonus in HSBC shares worth more than £5m. The bank also increased its overall bonus pool for staff by 12% to $3.8bn (£3bn).   Related: Barclays to cut costs by £2bn, raising fears of further job losses   The bank is preparing to pay shareholders another dividend worth 31 cents a share, taking its total payout for the year to 61 cents. It also is planning a share buyback that will hand up to $2bn to investors. However, profits may have peaked, given the likely future easing of interest rates and further pain from China’s real estate market. Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “The likely reduction of interest rates globally could remove a plank from a core growth area of late, while the rather messy performance in the fourth quarter could lead to some rather more negative momentum. “Indeed, in the group’s own outlook, HSBC is forecasting slow growth for the first half of the year, followed by a gradual recovery, while inevitably the parlous state of the Chinese economy in general and the real estate sector in particular are ominous headwinds.” • This article was amended on 21 February 2024. An earlier version said that HSBC’s bonus pool was $3.8m instead of $3.8bn."

        "content": "Fraud investigators have raided three homes as part of a major inquiry into a failed property company that owned several landmark buildings and owed investors millions. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) made four arrests after dawn raids on Wednesday in Merseyside and Greater Manchester in relation to its investigation into Signature Group, which collapsed in 2020 owing up to £140m. The Liverpool-based company, which was founded by Lawrence Kenwright, spent seven years buying historic buildings in UK cities to be redeveloped into hotels, office spaces and high-end flats. These included Millennium House in Liverpool, Belfast’s Scottish Mutual Building and the Coal Exchange in Cardiff. It also owned a cruise liner that was marketed as a “flotel” and moored in London with the intention of travelling to Ibiza. The SFO said that more than 1,000 domestic and overseas investors had put money into the business or bought up flats or office space, and were promised returns of between 8% and 15%. However, in April 2020 one of its biggest subsidiaries, Signature Living Hotel Ltd, entered administration owing £113m, with other subsidiaries following suit. The SFO said it had found people “up and down the country” who were left out of pocket, while buildings in city centres had been left derelict. About 50 SFO staff were present at the dawn raids, alongside 20 officers from the National Crime Agency. The Guardian understands that one of the homes was in Greater Manchester and the other two were in Merseyside. The SFO said that it would not be confirming the identities of any individuals arrested. The company had more than 20 developments, including the Shankly and Dixie Dean football-themed hotels in Liverpool and the George Best Hotel in Belfast, which never opened. Kenwright said to staff in 2020 that the unprecedented financial situation the company found itself in had been “caused by the difficulties that the hospitality sector faces as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic”. Nick Ephgrave, the director of the SFO, said: “The scheme offered attractive returns and used much-loved local landmarks to lure investors. Today’s arrests and searches will help us reconstruct exactly what happened. This is now an active criminal investigation.” This is the fourth investigation started by the SFO since Ephgrave joined the agency in September with a pledge to increase the number and speed of inquiries. In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London last week, he said the SFO would be “bolder, more pragmatic, more proactive” under his leadership."

        "published_date": "2024-02-21T17:30:55+00:00",
        "content": "Whitehall officials have recommended extending post-Brexit steel quotas – a development that will come as a relief to the British steel industry, which had feared a rise in imports. The “steel safeguards”, which were due to expire at the end of June, were first brought in by the EU in 2018, which feared that countries such as China would dump excess steel on the market after sales to the US were blocked by Donald Trump. The UK copied the safeguards when it left the EU, and extended them in 2022 in an effort to protect domestic producers from the overflow. The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, will have the final say over whether the government will continue to intervene in the steel market once industry has been given an opportunity to respond, after civil servants at the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) recommended it. Another extension would mean the UK steel industry would be protected from a flood of imports until June 2026, when they would expire under World Trade Organization rules. The UK industry or government must then apply for new measures from 2026. The UK steel industry is under pressure, amid a global recession in demand which has left steelworks across the world looking for customers to take up their spare capacity. At the same time, Britain’s two remaining primary steelworks – Tata Steel’s at Port Talbot and the Chinese-owned British Steel plant at Scunthorpe – have announced expensive plans to close their blast furnaces and switch production to cleaner electric arc furnaces. Sales of the products covered by the safeguards account for about 84% of five UK producers’ £5bn turnover, the TRA said. Under the safeguards, the UK would impose tariffs on 15 categories of steel products if imports rise above set quotas. Badenoch has previously expressed her distaste for government intervention, although as business secretary she has signed off on £500m in state aid for Tata’s shift to electric arc furnaces. Tata in January confirmed that it would push ahead with the plan, which will result in the loss of 2,800 jobs. Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel, a lobby group, said: “The TRA’s recommendation is a huge relief for the steel sector, knowing that we are one step closer to retaining this vital measure for another two years. “UK Steel is delighted that the TRA has recognised that steel safeguards are more than ever necessary to shield the UK from the inevitable trade diversion of all the surplus material that will be shut out of other key markets.” UK Steel figures suggest that global steelmakers have more than 630m tonnes of overcapacity, 60 times the size of the UK market. “Even a small proportion of this steel being diverted to the UK would completely overwhelm our market,” Stace said."

        "content": "When the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, called Birmingham’s lord mayor, George Barrow, from the top of the a new 177-metre-high tower on 8 October 1965, he was marking a significant leap forward in British telecommunications technology. The call, made during the building’s opening ceremony, was the culmination of four years of tricky construction. Meant to support a boom in long-distance communication, the tower could handle up to 150,000 telephone conversations and 40 television channels at its launch. But the 3,000-tonne structure, which cost £2.5m to build at the time – equivalent to more than £60m today – was also part of a changing London skyline, and was easily the tallest building in the city until the 1980s. Originally commissioned by the General Post Office (GPO), it was designed by staff at the Ministry of Public Building and Works, including Eric Bedford, who had become the ministry’s youngest ever chief architect at 41. It was a once-in-a-lifetime assignment, requiring soaring height to secure line of sight for radio links and transmissions. The sky-grazing tower inspired GPO staff, who were offered a £10 prize to name the new building. But despite offering up submissions including Pointer, Spindle, Liaise, and Telebeacon, the firm eventually settled on an obvious name: Post Office Tower. Within three weeks of its grand opening, more than 50,000 people had visited its observation gallery, helping the gift shop sell more than 1,500 plastic towers. Also popular were its Top of the Tower restaurant and cocktail bar, with a menu that boasted “strawberries, whether in season or not”. Managed by Billy Butlin – owner of the eponymous chain of UK holiday camps – the 34th-floor rotating restaurant gave diners 360-degree views of the city, taking about 23 minutes to complete a full cycle. But terror struck in on Halloween night in 1971, when a bomb exploded in a 33rd floor men’s toilet. The device, planted in the lowest level of the public viewing galleries, blew out thick walls and damaged cars and buildings with falling debris 350 metres (1,200ft) away. A call to police soon after the blast claimed the “Kilburn battalion” of the IRA had been behind the devastating attack, although another caller suggested it had been the work of the Angry Brigade, a group of far-left anarchists. While no one was injured, the damage took two years to repair and the attack resulted in security being ramped up at public buildings throughout the capital. It also precipitated the closure of the gallery and restaurant, the latter of which became invitation-only until it shut for good in 1980 after the owner’s lease expired. By that point, more than 4.5 million people had visited the site, which was renamed the British Telecom Tower in 1984 when the GPO’s telecommunications arm was privatised, and the BT Tower in 1992 when that company rebranded. While the landmark has featured as a key location in television and film – including Doctor Who, the 1967 Peter Cook and Dudley Moore picture Bedazzled and the 2005 film V for Vendetta – it technically remained a state secret for years. Taking or owning photos of the tower was a breach of the Official Secrets Act and the tower was omitted from Ordnance Survey maps until the mid 1990s. Its significance was formally recognised in 2001 when it was declared a national monument by English Heritage, and two years later when it was given Grade II-listed status. And in a symbol of its move into the digital age, in October 2009 an “information band” video screen was wrapped around the 36th and 37th floors. It would go on to feature messages for the London 2012 Olympic Games (when the tower was also used as a launching pad for fireworks), as well as showing Queen Elizabeth II’s first ever tweet in 2014. The tower’s future is now in the hands of New York-based hotel operator MCR, which has agreed to buy the site from BT Group for £275m. The upmarket hotel rooms in prospect are likely to be reserved for well-heeled visitors. But MCR has promised to “open the building for everyone to enjoy”, suggesting the once popular site could again draw thousands of visitors."

Dhingra, the most dovish rate-setter at the BOE, warned that delaying interest-rate cuts comes at a cost for living standards and could trigger a hard landing for the UK economy. She says today:  “Waiting for lagging indicators of domestic relative price growth to fall sharply before reducing rates comes with a cost of foregone improvements in living standards and a risk of lowering supply capacity for the future.”   Bank of England policymaker Swati Dhingra warned that delaying interest-rate cuts comes at a cost for living standards and could trigger a hard landing for the UK economy https://t.co/PG8oX28Rps— Bloomberg Markets (@markets) February 21, 2024  Economists have said the chancellor has ‘limited’ room for tax cuts in next month’s budget, after the UK recorded its biggest budget surplus for a January since records began in 1993. Falling interest costs on the UK national debt helped the UK post a surplus of £16.7bn last month, and means the government has borrowed over £9bn less than expected this financial year. Economist Dr Roger Gewolb explains:  “Jeremy Hunt has been handed a pre-budget tax boost of £9.2 billion today, which he could - and had certainly better - use for his upcoming Budget next month. Today’s data sees the UK recording its biggest budget surplus in at least 30 years. Hunt has some room for tax cuts, but perhaps not enough for a significant giveaway. The government is expected to borrow £10 billion less this financial year compared to the £123.9 billion predicted by the OBR during the Autumn Statement. I predict that Hunt will have enough extra funds to decrease income tax by at least 2p and/or move thresholds and also cancel the planned increase in fuel duty”.

She says:  Despite an easing in inflation and some real wage recovery, consumption remains below its pre-pandemic level. This is in striking contrast to the Euro area and the United States where consumption bounced back some time ago.   Dhingra also points out that the impact of the recent run of 14 rate hikes in a row would still continue to be felt for some time. Yesterday, governor Andrew Bailey estimated that around 70% of that impact has been felt.     3.16pm GMT   MPs on the Treasury committee have heard that UK economic growth will remain weak this year, while inflation is expected to fall. The committee is holding a hearing on economic forecasting – as covered earlier, they are disappointed that neither the IMF nor the OECD would attend and discuss their own forecasts for the UK. But they do have three UK experts. Nina Skero, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, tells the committee that the CEBR expects growth of 1.1% this year. That’s a pick-up compared to 2023, but still “historically low”, Skero points out. The CEBR expect inflation to approach but not return to the Bank’s 2% target, with headline inflation forecast to be 2.2% at the end of 2024. Charlie Bean, the former BoE and OBR economist, predicts UK output will “pretty much flatline” this year, and possibly pick up a bit through the year. He doesn’t believe the 0.3% drop in GDP in October-December is the start of a “deeper downturn”, as it’s partly due to a fall in retail sales in December which unwound in January. On inflation, Bean says it’s “pretty much baked in” that inflation will come near to the 2% target in the spring, as large increases in price levels a year ago drop out of the comparison. But he (like the BoE) expects inflation to pick up in the second half of 2024. Jack Meaning, chief UK economist at Barclays, predicts growth will be “pretty stagnant” in the first quarter, and doesn’t see the recession carrying on. He forecasts sub-trend growth all though this year, with the economy ticking along and stagnating rather than accelerating. But growth will pick up in 2025, he believes, ending next year above trend. And on inflation, Meaning predicts it will fall below 2% in April when the energy price cap changes, and stays below 2% through 2024 and first half of 2025.  Updated at 3.26pm GMT    2.56pm GMT   Swati Dhingra also criticises claims that wages and services prices are rising too fast for the Bank to hit its 2% inflation target (as other policymakers have argued) She says:  This is based on summary reasoning that multiplying the labour share of about 60 percent with wage growth rates above 3.5 would take us above target. This reasoning is inconsistent with recent historical evidence. The pre-GFC era in the 2000s was marked with high wage growth of 4-5 percent and yet inflation was subdued.       2.51pm GMT   The UK economy has already “flatlined over the last year”, points out Swati Dhingra. She says some other advanced economies have not faced “the difficult trade-off between lowering inflation and sacrificing recovery to the same degree as the UK”.      2.48pm GMT   Swati Dhingra argues in her speech that there is little risk of a wage-price spiral, saying:  Nominal wage growth remains stronger than in recent history, but the collective steer from several sources of data suggests wage growth is easing, including in higher frequency and forward-looking indicators. Quantity-based measures of the labour market that are available in a timely manner provide further evidence of the reduced likelihood of tight labour markets pushing up on wages and hence prices in the future.       2.28pm GMT  BoE's Dhingra warns against delaying interest rate cuts  Swati Dhingra, the most dovish member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, is warning of the risks of leaving interest rates high for too long. In a speech titled Money’s Too Tight (To Mention) [a nod to the pop hit from The Valentine Brothers, covered by Simply Red in 1985], Dhingra is explaining that the outlook for headline inflation is “bumpy but downwards”. She argues that delaying the first rate cut until there is more evidence that inflation is easing risks hurting households, and the economy. Dhingra tells an event organised by Market News International Connect:  Waiting for lagging indicators of domestic relative price growth to fall sharply before reducing rates comes with a cost of foregone improvements in living standards and a risk of lowering supply capacity for the future.  Dhingra was the only MPC member to vote to cut interest rates, from 5.25% to 5%, last month – two members wanted to raise rates, and the other six voted to leave them unchanged. The other members of the MPC want to see more signs that inflation is moving sustainably to the Bank’s 2% target.

It would be a mistake, she says, to favour keeping policy too tight:  Going forwards, the restrictive stance of monetary policy is expected to continue weighing on economic growth and living standards for more time, even if moderation starts now. In my view, the evidence to err on the side of overtightening is not compelling as it often comes with hard landings and scarring of supply capacity.   The financial markets expect the Bank to cut rates to 4.5% by the end of this year, with the first cut pencilled in by June. Yesterday, BoE governor Andrew Bailey said he was comfortable with an interest rate profile that has cuts in it, but wouldn’t say by how much rates would be cut, or when.

Total application volume plunged 10.6% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. The drop came as the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose back over 7%.

Chair of the Treasury Committee, Harriett Baldwin, says both the IMF and the OECD were invited to take part, and she’s “disappointed” neither has accepted the invitation. The committee had hoped that both groups would discuss the assumptions which underpin their forecasts on the UK economy, ahead of next month’s budget. Baldwin says it is “incredible” that the IMF won’t show up today, despite issuing forecasts about the UK, but reports that the OECD were more forthcoming. She says:  “I’m disappointed neither has accepted our invitation to come to Westminster ahead of the Spring budget and discuss the assumptions which underpin their forecasts on the UK economy.  “I am heartened, however, by the positive intent and engagement shown by the OECD during our discussions. We will continue to work with them to find a suitable time for a public session when schedules allow, to ensure proper democratic scrutiny of their work can be carried out.  “On the contrary the IMF’s outright refusal to let us scrutinise their forecasts of the UK economy in public is infuriating. Yet they continue to utter public pronouncements about the UK from their perch in Washington. As the IMF is a public body partly funded by the UK as a shareholder, I find this incredible.”   Last November, the OECD predicted that UK growth would remain “stable but low”, with national output rising by 0.5% in 2023 and by 0.7% in 2024. The IMF has ruffled feathers in Westminster; first it predicted the UK would go into recession last year, then changed its mind last May. Then in January it issued a strong warning to Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes in the budget.

Heathrow made an adjusted pre-tax profit of £38m in 2023, up from a loss of £684m in 2022, and the first profit since 2019. It handled 79.2m passengers last year, making 2023 the third-busiest in Heathrow’s history. It hope to break the record this year, and is aiming to welcome a record 81.4m passengers.  Updated at 12.10pm GMT    11.39am GMT  German economy in difficult waters as government slashes forecast  Barely a day goes by, it seems, without downbeat economic news from Germany. And today’s is that Berlin’s government has slashed its growth forecast for this year. The German government expects the economy to grow 0.2% this year, far less than a previously forecast 1.3%, as weak global demand, geopolitical uncertainty and persistently high inflation dent hopes for a swift rebound. The revised forecast was approved by the cabinet on Wednesday as part of the government’s annual economic report, government sources told Reuters. A draft of the report seen by Reuters says:  “The German economy continues to find itself in difficult waters at the beginning of the year.”  Germany’s economy shrank by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2023, and would enter a technical recession if it shrinks in the current quarter too.     11.37am GMT  Share your memories of the BT Tower  We want to hear people’s memories of the BT Tower following the news that it will be converted into a hotel.

BAE Systems made underlying profits before interest and tax of £2.7bn on record sales of £25.3bn in 2023. Charles Woodburn, the BAE chief executive, said the weapons manufacturer was expecting “sustained growth in the coming years”. He told reporters on Wednesday:  “Instability in Europe, the Middle East and other parts of the world brings into sharp focus the vital role that we play in protecting national security.”     Related: Arms maker BAE Systems makes record profit amid Ukraine and Israel-Gaza wars       11.04am GMT  UK factories report highest selling price inflation since July  Just in: Output at UK manufacturers has fallen over the last quarter, while prices are heading upwards. The CBI’s latest Industrial Trends Survey, just released, shows that a net balance of 19% of firms reported a drop in output in the last quarter – worse than the 10% recorded in the thee months to January. However, manufacturers expect output to rise marginally in the quarter to May.  The latest CBI Industrial Trends Survey found that manufacturing output volumes fell in the three months to February at a faster pace than in the quarter to January. Output is expected to rise marginally in the three months to May. #ITS pic.twitter.com/3drEd21zAX— CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) February 21, 2024  And there’s worrying news for the Bank of England: Expectations for average selling price inflation accelerated in February. A balance of 17% of companies are rasing prices this month, up from 9% in January.  Tha’s the highest reading for selling price expectations since July 2023, but still much lower than the multi-decade high of +80% in March 2022.  Expectations for selling price inflation accelerated in February, climbing above their long-run average.

But there were also some hopeful signs. Order books improved - in the case of export orders to above their long-run average - and manufacturers continue to expect output to improve in the months ahead.      10.51am GMT  FTSE 100 in red  The UK stock market is having a weak morning, with blue-chip shares in the red. The FTSE 100 index has lost 66 points, or 0.85%, to 7652 points. HSBC are dragging the index down; its shares have lost 8% this morning, after reporting a fall in profits in the last quarter. Mining giant Glencore are down 3.2%, after it posted a 75% drop in net income for last year, from $17.3bn to $4.28bn. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says:  HSBC represents the biggest drag on the FTSE 100, as shares in this banking giant tumbled in spite of their record full-year profits for 2023. Investors took a dim view of the $3 billion impairment charge associated with the bank’s Chinese investment, dampening sentiment around the Asia-focused bank. With continued concerns around the Chinese real estate sector, and global interest rates expected to fall, investors are taking a somewhat cautious approach after both earnings and revenues fell short of expectations. Glencore shares have slumped into a two-year low this morning, following on from an earnings report that has seen this mining giant report a collapse in their adjusted core earnings, which halved from $34 billion to $17.1 billion. This served as a stark reminder of the impact felt by falling commodity prices, with continued difficulties in the Chinese economy highlighting ongoing concerns that we may see further struggles this year.      10.39am GMT   Aldi has announced plans to create 5,500 new roles across the UK this year.

The portrait of the monarch will appear on existing designs of all four banknotes (£5, £10, £20 and £50), with no other changes to the existing designs. The new banknotes will only be printed to replace those that are worn, and to meet any overall increase in demand for banknotes, the Bank says. And there’s certainly no need to throw existing notes away! Polymer banknotes that feature the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II will remain legal tender, and will co-circulate alongside the King notes. But businesses that use machines that accept, sort or check banknotes will need to adapt them so they accept these new designs (there are details of what to do here). The Bank says:  Machines requiring updates include those receiving notes, such as transport ticketing machines, self-service checkouts, gaming machines, vending machines, back-office machines and any other machines that are used to check banknotes are genuine.

Henderson says the £16.7bn January surplus is ‘slightly disappointing’,   Although the healthy January figure will no doubt be an accolade that the Conservative party will publicly celebrate, in regard to the readthrough to the fiscal headroom available for the upcoming 6 March Budget, today’s data was slightly disappointing. The OBR had expected an even larger surplus of £18.2bn at the time of the Autumn Statement, meaning the numbers eat into some of the extra headroom gained in the interim relative to the OBR forecasts, when all else is equal (a rather big caveat!). However, thanks to more favourable numbers in the past, on the financial-year-to-January, borrowing is still tracking lower than the OBR had expected (£96.6bn vs OBR’s £105.8bn).  Henderson also points to rumours that Hunt could make a 1p cut to the basic rate of income tax (which could cost £7.2bn by 2026-27.), adding:  With the Chancellor likely reaching deep into that sofa to find the pennies, a cheaper further 1p cut to employee’s National Insurance Contributions may be favoured, costing £4.7bn.      9.25am GMT   MCR Hotels are the third-largest hotel owner-operator in the US, MCR says it will work with Camden-based Heatherwick Studio to consider how best to turn BT Tower into a hotel. Tyler Morse, CEO and owner of MCR, says:   “We are proud to become owners and custodians of the iconic BT Tower.  We will take our time to carefully develop proposals that respect the London landmark’s rich history and open the building for everyone to enjoy.”  Turning a 177 metre-high tower into a hotel sounds like a big challenge. But MCR does have experience of such projects; it developed the TWA Hotel at New York’s John F. Kennedy airport, which turned JFK’s original terminal building into a hotel with over 500 rooms.     9.18am GMT   The sale of the BT Tower to hotel chain MCR comes almost 60 years after it was opened for operations by prime minister Harold Wilson, in 1965. The Tower was London’s tallest building for 16 years, until it was overtaken by the NatWest Tower, which opened in the City of London in 1981. The BT Tower was open to the public until 1971, when a bomb exploded on the 33rd floor of the Tower. Shortly after the blast the tower and the restaurant were closed to the public.     9.02am GMT   Looking back at the public finances…new data from HM Revenue and Customs show that tax receipts have jumped by £33.6bn this financial year, to £695.1bn. That includes a £21.1bn rise in takings from income tax, capital gains tax and national insurance contributions, to £390.9bn. Nigel Holmes, director for Research and Development at tax services and software provider Ryan, says business tax bills also rose:  “It’s a strong start to the year for HMRC. January’s receipts for business-related taxes totalled £9.3bn, bringing the total from April 2023 – January 2024 to £77.4bn, representing a £8.8bn increase on the same period the year before. One driver behind the increase in takings will be the Chancellor’s decision to increase Corporation Tax to 25% in April 2023. “All eyes will be on the upcoming Spring Statement to see if the Chancellor will announce new changes to help boost British businesses.  Last year, full capital expensing was made permanent, enabling companies to deduct the entire cost of their investments on IT and machinery from their taxable profits in the year of spend. Let’s hope that the needs of UK businesses will be at the front and centre of next month’s budget too.      8.40am GMT  BT Tower to become hotel  Just in: BT is selling its telecommunications Tower in the centre of London to MCR Hotels, for £275m. MCR Hotels plan to turn BT Tower into a hotel, which means it will remain as a London landmark for the future, the telecoms group says. Brent Mathews, property director at BT Group says:  “The BT Tower sits at the heart of London and we’ve been immensely proud to be the owners of this important landmark since 1984. It’s played a vital role in carrying the nation’s calls, messages and TV signals, but increasingly we’re delivering content and communication via other means. This deal with MCR will enable BT Tower to take on a new purpose, preserving this iconic building for decades to come.”  The Tower, located in Fitzrovia, was built in 1964 by the General Post Office (GPO), and used to spread telecommunications traffic from London to the rest of the country. But its role in communications has diminished as fixed and mobile technology changes, and its microwave aerials were removed more than a decade ago as they were no longer needed to connect London to the rest of the country. As well as containing communications equipment and office space, it also contains a viewing galleries and a rotating restaurant on the 34th floor. The restaurant has gone, but that floor does still spin, and gives some brilliant views over central London. It’s used for hosting corporate and charity events these days (public access ended in 1971 after a bomb blast).  Updated at 9.20am GMT    8.28am GMT  EY ITEM Club: Major tax cuts look less likely  Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has analysed today’s public finances, and concluded that Jeremy Hunt will have “limited” headroom to cut taxes while sticking to his fiscal rules. Beck says:  “January’s outturn, combined with downward revisions to earlier months, means borrowing in 2023-2024 should come in below the OBR’s forecast of £123.9bn. But with the Spring Budget approaching, the Chancellor’s focus will be on how much headroom the OBR projects against his medium-term fiscal targets. On that issue, the market curve for interest rates over the next few years is lower than that adopted by the OBR in November, which should cut forecast spending on debt interest. And the OBR’s new forecast will incorporate the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) new and bigger population projections which, all else equal, should raise projections for GDP, employment and tax receipts. “But against these positives, investors have recently reined back predictions of how much rates will be cut this year, narrowing the gap with the OBR’s assumption. The starting point for the OBR’s new economy forecast is weaker, given the level of cash GDP in Q4 2023 was almost 1% smaller than projected in November. And lower-than-expected inflation will weigh on revenue from the freeze in tax thresholds. On balance, the EY ITEM Club thinks the Chancellor will have room to manoeuvre, but major tax cuts are looking less likely.”      8.01am GMT   Shares in HSBC have dropped by 4.5% at the start of trading, after missing profit expectations this morning.     8.00am GMT  HSBC nearly doubles CEO’s pay despite fall in fourth-quarter profits  In the banking sector, HSBC has nearly doubled the pay packet for its chief executive, Noel Quinn, despite reporting a drop in fourth quarter profits this morning. HSBC’s earnings took an unexpected hit from its exposure to China’s real estate downturn. The London-headquartered lender disclosed on Wednesday that it had settled on a £10.6m package for Quinn, marking a significant rise from the £5.6m he received for 2022, thanks to a long-term bonus in HSBC shares worth more than $5m. The bank also increased its overall bonus pool for staff by 12% to $3.8m. It came amid a surprise drop in fourth-quarter profits, which fell to $1bn from $5bn a year earlier, primarily due to a $3bn charge linked to the lender’s stake in the Bank of Communications in China, where lenders are struggling with a downturn in the country’s real estate market. Quinn has told reporters this morning that he still believes China’s real estate market has bottomed out: More here.   Related: HSBC nearly doubles CEO’s pay despite fall in fourth-quarter profits    Updated at 8.40am GMT    7.46am GMT  Despite January’s surplus, the Chancellor will \"probably have limited headroom\" for tax cuts  Jeremy Hunt will probably only have “limited headroom” in next month’s budget, despite the record surplus racked up in January, predicts Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Gregory estimates Hunt will only have £15bn to play with, which won’t be enough for a “big pre-election splash”, despite January’s record surplus reported this morning. She tells clients this morning:  We think that probable downgrades to the OBR’s GDP and inflation projections will mean the Chancellor has just £15bn (0.5% of GDP) to play with whilst still meeting his fiscal rules. We suspect he will unveil a smaller net giveaway than November’s £21bn of about £10bn (0.4% of GDP) and that he will have to resort to a further squeeze on public spending to meet his fiscal rules. But resolving the problem of how to deliver such tight spending plans will be a problem left for after the election.  There were reports last week that Hunt was considering billions of pounds of new spending cuts to fund pre-election tax cuts.   Related: Jeremy Hunt ‘considering spending cuts’ to fund pre-election tax giveaway   That would be on top of the “implausible austerity” already pencilled in for after the election under Hunt’s plans. Polling last weekend, though, suggested such deep cuts could be counter-productive for the Conservatives, given public concerns over under-funded public services.   Related: Sunak is warned spending squeeze could lead to Conservative party wipeout at election    Updated at 7.55am GMT    7.39am GMT  KPMG: Chancellor bags a record budget surplus in January as he eyes more fiscal easing  Jeremy Hunt could have £21bn of headroom for tax cuts (or, say, spending rises) in March’s budget, estimates Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK. Around a third of that flexibility could be used to freeze fuel duty again, Stelmach explains:  “The latest set of data suggests that borrowing could end 2023-24 at £114 billion. We expect the OBR to upgrade its fiscal outlook on the back of a weaker expected path for interest rates, lower spending on inflation-linked debt, as well as a possible upward revision to their net migration assumptions, which are net positive for the public finances. This could increase the headroom to meet the fiscal mandate to £21 billion, up from £13 billion at the Autumn Statement. “The policy choice lies between fiscal pragmatism and a stated desire to cut taxes. Accounting for the customary fuel duty freeze could leave the Chancellor with around £14 billion to play with. This would be enough to afford a 2p cut to the basic rate of Income Tax, also benefitting the pensioners who could not take advantage of the recent reduction in the National Insurance contributions. However, it would inevitably come at a cost of a greater constrain on future policy options. Navigating this delicate balance will be a tricky task in an election year.”      7.35am GMT   Here’s ONS deputy director for public sector Jessica Barnaby on this morning’s public finances:  “January’s surplus is the largest in nominal terms since monthly records began in 1993, although borrowing in the year to January is only slightly lower than the same period last year. Tax receipts are always higher in January than other months owing to self-assessed taxes, which often leads to a surplus. Also, with recent reductions in the RPI rate, interest payable on government gilts and without last year’s energy support schemes, overall expenditure was down on this time last year, despite increased spending on public services and benefits. “As a proportion of gross domestic product, public sector debt is up on the year, and remains at levels last seen in the 1960s.”      7.34am GMT   The broader picture is that the UK’s national debt, as a share of the economy, is still the highest since the early 1960s. The public sector net debt was clocked at £2.646bn at the end of January 2024, or around 96.5% of UK GDP – 1.8 percentage points higher than a year ago. As this chart shows, the national debt jumped after the financial crisis of 2008, and again after the Covid-19 pandemic.     7.28am GMT   So far this financial year (since April), the UK has borrowed £3.1bn less than in the same ten months last year. The ONS says it has revised down its previous estimate of borrowing this year by £5.8bn.     7.24am GMT  Interest bill on national debt falls  In January, the interest payable on central government debt was £4.4bn, £3.5bn less than in January 2023. This was the lowest January interest payable since 2021 and £2.7bn less than the £7.1bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the ONS says. This chart shows how the interest bill on the national debt soared in the last couple of years, as inflation surged into double-digit levels – driving up the debt repayment cost on index-linked gilts. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, says:  “Since November, RPI has fallen from 5.3% to 4.9% on a 12-month basis. Index-linked gilts, which account for around a quarter of government debt issuance, have interest payments linked to RPI, as opposed to CPI. This has seen interest payable on index-linked gilts decline significantly since January 2023, but it is a small increase on last month’s interest bill.   Updated at 7.56am GMT    7.20am GMT  Introduction: UK posts record budget surplus in January  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. The UK has posted its largest budget surplus for a January in at least 30 years, giving a final healthcheck on the public finances ahead of next month’s budget. There was a surplus of £16.7bn last month, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows – which is the largest surplus since monthly records began in 1993, and twice as large a surplus as a year ago.  👀Biggest monthly surplus for UK Exchequer since records began (in 1993) https://t.co/2CjRCTVwvn— Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) February 21, 2024  January is typically a good month for the public finances, as it includes the deadline for self-assessment taxpayers to pay what they owe. The ONS explains:  Each January tax receipts are always higher than in other months, owing to receipts from self-assessed taxes; combined self-assessed income and capital gains tax receipts were £33.0 billion, £1.8 billion less than a year earlier.  City economists had expected an even larger surplus, though, of £18.7bn.  Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was £16.7 billion in surplus in January 2024.This was more than double the surplus of January 2023 and the largest since monthly records began in 1993.➡️ https://t.co/Hz0LLO7Kbi pic.twitter.com/iHQOT14JoY— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 21, 2024  Central government tax receipts rose by £3.9bn year-on-year, to £111.4bn in January, lifted by a rise in takings from corporation tax, income tax and Value Added Tax (VAT). Self-assessed (SA) tax receipts were a little lower than last January – although some of this money may show up in February’s public finances. On the other side of the national balance sheet, net social benefits rose by £3.4bn in January to £23.7bn. The ONS explains:  In recent months we have seen large increases in benefit payments largely because of inflation-linked benefits uprating and cost-of-living payments.  Ending the energy support schemes which provided subsidies to consumers and businesses also cut the government’s spending bill. Encouragingly, the interest payment on the national debt also fell, due to the drop in inflation over last year (used to set the repayment on index-linked bonds). Today’s data also shows that the UK has run up a deficit of £96.6bn so far this financial year. That’s £9.2bn less than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which may give chancellor Jeremy Hunt some wriggle room for tax cuts in the Budget. But, the Resolution Foundation is warning this morning that any tax giveaways next month will be squeezed in between £20bn of tax increases already implemented and a further £17bn of hikes pencilled in for after polling day. Calling this a “tax sandwich”, Resolution lay out what lies ahead for taxpayers:  Tax rises of around £20 billion were introduced in 2023-24, including freezing personal tax thresholds and increasing Corporation Tax. Highly unusually, the government has also pre-announced major tax rises for after the next election, with a further £17 billion of tax rises set to come into effect in the next parliament, including a Spring 2025 Stamp Duty rise and three extra years of tax threshold freezes. History, and significant spending cuts pencilled in for after the election, tell us that further tax rises may well be announced after polling day – as we saw in 1993, 1998, 2011, 2016 and 2020.

The US central bank will release the minutes of its last monetary policy meeting, where it left interest rates at a 23-year high; they’ll be strutinised for hints as to when cuts may come. And after Wall Street closes, chip giant Nvidia will release its latest financial results. Given Nvidia’s share pruce has more than tripled in the last year, lifted by AI enthusiasm, the stakes are high. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says Nvidia’s numbers will be the “most expected earnings of the quarter today”, adding:  Nvidia is expected to announce a sales revenue of around $20bn in the Q4 and earnings per share of $4.60. The numbers are huge if you think that sales were worth around $6 billion, and EPS was just 88 cents a year ago. We are talking about a more than 200% sales growth – which, no matter if the company meets expectations or not – is HUGE. But of course, the price action was big too. Nvidia is up by more than 400% since the beginning of 2023. This is why any correction could be massive.   In US today NVIDIA going to declare their Q4 results, all top analysts expecting its revenue should go up 200%, it means $20.5B, whole street’s eyes on its results, first time ever they’re taking so much interest in the company except Google, Microsoft & Tesla, interesting !— Riskiest_Poison.1 (@Vodka_Cyanide) February 21, 2024  The agenda  7am GMT: UK public finances for January 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey of UK manufacturing 2pm GMT: Bank of England policymaker Swati Dhingra gives a speech on ‘Recent BoE projections – key factors/judgements’ 2.15pm GMT: Treasury Committee to question forecasters about economic modelling ahead of Spring budget 3pm GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence report for February 7pm GMT: Federal Reserve releases minutes of its latest FOMC meeting   Updated at 7.38am GMT "

        "content": "Banknotes featuring King Charles will be issued for the first time on 5 June, prompting the Bank of England to warn businesses that they need to make sure their machines are ready to accept them. The portrait of the king will appear on existing designs of all four UK banknotes – the £5, £10, £20 and £50. His image will be on the front and also in the see-through security windows. However, the other design and security features will remain the same, with no other changes to the existing look of the notes. However, the rollout of the notes may be a little more low-key than some were anticipating, and that may be linked to the king’s longstanding interest in the environment: he gave a speech warning about the dangerous effects of plastic and chemical pollution in 1970, when he was 21. The Bank of England said: “[The notes] will only be printed to replace those that are worn and to meet any overall increase in demand for banknotes.” It added: “Our approach is in line with guidance from the royal household to minimise the environmental and financial impact of this change.” Polymer banknotes were introduced by the Bank in 2016, ending 320 years of paper money in Britain. The existing notes featuring the late queen will remain legal tender and will be in circulation alongside the new notes. That means people do not need to exchange or use up the banknotes featuring Elizabeth II. There are more than 4.6bn sterling bank notes in circulation with the queen’s face on them, worth a combined £81bn. The announcement marks the start of a series of changes that will need to be made to many machines that accept, sort or check banknotes to ensure they can handle the new note designs. The Bank of England wants all affected businesses – from shops, rail firms and car park operators to casinos and vending machine companies – to have completed any necessary updates by 5 June. “If your business uses or is responsible for any machines that accept, sort or check banknotes, you need to plan for their adaptation,” said the Bank. In preparation for the change, banknote equipment manufacturers were releasing updates for firms to install now, it added. When Elizabeth II acceded to the throne in 1952, the monarch did not feature on banknotes. That changed in 1960 when her face began to appear on £1 notes."

        "content": "The good news is real wages are finally going up – and not by so much that the Reserve Bank should be worried that it needs to once again raise interest rates. Last September there was a big 1.3% jump in wages. If you had just looked at that period in isolation, you would have thought the mythical wage breakout was about to occur and the RBA would be off to the races raising rates higher and higher. But in December overall wages grew by a much more moderate 0.95% and private-sector wages rose just 0.88%.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup     If the graph does not display click here The reason wage growth in December was even that large was due to the biggest jump in public-sector wages since 2008.   Related:Australia records 4.2% annual wage growth, outstripping inflation for the first time in three years   But even that 1.3% quarterly increase should not be all the surprising or concerning for the RBA, given over the past three years public-sector wages have lagged behind that of the private sector. After years of enduring arbitrary wage caps, public-sector workers are seeking some redress. But while there has been a jump, in a majority of states and territories, the wage growth in the public sector lags well behind – especially in South Australia and the ACT with its mostly commonwealth public servants:    If the graph does not display click here While the annual growth of all wages continues to rise – now up to 4.2% – private-sector wage growth looks like it has peaked:    If the graph does not display click here This accords with the most recent wage growth figures from the Fair Work Commission for enterprise agreements. After solid increases in the middle of last year, wage growth in agreements has stayed around 4.2% since October:    If the graph does not display click here It all suggests that concern wages are about to drive inflation and thus interest rates higher rather overblown. Wages are actually growing quite sensibly and finally (finally!) they are growing faster than inflation. It is often forgotten amid all the talk about “excess demand” and “wage-price inflation” that wages should grow faster than inflation. It’s a key to improved living standards. And yet for the past few years that has not happened. However, in 2023 inflation rose 4.05% while the wage price index rose 4.2%. That means for the first time since March 2021 people’s wages are higher in real terms now than they were a year ago.    If the graph does not display click here While that is good news, it’s such small growth that it’s likely people’s real after-tax wage did not go up.   Related:The awful truth at the heart of Australian housing policy | Grogonomics   Similarly, while wages rose faster than total inflation, they rose by less than the prices of non-discretionary items. Because low- and middle-income earners spend more of their income on those essential items, it means they are also less likely to have seen an increase in their ability to buy more with their pay. As it stands, we have a very long way to recover our lost real wages. This recent increase only puts the level of real wages back to where they were in September 2011:    If the graph does not display click here It also means that the average wage still buys about 5% less than it did in March 2020. While the RBA has continued to talk up the stock of household savings that is helping bolster spending (and thus demand), for those households who rely overwhelmingly on their wages, the past three years have been historically brutal. The good news is the recent stronger wage growth is pretty widespread. Last year the wage growth in around half of all industries was faster than inflation, but wage growth in all industries remain a long way behind the increase in prices since the start of the pandemic:    If the graph does not display click here And while the news of wages rising faster than inflation will be welcome to workers, businesses and employers will be less impressed given the many efforts they undertake to keep wages down. One tactic they use involves forcing workers to sign “non-compete” clauses that prevents workers from leaving one job and going to work for a competitor. This keeps wages down because it means people can’t leave one place and go elsewhere for better pay. New data from the ABS shows that more than one in five businesses have such non-compete clauses, and the bigger the business the more likely it has such a contract in place.    If the graph does not display click here While such contracts make sense for, say, CEOs of a grocery company, they make no sense for someone who just works in the store. And yet the ABS found that such restraints – including non-disclosure clauses – cover 68% of upper-level managers or executives, but applied to 75% of other employees. Such clauses mean big businesses don’t need to worry about a competitor raising wages to poach their best workers. It’s a good reminder that, just as recent inquiries have found, businesses don’t like to compete to keep prices down, they also don’t like competing with each other to send wages up.

        "content": "The BT Tower is to be converted into an upmarket hotel, after the British telecoms company agreed to sell the London landmark to the owner of some of New York’s best-known places to stay for £275m. BT Group said the deal with MCR Hotels would preserve the Grade II-listed building for the future, given that the evolution of fixed and mobile networks meant it no longer relies on the tower to carry microwave signals from London to the rest of the UK. The conversion of the site, in London’s Fitzrovia, will take time, as BT Group will take years to vacate the tower because of the scale and complexity of removing its technical equipment.   Related: BT Tower: a history of the London landmark – in pictures   BT said its media and broadcast division had already started moving services to a cloud-based platform, to ensure a “more straightforward move to a more modern and efficient premises”. MCR will pay for the site over “multiple years” as BT phases out its operations there. MCR, which operates about 150 hotels in the US including New York’s High Line hotel and the TWA hotel at JFK airport, said the transition period would give it time to develop its design plan and engage with local communities before putting forward a final proposal. The conversion into a hotel will be carried out by the architectural studio of Thomas Heatherwick, whose previous designs for the capital have included the new Routemaster buses for Boris Johnson when he was mayor, the Olympic cauldron for the 2012 Games and the abandoned plan for a Garden Bridge across the Thames.  BT’s 177-metre tower – which reached 189 metres tall when equipped with its aerial rigging – has been part of London’s skyline for decades, after its official opening in 1965 by the then prime minister, Harold Wilson.  Callout  Designed by the architects Eric Bedford and GR Yeats, and commissioned by the General Post Office, the tower served as a main hub for UK communication networks. It at one time featured a revolving restaurant on its top floor that was open to the public and made a total turn every 23 minutes, giving diners 360-degree views of the City. The restaurant was temporarily closed after a bomb exploded in a men’s toilet in 1971 on Halloween night, in an attack for which both the IRA and the Angry Brigade group of far-left terrorists claimed responsibility. It shut for good in 1981. BT Group has since used the top floor for corporate and charity events, with its “infoband” screen regularly displaying adverts and messages across London, including “Control the Virus” and other government advice during the Covid pandemic. It remained the tallest structure in the city until the NatWest Tower overtook it in 1980, and BT’s switch to fixed and digital networks led to the tower’s microwave aerials being removed more than a decade ago. The sale of the building is part of BT Group’s cost-cutting plans, with the company having already cut the number of offices from more than 300 to 30. That included the sale of its former headquarters, BT Centre, for £210m in 2019. The company has since moved to a new hub in Aldgate, on the edge of the City of London.  Those cost cuts have involved slashing tens of thousands of jobs. Last May, BT revealed it would cut as many as 55,000 roles across the company by 2030, citing the need for a leaner business as well as the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). The latest move will take its global headcount from 130,000 to between 75,000 and 90,000 by 2030. BT Group property director, Brent Mathews, said: “The BT Tower sits at the heart of London and we’ve been immensely proud to be the owners of this important landmark since 1984. “It has played a vital role in carrying the nation’s calls, messages and TV signals, but increasingly we’re delivering content and communication via other means. This deal with MCR will enable BT Tower to take on a new purpose, preserving this iconic building for decades to come.” The MCR chief executive, Tyler Morse, said he saw many parallels between BT Tower and its JFK TWA hotel, which was a reimagining of the Finnish-American designer Eero Saarinen’s 1962 landmark flight centre and received a national architecture award from the American Institute of Architects. “It has been a privilege to adapt the TWA Flight Center into new use for future generations, as it will be the BT Tower,” Morse said."

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has been provided with a boost after the latest set of figures for government borrowing showed the UK running its largest monthly budget surplus since modern records began more than 30 years ago. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that, despite the weakness of an economy stuck in recession, the state’s tax receipts in January were £16.7bn higher than spending. The ONS said the deadline for paying self-assessed income tax at the end of last month, coupled with lower interest payments on government debt, helped explain the size of the surplus – more than double the £7.5bn of January 2023.   Related: Jeremy Hunt’s budget giveaway ‘will act as sweet filling in tax sandwich’    Financial markets had expected the UK to be even more firmly in the black last month, forecasting an £18.7bn surplus. However, thanks to revisions to previous data, borrowing in the first 10 months of the 2023-4 financial year came in at £96.6bn. That was almost £10bn less than had been forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s tax and spending watchdog. Jessica Barnaby, the ONS deputy director of the public sector division, said: “January’s surplus is the largest in nominal terms since monthly records began in 1993, although borrowing in the year to January is only slightly lower than the same period last year.” Barnaby said the fall in inflation as measured by the retail prices index had meant lower payments to those holding government bonds and that the end of last year’s support for energy bills had also reduced state spending. The ONS said national debt as a share of the economy had continued to increase and stood at 96.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in January – up 1.8 percentage points since January last year. Last month’s borrowing figures will be the last before Hunt’s budget on 6 March and analysts said they would provide the chancellor with slightly more leeway to cut taxes. Ruth Gregory, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said: “January’s public finances figures delivered some much-needed good news for the chancellor in the lead-up to the budget. But we doubt this will pave the way for a big pre-election splash. “We think the chancellor will be handed ‘headroom’ of just £15bn (0.5% of GDP), limiting his ability to unveil big unfunded tax cuts if he wishes to adhere to the fiscal rules.” The chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, said: “While we will not speculate over whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget, the economy is beginning to turn a corner, with inflation down from over 11% to 4%.” Last month the International Monetary Fund strongly advised Hunt against including tax cuts in the budget. On Wednesday, the US-based body was criticised by the Treasury committee of MPs for refusing to appear before it to justify its forecasts for the UK. Harriett Baldwin, the committee’s chair said: “The IMF’s outright refusal to let us scrutinise their forecasts of the UK economy in public is infuriating. Yet they continue to utter public pronouncements about the UK from their perch in Washington. As the IMF is a public body partly funded by the UK as a shareholder, I find this incredible.”  Separately, the latest health check on manufacturing from the CBI found that the slump in UK factory output deepened in February. Of the 344 firms polled by the lobbying organisation, 42% said they had cut production in the three months to February, while 23% reported an increase. The gap of -19 points compared with -10 points in the three months to January. Firms were more optimistic about the next three months, with an improvement in order books expected to boost output."

        "content": "My friend and sometime colleague Gery Bramall, who has died aged 103, was a musical and legal translator who served for a number of years as a Labour councillor in London.I inherited Gery as my German translator when I joined the classical division of EMI Records (later EMI Classics) as literary editor in 1987; before that she had worked as classical co-ordinator at Decca Records and as a professional translator, into German and from German, French and Latin. In our 20-year collaboration, she furnished me with translations rather above the general muster, saved me from numerous howlers, and got me hooked on sushi. The younger daughter of Helene and Viktor Bloch, Gery was born into a prosperous assimilated Jewish family in Vienna, where her father was a banker and art collector. As a student she saw Hitler speak (“mesmerising”) and encountered Hans Keller, the musical young man about town. In March 1939, her family were fortunate to be able to emigrate to Britain under a negotiated safe conduct. During the second war, Gery volunteered in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (the women’s branch of the British army). In the postwar years, she sang as a soprano in the London Philharmonic Choir, most memorably at Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau’s 1951 UK debut (the Mass of Life under Thomas Beecham). She also took a degree at the London School of Economics, where she joined the Labour Society and was a contemporary of Bernard Levin. Thereafter, she entered public service, elected as a Westminster city councillor for Alderney ward in 1959, and then for a further four years for Churchill ward in 1964. At Decca she started out in the translation unit, working on sleeve notes and sung texts, before moving in the mid-1970s to head up the co-ordination unit, liaising between the recording side of things and editorial/packaging. A Decca colleague, John Kehoe, recalls: “Gery had a fine mind and a generous spirit, and she brooked no nonsense from recording producers … she was an integral part of a team that would have graced a decent university department.” After her official retirement in 1980, Gery continued to work on a freelance basis. In 1950 she married the Labour politician Sir Ashley Bramall. It was a nice token of marriage that, in 1976, Ashley and Gery had the distinction of appearing as husband-and-wife contenders on Mastermind. Ashley died in 1999, and Gery’s later years were spent at Mary Feilding Guild, the care home in Highgate, and then, after the guild’s precipitate closure, Nightingale House, the Jewish care home in Wandsworth.She is survived by her son, Anthony, who is principal guest conductor at the Gärtnerplatztheater, Munich."

        "content": "Increased military spending prompted by Russia’s war on Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza conflict helped the British weapons manufacturer BAE Systems to record profits last year, with further growth expected in the year ahead. The FTSE 100 company made underlying profits before interest and tax of £2.7bn on record sales of £25.3bn in 2023. Shares in weapons manufacturers have surged in the past two years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made governments reassess their plans for military spending. There have also been increased tensions across the Middle East since 7 October, when Hamas, which runs Gaza, killed 1,139 people in an assault on Israel. Israel has responded with months of bombardment of Gaza, killing nearly 30,000 Palestinians. BAE Systems’ sprawling interests include building nuclear submarines and fighter jets, tanks and ships, as well as guns and ammunition. Charles Woodburn, the BAE chief executive, said the weapons manufacturer was expecting “sustained growth in the coming years”. “Instability in Europe, the Middle East and other parts of the world brings into sharp focus the vital role that we play in protecting national security,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “While most of our order volume was driven by existing programme positions that predate the Ukraine conflict, orders to restock and upgrade heavy armour and munitions are starting to come through.” Jarek Pominkiewicz, an equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said BAE would benefit from a “growing recognition of the need to bolster defence spending”, particularly in eastern European and Baltic countries close to Russia’s borders. BAE’s share price dropped by more than 3% on Wednesday morning because margins were slightly lower than expected, but remain close to record highs, valuing the company at almost £38bn. Its shares have more than doubled in value since February 2022. BAE was formed in 1999 from the merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and British Aerospace, itself a union of defence companies including British Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley. It said it expected sales to rise by between 10% and 12% during 2024. Its long-term order book was also boosted last year by the Aukus pact between Australia, the UK and the US to build the next generation of nuclear-powered attack submarines, and the global combat air programme between Italy, Japan and the UK to develop a new fighter jet. BAE said that the war in Ukraine in particular had highlighted the importance of autonomous technology, while “reinforcing the critical need for munitions and maintaining legacy capabilities”. Woodburn also said the company was “very happy with our London listing”. Several of the biggest companies listed on London’s stock market have moved to the US because of concerns that UK companies are relatively undervalued. BAE Systems is unlikely to follow their lead because of the deep influence – including a “golden share” – that the UK government holds to prevent it falling into foreign ownership. Woodburn said: “If you go back a few years, I think we were trading at a discount to some of our US peers, but I think through the strong performance of the business over recent years, I think we’ve, in many ways, closed much of that gap.”"

        "content": "China holds the key to speeding up debt relief and ending the “silent crisis” that is holding back attempts to tackle poverty in the world’s poorest countries, a senior World Bank official has said. Ayhan Kose, the Bank’s deputy chief economist, said Beijing needed to be more active in negotiations to provide financial support for those countries already in, or close to, debt distress. Kose said China’s emergence as a significant creditor country over the past 15 years meant it needed to take responsibility for making a post-pandemic debt relief system work. “China needs to be more active,” Kose told the Guardian. “On debt relief China is the big player. China is critical.” The World Bank and its sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund, have grown increasingly concerned that the pandemic and higher interest rates have made life more difficult for low income countries, with 11 in distress and a further 28 at high risk of becoming so. Only a small number of countries have so far been given financial support through the Common Framework – the system to provide debt relief on a country-by-country basis established by the G20 group of developed and developing nations in 2020. Kose said poor countries were unable to borrow on global financial markets and were not getting debt relief. “So what are they going to do? They are going to cut education spending and cut health spending, and they are going to regress. That’s the opposite of what you want them to do. It makes things worse. It makes the crisis permanent,” he added. The World Bank official said it was a “silent crisis” because debt is not covered in TV headlines and no systemically important country had yet defaulted. Instead, debtors tended to be small countries, often with economic problems exacerbated by conflict, but accounting collectively for 16% of the global population. Kose added that 40% of low income countries would have lower per capita incomes by the end of this year than they had in 2019. “By not addressing debt relief we are delaying development. That’s a sad, sad outcome for the global community,” he said. Four countries have applied for help since the Common Framework was established, but only two – Chad and Zambia – have reached an agreement. Kose said the global community needed to make the Common Framework work better rather than consider at this stage a “grand scheme” along the lines of the heavily indebted poor country initiative launched by the Bank and the IMF in 1996. “But we need to be frank about the extent of the problem and establish what needs to be done and what the consequences will be if countries stay in debt paralysis for an extended period of time,” he added."

        "published_date": "2024-02-20T19:54:44+00:00",
        "content": "AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a pay package of nearly £17m last year, cementing his position as one of the best-paid FTSE 100 bosses as he drew criticism from corporate governance experts. Soriot, 64, who has made nearly £120m in the decade since he took the helm at the drugmaker in October 2012, was paid £16.9m last year, including salary, benefits and bonuses, up from £15.3m the year before, according to AstraZeneca’s annual report. He is in line for an even higher deal this year, depending on the company’s performance, with a maximum package of £18.6m including cash and long-term share bonuses. Andrew Speke, the spokesperson for the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said such excessive remuneration could not be justified. “Pascal Soriot has consistently been one of the highest-paid CEOs in the FTSE 100, getting paid around 1,000 times more than a minimum wage worker and over a hundred times more than many of his own employees,” he said. “While having effective leadership is clearly necessary for managing a company the size of AstraZeneca, it’s also fair to question whether Soriot’s contribution to AstraZeneca has really been that much greater than many of his colleagues whose expertise and hard work are likely to have also played a major role in the company’s successes.” When Soriot joined the firm from Switzerland’s Roche, AstraZeneca had a thin pipeline of new drugs and faced a hostile takeover approach from US rival Pfizer in 2014. But the board under Soriot fended it off and rebuilt AstraZeneca’s drugs portfolio, with a series of smart bets on cancer therapies that harness the immune system, and other medicines. Last year, AstraZeneca made better-than-expected revenues of $45.8bn (£36bn), driven by lung cancer drug Tagrisso and other oncology treatments, which made up more than a third of sales. Profit before tax jumped to $6.9bn from $2.5bn. The group made a big push into the rapidly growing weight loss market in November, when it struck a deal with Shanghai-based Eccogene to develop a pill to tackle obesity and type 2 diabetes. AstraZeneca said: “The recommendation from the board’s remuneration committee reflects the need to be competitive in the global market for talent. The proposed adjustments only apply to the discretionary bonus and the company share elements of remuneration and so are not guaranteed payments.   Related: Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca: ‘The climate crisis is a health crisis’   “These are subject to performance and the achievement of goals aligned to outstanding results for shareholders as well as delivery of several other metrics to ensure the sustainable growth of our business.” The company said the total shareholder return over the past three years had been 40%, “far exceeding the average of our peers in Europe and globally, and also the stock exchanges in London and the Nasdaq in New York”."

        "content": "A 9% rise in the share price counts as an enthusiastic reception for a new strategic plan, but don’t forget the context at Barclays. The shares are still worth a fifth less than in late-2021 when the chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, or Venkat as he’s known, took the helm. At 162p, they also stand at slightly less than half the bank’s reported book value of its assets. Scepticism towards Barclays, the market’s default setting since the financial crisis of 2008-09, runs deeper than one day’s applause for a promise to return £10bn to shareholders over three years. The source of that suspicion is well known. It’s not just the bank’s rate of turnover in chief executives, or its ability to find novel regulatory scrapes. It’s also the not-unrelated presence of a volatile investment banking division that is big by European standards but mid-ranking by Wall Street ones. In a post-crisis world where regulators rightly insist on fatter capital cushions, the perpetual question at Barclays is whether to stick or twist in investment banking. Back in the day, Bob Diamond and John Varley were gung-ho and swooped on the Wall Street remnants of Lehman Brothers. Antony Jenkins went into retreat. Jes Staley restored several pieces. Now comes Venkat’s answer, which he hopes will be elegant but may turn out to be indecisive. Investment banking won’t be allocated more capital to play with, so its proportion of the group’s overall risk-weighted assets should fall from 58% to about 50% because other divisions (according to the three-year plan) will be expanding. Thus the investment bank will simultaneously be “globally competitive” and “at scale”, he says, but will also “rebalance and reduce proportionally its relative size”. We’ll see, but the danger of falling between stools is obvious. The rest of the grand plan was commendably specific on targets, but not on how they will be achieved. There will be £2bn in “gross efficiency savings” by 2026 (but no hard news on job cuts) and the cost-to-income ratio, a crucial measure of efficiency for a bank, is due to drop from 67% to “high 50s in percentage terms”. Many other big banks – especially those with fewer high-maintenance investment bankers – are already lower, it should be said. Meanwhile, Barclays’ old refrain about being a “transatlantic bank” seems to have been dropped in favour of a hymn to how the UK is “a great place in which to do business and from which to do business”. That’ll win a few domestic brownie points and, actually, probably also makes strategic sense. The UK tends to produce reliably high returns in retail and corporate banking; and note that impairments in the UK, despite the economic noise, are now low. Last week’s £600m purchase of Tesco Bank looked a sound low-risk way to expand. The hard part is believing that Venkat can crank up group revenues from £25.4bn to £30bn by 2026. That’s a lot of growth, and the assumptions seem to depend in part on the investment bank, despite its handbrake on capital, chipping in. If it all comes together, the promised prize is a jump in overall returns on tangible equity from about 9% now to 12% in three years’ time. That, in turn, would fund Venkat’s core pledge of £10bn in dividends and share buy-backs. That alone explains the share price reaction. A promise to return a sum equivalent to 45% of your current stock market capitalisation is hard to ignore. Barclays’ investors haven’t heard anything similar in recent decades. But they have heard the one about how the investment bank can somehow produce more for less, and life has rarely worked out so pleasingly. Prediction: the division’s future will still dominate the Barclays debate in 2026."

        "content": "The Body Shop is to cut 300 jobs at its head office while almost half of its 198 stores in the UK could close with the loss of hundreds more jobs as the business battles for survival. Administrators told staff on Tuesday that seven stores would close immediately, with more set to follow, while numbers at its offices in London and Littlehampton in West Sussex were being cut by 40% to 400. It is not clear if jobs at the group’s warehouse, also in Littlehampton, will be affected. The retailer, which employs more than 2,200 people in the UK, called in administrators last week, less than two months after being taken over by the restructuring specialist Aurelius. It is understood The Body Shop’s entire team focused on activism – a key part of the ethical group’s identity – has been ousted.   Related: The Body Shop’s fair trade suppliers left with ‘more than $1m’ of ingredients   The seven stores that will shut on Tuesday are: Surrey Quays (London), Oxford Street near Bond Street (London), Canary Wharf (London), Cheapside (London), Nuneaton (Warwickshire), Ashford Town Centre (Kent) and Bristol Queens Road. The joint administrators Tony Wright, Geoff Rowley and Alastair Massey from FRP said: “After years of unprofitability and following a full evaluation of The Body Shop’s UK business, the joint administrators have concluded that the current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. As an immediate step, seven stores will close today, with additional closures to follow. It is expected that at the conclusion of the restructuring, more than half of The Body Shop’s 198 UK stores will remain open. “A reduced store footprint will coincide with a renewed focus on the brand’s products, online sales channels and wholesale strategies, bringing the brand in line with industry peers and supporting a return to financial stability.” In total, 1,600 people work in the retailer’s stores, so almost 800 jobs could go if the group closes half the estate. The administrators said the head office job cuts were part of creating “a forward-looking strategy and more nimble, financially viable model” and that swift action would “help re-energise The Body Shop’s iconic brand”. They added that relationships with key franchise and wholesale partners in Asia, the Middle East and Europe would be “a cornerstone of future success”. Staff said they would have to apply to the government-backed Redundancy Payments Service for their payoffs, with some having spent served decades at the ethical business. “It’s a shocking way to treat people,” one insider said. It is understood that most departments have been hit by at least some job cuts, including IT, marketing, sustainability and those working on the European websites, as well as the activism team. Aurelius is understood to be the main creditor, with secured debt that will ensure it gets paid by administrators before most other creditors. It is expected to take back the chain, but only after many shops have closed and jobs been cut. The Body Shop was bought by Aurelius for an initial payment of £117m in a deal agreed in November and finalised in early January. The future of the group’s Irish, mainland European and Japanese divisions also hangs in the balance after being sold to a group called Alma24, whose main director has close links to Aurelius. The German arm of The Body Shop, which has about 60 stores, was put into insolvency last week and workers in Belgium, where there are about 16 stores, have been told it is also heading for insolvency. The Body Shop’s fair trade suppliers who work with local communities of growers and producers from the Amazon to Africa say they have been left with more than $1m (£790,000) worth of beauty ingredients that may now never be ordered or paid for by the beauty chain. The Body Shop has passed through three owners since it was sold by its founder, Anita Roddick, shortly before her death in 2007. Roddick, who set up the business in Brighton in 1976, campaigned against animal testing of cosmetics and promoted natural products sourced ethically in a way that would support small producers around the world. She shocked fans of the brand by selling up to L’Oréal, the cosmetics multinational that owns Maybelline and Garnier, for £652m. The brand was then sold on to the Brazilian natural cosmetics group Natura, which already owned the Australian Aesop beauty brand, for €1bn in 2017. After Natura built up debts in buying the home-selling cosmetics group Avon, it quickly sold off Aesop and then The Body Shop."

We crossed $100 billion in eCommerce sales and drove share gains as our customer experience metrics improved, even during our highest volume days leading up to the holidays.\n\nShares in Walmart are up 4.2% in pre-market trading.\nBut the company has also flagged that sales growth will slow this year. It expects net sales to increase by 4.0% to 5.0% in the first quarter of 2024, but only by 3.0% to 4.0% in 2024 as a whole.\nAs the US’s largest retailer, Walmart can give us a valuable insight into consumer trends.\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, explains:\n\nThe number of transactions at Walmart rose by 4.3% in the previous quarter, however, the average ticket value fell by 0.3%. This suggests that consumers in the US are buying more things, but they are spending slightly less. This is not a sign of disinflation, according to Walmart, which suggests that the US consumer is getting slightly cautious and trading down to cheaper brands of goods.\nThe cautious US consumer may not be a reason to panic, however, it is why Walmart issued softer than expected guidance for the rest of this year. Walmart is forecasting consolidated net sales growth to rise by 4-5% this year, which is slower than recent quarters. Consolidated operating income is forecast to register growth of 3-4.5%, this year’s full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $7.12, which is a wide range, and the lower end of this range is well below the estimate of $7.09. Thus, while the headline earnings for the last quarter are stronger than expected, there are some cracks appearing in Walmart’s future outlook. \n\n\n\n\n 2.07pm GMT \n\nOver in Wall Street, shares in credit card issuer Discover Financial Services have jumped almost 13% in pre-market trading after U.S. consumer bank Capital One announced a takeover bid last night.\nCapital One, backed by Warren Buffett, plans to acquire Discover in an all-stock transaction valued at $35.3bn.\nThe deal would give Capital One access to Discover’s network of payments processing and settlement services, and could allow it to lower its reliance on Visa and Mastercard.\nIt would form the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, so could receive intense antitrust scrutiny.\n\n\n\n 1.26pm GMT \n\nAndrew Bailey and the Bank of England would be taking “a big risk” in cutting rates too soon, despite pressure from MPs today, says Pieter Staelens, portfolio manager at CVC Credit Partners.\n Staelens says:\n\n“It’s definitely welcome that the Bank believes inflation is easing, but significant cuts to base rates before the 2% target is reached feels like a big risk.\nThe Bank was criticised for being too slow to cut rates at the start of this cycle, and they need to be careful not to repeat this mistake in reverse. \nAlthough the immediate inflation picture is improving, there are still a number of pressures on the horizon, including half the world electing new governments, conflict in the Middle East and unemployment in the UK remains very low.”\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm GMT \n\nInvestors slightly raised their bets for a first BoE rate cut in June, Reuters reports, as Andrew Bailey and fellow policymakers spoke today.\nA quarter-point reduction was fully priced in only for August, they add.\nThe pound slipped to a one-month low against the euro this morning, suggesting traders were pricing in earlier cuts to UK interest rates (it’s recovered much of its losses since, though).\n\n\n\n 1.13pm GMT \n\nThis may be the key point from Andrew Bailey today:\n\n\nAndrew Bailey on the UK recession (he’s in front of the Treasury Select Committee today):“If you look at recessions going back to the 1970s, this is the weakest by a long way. -0.5% is a very weak recession.”— Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) February 20, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.58pm GMT \n\nToday’s session ends with Andrew Bailey hinting that he expects interest rates to be cut this year.\nHe tells MPs that around 70% of the Bank’s previous interest rate increases have fed through to the economy, meaning 30% is yet to come.\nBailey then explains to the Treasury Committee that he is “comfortable” with a market profile for UK interest rates that has cuts in it.\nBut, he insists, that is not a commitment to saying when it will happen, or how much easing there will be.\n[reminder: the money markets expect three quarter-point cuts this year].\n\nUpdated at 1.24pm GMT\n\n\n 12.39pm GMT \n\nOn that last point… deputy governor Ben Broadbent says some companies are doing ‘labour hoarding’.\nThey’re holding onto staff, even though activity has fallen, because they expect growth to pick-up so don’t want the hassle of having to rehire staff.\n\n\n\n 12.37pm GMT \n\nQ: Is the Bank worried that GDP-per-capita has fallen for the last seven quarters?

These terrible events are a real risk, he insists.\n\n\n\n 12.03pm GMT \nBailey: We are not seeking a recession\n\nQ: Does the Bank see a recession as a ‘necessary evil’ in getting inflation down in the long term?\n“We’re not seeking a recession, definitely not.” Andrew Bailey insists, adding:\n\n“We don’t target growth, we target inflation”.\n\n\n\n\n 12.02pm GMT \nBailey: tax cuts aren't necessarily inflationary\n\nLabour MP Keir Mather turns to fiscal matters…\nQ: Is the Bank anticipating tax cuts in the budget?\nAndrew Bailey says the Bank never anticipates fiscal changes – it models them after it happens.\nQ: But have you a view whether the tax cuts being reported could be inflationary?\nBailey says the Bank’s view is that the tax cuts in the autumn statement will have a positive effect on GDP, but won’t have much effect on inflation at all.\nThat’s because measures such as lowering national insurance should help the supply side of the economy; by encouraging people into the labour market.\nQ: You also don’t know when the election will be….\nI was hoping someone would tell us, Bailey jokes.\n“Before next February”, someone chips in helpfully.\nQ: .. are MPC members holding off cutting rates because of tax cuts in the budget are a ‘known unknown’?\nThat’s “very definitely not part of our thought process”, governor Bailey insists, saying the Bank doesn’t anticipate fiscal events or the election.\n\n\n\n 11.49am GMT \nBroadbent: Interest rate risks are both ways....\n\nBen Broadbent brushes aside the notion that the Bank is being too tardy to cut rates, despite the pain being felt in the economy by households and businesses.\nAsked about the risk that interest rates are overly restrictive, Broadbent points to the split at the MPC this month.\n\nClearly there’s a risk, but there’s also a risk that they’re not sufficiently.\nThere were two of us who voted for still higher interest rates.\n\nBroadbent also disputes the claim that all the evidence is for a cut now.\n\nIn my experience, and I’ve been doing this quite a while now, it is never the case that every lead indicator points in the same direction.\n\nBroadbent does agree that there’s been good progress in easing inflation. But a lot of the disinflation has been the unwinding of pandemic effects, such as on goods prices. \nServices inflation and wage inflation, though, are running over 6%, Broadbent adds, which is roughly double where the Bank thinks they should be to achieve price stability.\nBut… MPC dove Swati Dhingra points out that keeping rates high for too long runs the risk of a hard landing, and the risk of damaging the supply capacity of the economy (which is why she voted to cut rates this month).\n\n\n\n 11.39am GMT \n\nAndrew Bailey then denies that the Bank is ‘behind the curve’ on shifting towards cutting interest rates.\nHe says the Bank’s position has moved; it is now focused on how long rates must stay at their current levels, rather than mulling further rate rises.\nMPC member Megan Greene flags the risk of cutting interest rates too early, only to see inflation take off again, forcing the Bank to tighten again.\n(This is a lesson she learned growing up in the US in the 1980s, when Paul Volcker forced inflation out by keeping interest rates high, after the volatility of the 1970s).\n\nUpdated at 11.39am GMT\n\n\n 11.33am GMT \nMP: The lights are flashing red for rate cuts\n\nJohn Baron MP demands to know why the Bank aren’t cutting interest rates now, when the economic warning lights are “flashing red”.\nBaron cites “very pedestrian growth” in the labour market, CPI inflation trending downwards, an easing in the labour market, and a deceleration of retail goods prices.\nBoE governor Andrew Bailey reminds the committee that inflation is not forecast to be as low as 2% (its target) at the end of the year, so the question is how long must policy remain restrictive.\n“We’re not there yet,” (able to cut interest rates) Bailey adds.\n\n\n\n 11.27am GMT \n\nThérèse Coffey suggests the Bank is being held back by groupthink on its Monetary Policy Committee.\nQ: The internal members of the MPC seem to vote en bloc – would it be better to just have one collective vote from those members?\nCurrently, each of the nine members gets one vote each – there are five internal members, and four external experts.\nBailey insists the MPC are very independently minded, and points out that around 25% of MPC meetings in the last two years have seen a split among the executive (internal) members.\n\nUpdated at 11.27am GMT\n\n\n 11.22am GMT \n\nQ: What’s an acceptable leeway in the accuracy of your forecasts?\nAndrew Bailey explains that the Bank’s forecasts are conditional, so their accuracy depends how conditions move (ie: it’s not fair to set a pass/fail score).\nCurrently, the BoE provides fan charts which show the likelihood of various outcomes; it could potentially shift to a scenario-based set-up instead (this is something Ben Bernanke’s review could recommend).\nHe also pushes back against criticism for forecast-failings, pointing out that no economic model can predict wars or pandemics.\n\nUpdated at 11.26am GMT\n\n\n 11.11am GMT \n\nBoE deputy governor Ben Broadbent has also told MPs that interest rate cuts during 2024 are possible, but the timing depends on the inflation outlook.\nIn an annual report to the Treasury committe, Broadbent says the Bank’s forecasts don’t rule out an easing of policy in 2024, adding:\n\n“In my view that is the more likely direction in which Bank Rate is likely to move.\nBut even if that proves to be the case, the timing of any adjustment can only depend on the actual evolution of the economic data.”\n\n\n\n\n 11.09am GMT \nBroadbent: technical definition of a recession is unhelpful\n\nBank of England’s deputy governor Ben Broadbent also wades in about the UK recession.\nBroadbent says he finds the technical definition of a recession (two quarterly falls in GDP in a row) to be “unhelpful”.\nBroadbent tells MPs that in the decade before the financial crisis, the UK’s trend supply growth was 3% per year, or 0.75% per quarter.\nWe now think trend supply growth is less than 1%, with productivity having actually fallen in the last year.\nIn that environment, a 0.1% rise or fall in GDP is a tiny difference, Broadbent says.\nHe points out that in the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research decrees when the country is in recession (and tends not to rush its verdict).\nSecondly, the data can be revised – Broadbent reminds the Committee about the days when there was excitement that Britain was falling into a triple-digit recession; in the end, we didn’t even have two dips.\n\n\n\n 10.59am GMT \n\nAndrew Bailey says it’s “not unreasonable” for the markets to expect the Bank to cut interest rates this year.\nBut, the Bank does not endorse the market curve [where investors expect rates to be in future], or say when it will cut rates, or by how much, though, he adds.\n\n\n\n 10.55am GMT \n\nQ: Former chief economist Andy Haldane thinks the Bank could be too late to start cutting rates, having been slow to start raising them – what’s your reaction?\nAndrew Bailey repeats his point that the UK labour market remains strong, despite the ‘technical recession’.\nHe says the two quarters of negative growth, in Q3 and Q4 last year, only add up to a 0.5% drop in GDP.\n\nIf you look at recessions going back to the 1970s, this is the weakest by a long way.\n\nThe range for those recessions is GDP falls of between 2.5% and 22%, for the equivalent two quarters, Bailey says.\nQ: But how does the UK economy grow, if you have risks of inflation even when you’re in recession?\nThrough two ways, Bailey adds – first, you get price stability (which is the Bank’s job) and second you grow the supply side of the economy (which is not).\n\n\n“It’s one thing to have missed inflation on the way up, which happened, it’s quite another to then have crushed the economy on the way down. That double blow to credibility is one,i n my old job, I would be looking to avoid.” Andy Haldanehttps://t.co/vdNspPLUZE— Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) February 20, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.49pm GMT\n\n\n 10.49am GMT \n\nMPC member Megan Greene tells MPs that she changed her vote on interest rates – from a ‘hike’ to a ‘hold’ - this month, due to signs that inflationary persistence is easing.\nBut although the signs are encouraging, Greene wants to see this continue before she changes her vote to a ‘cut’.\nThere are still “risks”, Greene adds, citing the Bank’s Agents survey which suggests wage growth of 5.4% this year.\n\n\n\n 10.45am GMT \n\nQ: When will former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke publish his review of the Bank’s forecasting models?\nAndrew Bailey reassures the Treasury Committee that Bernanke is busy writing, and working very hard.\nWe might get the fruits of Bernanke’s labours in mid-Spring, Bailey suggests.\nThere’s a lot of interest in Bernanke’s work, which will try to explain why the BoE’s economic forecasts have been so wide of the mark in recent years.\nMPs want more detail on the timing; after all “spring’s happening now,” points out Angela Eagle MP.\nBailey is reluctant to be pinned down too tightly, but suggests it may come in April.\n\n\n\n 10.37am GMT \n\nAndrew Bailey adds that the Bank is seeing some ‘encouraging signs’ on inflationary pressures, including a slowdown in service sector price rises and in pay growth.\nWe don’t need inflation to come down to target before we cut interest rates, Bailey insist. \n\n\n\n 10.31am GMT \nBoE's Bailey: We expect recession will be very small\n\nQ: So, now inflation is down to 4%, and forecast to hit 2%, and the economy is in recession, what would it take for you to cut interest rates now? What indicators do you want to see?\nAndrew Bailey tells MPs that the Bank expects inflation to fall to its 2% this spring, but he warns that it won’t stay there – as the inflation rate is being moved by changes in energy prices which won’t be permanent.\nThe Bank, thus, expects inflation to pick up by the end of this year (as it forecast earlier this month).\nBailey says monetary policy has been restrictive in the run-up to the current recession, but also points out that supply side growth has been unusually weak in the period (a hint that the Bank won’t take all the blame for the recession).\nBailey also points out that Britain is at “full employment”, which is a “very good story”.\nAnd he tells the Treasury committee that the Bank expects it will only be “a very small recession”, adding;\n\nWe think the economy is already showing distinct signs of an upturn.\n\n[Reminder, the economy shrank by 0.3% in October-December, after a 0.1% contraction in July-September].\nHe adds that the Bank wants to see sign that inflation persistence easing. So it will look at services prices, pay rises, and “quantities in the labour market”, when assessing when interest rates could be cut.\n\nUpdated at 10.35am GMT\n\n\n 10.25am GMT \nMP: Interest rate rises tipped UK into recession\n\nTreasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin MP begins the session by reminding the Bank of England that it raised interest rates 14 times in a row to bring down inflation from “intolerably high levels”.\nShe pins the blame for Britain’s fall into recession on the Bank, saying:\n\nClearly, by the second half of last year, that had tipped the UK economy into recession.\n\n\n Related: UK tips into recession in blow to Rishi Sunak \n\n\n\n\n 10.23am GMT \n\nYou can watch this morning’s Treasury Committee hearing here:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \nMPs start to quiz Bank of England on inflation and interest rates\n\nOver in parliament, the Treasury committee will soon begin a hearing with the Bank of England.\nMPs will hear from BoE governor Andrew Bailey, deputy governor Ben Broadbent, and external committee members Swati Dhingra and Megan Greene.\nDhingra was the lone member of the monetary policy tommittee to vote to cut interest rates this month; the other three all voted to leave rates on hold.\nThe committee say:\n\nFigures released last week show the rate of inflation (CPI) remained steady at 4% in January – despite many economists forecasting an increase. This has led to heightened speculation that the Bank of England may consider cutting interest rates from the summer.\nMPs are likely to ask witnesses about the future path of inflation, whether risks of over-tightening monetary policy have increased since the November forecast, and their views on the future of wage growth.\nIn correspondence with the Committee Chair Harriett Baldwin, the Bank announced an externally led review of its forecasting model led by Ben Bernanke, former US Federal Reserve Chief and Nobel-Prize winner.\nQuestions are likely to explore the progress of this review, which is due to be published in Spring, and the Bank’s recent forecasting performance. \n Members may look at how the higher interest rates have passed through to mortgage rates and savings rates, and how households and businesses are coping with these changes. \n\n\nUpdated at 10.08am GMT\n\n\n 10.01am GMT \n\nBarclays also says it aims to become “the UK-centred leader in global finance”:\n\n\n\n 10.00am GMT \nWhere Barclays cost cuts will fall:\n\nBarclays have shown investors how it expects to cut £2bn of costs by 2026.\nThe plan includes cutting £700m from Barclays UK, and £100m from the UK corporate bank, plus £700m from the investment bank.\n\nUpdated at 10.00am GMT\n\n\n 9.47am GMT \n\nBarclays is the latest company to follow a popular playbook of increasing dividends and cutting costs to keep shareholders happy.\nIt’s an approach that benefits investors rather than employees, explains Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell:\n\nStaff might not appreciate this strategy as it means they may have to do additional work for the same pay, but running a leaner machine is the playbook for corporates when there is an uncertain economic outlook.\n“The news has gone down well with the market and has helped Barclays’ share price burst back to life after a long period in the doldrums. But will it be enough to protect C. S. Venkatakrishnan’s job? Having a plan is one thing, executing on it is another and so far, the jury is still out on whether he’s capable of turning Barclays around.\n\nMould also isn’t too impressed by tooday’s reorganisation (see 7.47am for details):\n\n“Like many of its peers, Barclays is a big juggernaut of a company where it is very hard to make changes quickly. The investment banking arm continues to stick out like a sore thumb as it isn’t a natural fit to the rest of the business.\nAppointing four people to lead that division suggests the CEO doesn’t know what to do with it. Too many cooks spoil the broth and the head chef is focused too much on sweet talking and not enough action.”\n\n\n\n\n 9.39am GMT \n\nBarclays CEO has said he wants to grow total income to around £30bn, from around £25.4bn today, by 2026. However, he hopes to get there by focusing on “more stable income streams” from its retail and corporate lending divisions.\nC. S. Venkatakrishnan told investors this morning:\n\n“We consider these to be more stable income streams and they have grown by about 35% since 2021. And the proportion from these more stable income streams will be about 70% of the bank’s total income by 2026”\n\n\n\n\n 9.33am GMT \nBarclays tries to woo investors in lengthy presentation\n\nCS Venkatakrishnan is now presenting Barclays’ first strategy update to investors in a decade. The event, which is running until around 1:30pm UK time, will see Venkat - as he’s known to colleagues - try to convince investors that his plan will be the one to revive its share price, in ways that its predecessors failed to. That plan is centred on a plan for a “simpler, better, more balanced” Barclays, he says, which is “dedicated to higher returns for investors” that is driven by “disciplined delivery” and “harnessed to our home here in the UK”, he has said. While part of that means dividing the group into five divisions - a UK consumer bank, UK Corporate Bank, Private Bank and Wealth Management, Investment Bank, and US consumer Bank – from its current three, it’s supposed to boost transparency and simplify the way it reports returns from each of them.\n\n\nBarclays shares rose around 5% after the bank slashed costs and said it would pivot toward growing retail and business lending in the U.K. https://t.co/7HIIAv3uMG https://t.co/7HIIAv3uMG— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) February 20, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.18am GMT \n\nDespite jumping around 5% this morning, Barclays shares are basically flat over the last five years.\nBack on 20 February 2019, Barclays shares were trading around 165p each – today they’re 155p, and that underperformance is why the bank is announcing a new strategic plan today.\nIn 2019, activist investor Edward Bramson was in the early stages of an ultimately unsuccessful battle to overhaul Barclays.\n\n\n~5 years after Ed Bramson's open letter to Barclays$BARC share price is back where it was back then pic.twitter.com/Hbm4KrLGW1— Librarian Capital (@LibrarianCap) February 20, 2024\n\n\nBramson was pushing Barclays to scale back its investment bank to focus on its more lucrative consumer operations, but failed to persuade enough fellow shareholders to back him.\n\n Related: Activist investor Edward Bramson ends Barclays battle by selling stake \n\n\n\n\n 9.06am GMT \n\nHotel chain InterContinental (+2.5%) are close behind Barclays on the FTSE 100’s top risers this morning, after reporting a jump in profits and announcing an $800m share buyback.\nInterContinental Hotels Group reported a 70% jumped in operating profits for 2023, to $1.066bn, with revenue per available room surging over 70% in China following the relaxation of Covid restrictions at the end of 2022.\nIHG continues to enjoy the release of post-Covid pent-up demand, particularly from Asia, reports Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, adding:\n\n“IHG is planning to return more than $1 billion to shareholders, including a newly launched share buyback programme worth $800 million as well as its dividend.\nMeanwhile the owner of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza reported global revenue per available room of 16.1% year-on-year, beating analysts’ expectations for 15.7% and 11% ahead of the 2019 pre-covid peak. \nA better than expected top and bottom-line performance as well as impressive plans to return cash to shareholders have all been fuelled by a strong performance in 2023 with impressive travel demand across all of its markets. These results are a major win for its new CEO Elie Maalouf, an IHG veteran who took to the top job in July after leading the Americas region for close to a decade.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.35pm GMT\n\n\n 8.52am GMT \nXTB: market approves of Barclays big giveaways and ambitious targets\n\nBarclays will need a “laser focus” to hit the targets outlined today, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB: \n\nBarclays strategic review was punchy, and it essentially boils down to two things: cut costs aggressively and boost profits and continue to return capital to shareholders, to the tune of £10bn by 2026. This is exactly the type of message that shareholders love at the moment, and it is why the market has reacted with glee on Tuesday morning.\nBarclays is reorganizing into 5 new operating divisions, with more focus on the retail bank and a wealth management arm. Investment banking will still be one of the five divisions, although with less allocation of capital and in future the IB arm will get 50% compared to 63% currently.\nBarclays new financial targets set a high bar: a 12% return on tangible equity. The return on equity in the investment bank was 7% last year, so this division will have the furthest to go to reach this target. The $30bn revenue target for 2026, which is 13% above analyst estimates, is a brave move from Barclays, and the bank has only given itself 3 years to do this. It’s not quite a moon shot, but it does require a laser focus on not only the bottom line, but maximizing revenue opportunities, and building a greater institution than what Barclays is today. However, that will require job cuts, although management were not willing to give a specific headcount target.\nAs expected, the CEO said that the main aim of its three-year plan is to drive higher returns and ‘predictable, attractive, shareholder distributions.’ The main theme of the Q4 earnings season was shareholder sweeteners, and Barclays is right at the top when it comes to sweet talking shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n 8.45am GMT \nUK middle classes ‘struggling despite incomes of up to £60,000 a year’\n\nAway from Barclays…Britain’s insecure jobs market and high housing costs are leading to the growth of a precarious middle class struggling to maintain a decent living standard on household incomes as high as £60,000 a year.\nA study released by abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a research body set up by the fund manager, said the uncertain nature of work meant there was a one in three chance that someone earning a middle income today would not be doing so next year.\nThe report – Caught in the Middle – said that problems of middle-class insecurity were especially acute for single parents, with those in employment more likely than not to be in an insecure job.\nDonald Hirsch, a policy adviser at the FFT and one of the report’s authors, said 20% of those in the middle fifth of the income distribution were struggling to pay for food and other essentials.\nHe said:\n\n“It is people earning between £30,000-£60,000 a year, depending on the type of household, people who you would expect to be doing OK.”\n\n\n Related: UK middle classes ‘struggling despite incomes of up to £60,000 a year’ \n\n\nUpdated at 8.46am GMT\n\n\n 8.36am GMT \nBarclays CEO's bonus falls 27%\n\nBarclays’ annual report is also out this morning, and it shows that CEO C.S.

The final bonus was set at 53.3% of the maximum available.\nSo while his fixed pay rose by 3%, to £2.86m (half in cash, half in shares), Venkatakrishnan’s overall remuneration decreased to £4.641m from £5.197m.\nThe “median employee of Barclays PLC” only saw their fixed pay rise by 1%, while their annual bonus fell 43%, the annual report shows.\n\nUpdated at 8.37am GMT\n\n\n 8.10am GMT \nBarclays shares jump 6%\n\nBarclays’ share price has risen by 6% at the start of trading in London, as traders welcome its plans to cut costs by £2bn and return £10bn to investors in 2024-2026.\nAnalysts at Jefferies say Barclays has announced “a relatively ambitious set of 2026 targets”, as it aims to lift its return on tangible equity to 12% (up from a statutory RoTE of 9.0% last year).\n\nUpdated at 8.23am GMT\n\n\n 8.07am GMT \n\nBarclays’ plan to cut £2bn of cuts could mean heavy job cuts among its staff.\nMax Georgiou, analyst at Third Bridge, says:\n\nBarclays now plans to reduce costs in the CIB by £2b by 2026, our experts believe a 20% reduction in headcount is needed and would not impact day-to-day operations.\nPrevious cost reduction programmes have not been executed effectively, in some part due to its political culture. A coherent strategy is needed for future success but is an uphill battle.\n\n\n\n\n 8.03am GMT \n\nBarclays has a habit of delivering mixed news – and today’s results are no different – says John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin:\n\nWhile the bank’s results for last year are more or less in line with expectations, they are still behind 2022. \nPlans to make cost reductions and revise its corporate structure should help drive improved profitability in the next few years, underpinning shareholder returns of £10bn.\nThe acquisition of Tesco Bank [earlier this month] also looks like a good, low-risk deal in terms of overlap, cost savings, and gaining some market share. Barclays is in a reasonable position and appears to be cautiously optimistic about the future, but execution of the plan set out today will be key to its performance.”\n\n\n\n\n 7.53am GMT \n\nBarclays is briefing journalists now about its new strategic plans, and its results for last year.\nIt says it cut headcount by around 5,000 full-time equivalent roles in 2023.\nGoing forward, there is no headcount target, they add.\n\n\n\n 7.47am GMT \n\nBarclays says the reorganising of its operations into five divisions will provide “an enhanced and more granular disclosure of the performance of each of these operating divisions”.\nIt will also mean “more accountability from an operational and management standpoint”.\nIt has appointed leaders for these new divisions:\n\nVim Maru appointed CEO of Barclays UK;\nMatt Hammerstein appointed CEO of Barclays UK Corporate Bank (he’ll also be head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility)\nSasha Wiggins appointed CEO of Barclays Private Bank & Wealth Management; and\nDenny Nealon will continue in his current role as CEO of Barclays US Consumer Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware.\n\nThat leaves the Investment Bank, which will have several co-leaders:\n\nAdeel Khan appointed sole head of Global Markets;\nCathal Deasy and Taylor Wright will continue in their current roles as Co-Heads of Banking; and\nStephen Dainton appointed President of Barclays Bank PLC and Head of Investment Bank Management.\n\n\n\n\n 7.35am GMT \n\nDespite the 6% drop in profits last year, Barclays’ bonus pool only became slightly shallower.\nBonuses for 2023 fell 3% to £1.2bn, down from £1.24bn in 2022.\nThere was little change in deferred bonuses either, with the total dipping to £543m from £549m a year ago.\n\nUpdated at 7.36am GMT\n\n\n 7.32am GMT \nBarclays to return £10bn to shareholders by 2026\n\nBarclays says it plans to return “at least £10bn of capital” to shareholders over the next three years, through today’s plan to boost returns and cut costs.\nThe Bank says it will do this through dividends and share buybacks, with “a continued preference for buybacks”.\nThe plan is to maintain its total dividend pot, but lift the payment per share by buying back (and then cancelling) shares.\n\nUpdated at 7.32am GMT\n\n\n 7.29am GMT \nIntroduction: Barclays announces £2bn cost-cutting drive as profits drop\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\nUK bank Barclays is planning a £2bn cost-cutting drive as it shakes up its operations, and reported a drop in profits for last year.\nPre-tax profits at Barclays fell to £6.6bn in 2023, the bank reports this morning, down from £7bn in 2022 – a slightly larger fall than expected.\nHigher interest rates pushed up earnings at Barclays UK, where income rose 5% to £7.6bn thanks to growth in net interest income – the gap between income from loans and payments to savers.\nBut Barclays’ investment bankers had a tougher year. Income at the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) fell by 4% to £12.6bn, driven by lower client activity in both Global Markets and Investment Banking.\nBarclays also spent £900m on “structural cost actions” in the final quarter of last year, its latest financial results show, taking the total bill for cost cutting in 2023 to £1.0bn.\nAnd there are more cuts to come, as CEO C. S.

        "content": "Britain is showing signs of recovery from its mild recession and will receive a boost when interest rates start coming down later this year, the Bank of England governor has said. Andrew Bailey rejected accusations that Threadneedle Street’s reluctance to cut borrowing costs despite falling inflation meant it was “behind the curve” and made it clear rate cuts were coming. “We don’t need inflation to come back to target before we cut interest rates,” Bailey said as he came under pressure from Conservative members of the Treasury committee to respond to news that the UK fell into recession in the second half of 2023. “The economy seems to be at full employment and that’s a very good story,” the governor said. In comparison to previous downturns, the UK was suffering from a “very small recession” and was now showing “distinct signs of recovery”, he added. The two quarters of negative growth last year only added up to a 0.5% drop in GDP. “If you look at recessions going back to the 1970s, this is the weakest by a long way,” Bailey said. The range for previous recessions was for the economy to contract by between 2.5% and 22% over two quarters, he added. The annual inflation rate currently stands at 4% but Bailey said he expected it to come back to its 2% target temporarily within the next few months before rising to 2.75% by the end of 2024. The Bank’s latest forecasts for inflation are based on the predicted path of interest rates in the financial markets, and these assume the first cut in borrowing costs in June or August this year. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it expected the first rate cut to be made in June. It had previously forecast this would take place in May. Bailey said: “I am comfortable with an interest rate profile that has cuts in it. What I am not saying is by how much they will be cut and when.” Conservative MP John Baron asked why rates were not already being cut given that the economic warning signs were “flashing red”. The governor said the question for the Bank was how long interest rates needed to remain restrictive to bring inflation sustainably back to target. “We are not there yet, he said.   Related: UK middle classes ‘struggling despite incomes of up to £60,000 a year’   The governor said there were “encouraging signs” inflation in the services sector and earnings growth – two of the key factors the MPC takes into account when setting rates – were moderating. Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank’s deputy governors, supported Bailey’s view that rate cuts were probable over the coming months. In an annual report to the Treasury committee, Broadbent said the Bank’s forecasts don’t rule out an easing of policy in 2024, adding: “In my view, that is the more likely direction in which Bank rate is likely to move. But even if that proves to be the case, the timing of any adjustment can only depend on the actual evolution of the economic data.”"

        "content": "Britain’s flying taxi pioneer, Vertical Aerospace, has been handed another £8m grant from the government, taking its total taxpayer backing to £37m as it tries to get its electric aircraft off the ground. The company said the funding to develop the propellers for its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVtol) aircraft was a “vote of confidence” in its technology, despite recent struggles. Vertical’s VX4 aircraft crashed in a test flight in the Cotswolds in August. Its share price is more than 90% down in little over a year, and its billionaire founder, Stephen Fitzpatrick, invested another $50m (£40m) last month to keep the business going. The £8m grant will meet half of Vertical’s development costs for its propellers and propulsion system, which it hopes will be lighter and quieter than existing technology. Fitzpatrick, best known as the founder of the gas and electricity supplier Ovo Energy and the former owner of the Manor Formula One team, said the project would be “another major step towards delivering the next generation of novel electric aviation technologies in Britain”. Vertical will lead a consortium from the aviation sector including engineers from British universities, as the UK looks to secure a place in a possible “future global market in urban air mobility”, where eVtols could supplant helicopters in providing a more socially acceptable form of rapid travel in and between cities. The industry minister, Nusrat Ghani, said: “This exciting sustainable propeller project is a fantastic example of our commitment to our world-leading aviation sector, supporting high-skilled, high-paid jobs across the UK while developing technologies of the future.” The grant comes via the UK Aerospace Technology Institute, which said the funding was “enabling the development of ultra-efficient and cross-cutting technologies in a competitive global market expected to be worth £24bn to the UK up to 2050”. Vertical has been one of the higher-profile firms in the fledgling sector, last year getting design approval from the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, for a five-seater flying taxi capable of flying at up to 200mph. Despite having orders from a number of international airlines, including American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, investors have largely remained sceptical, and Vertical shares are trading at less than 70 cents in New York after peaking at more than $10 after its stock exchange float in December 2021. Its German competitor Lilium on Tuesday announced a provisional order for 10 of its eVtol jets at the Singapore airshow. PhilJets said it hopes to launch a network serving the Philippines’ many islands."

        "content": "The cost of infant milk remains at “historically high” levels despite some price falls in recent months, Britain’s competition watchdog has said, as it launched a full-scale investigation into baby and toddler formula. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found in November that the average price of infant formula had risen by 25% in the past two years and families could save more than £500 over the first year of a baby’s life by switching to cheaper powders. The findings were part of an analysis of pricing in 10 food categories, which also included milk and ready meals. The watchdog said on Tuesday that it had decided to scrutinise formula makers through a market study, which will include “anti-reflux” and “comfort” formulas, follow-on formula for babies aged six to 12 months, and milks marketed for children over 12 months as “growing up” and “toddler” formula. Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, said: “Infant formula is a key part of the weekly shop for many parents across the UK, who rely on these products to ensure their baby gets all the essential nutrients they need. “While it’s a positive sign that prices of some products have fallen since our update last November, the cost of infant milk remains at historically high levels. We’re concerned that parents don’t always have the right information to make informed choices and that suppliers may not have strong incentives to offer infant formula at competitive prices.” After the CMA announced its findings before Christmas, Richard Walker, the boss of the Iceland supermarket chain, hit out at “exploitation” of new parents and joined calls for a price cap on baby formula. Last month, the French manufacturer Danone reduced wholesale prices on the majority of its Aptamil range to UK retailers by 7%. Iceland passed on this saving, meaning it cut the price of an 800g Aptamil pack from £12 to £11.20.  Danone, which also owns the Cow & Gate brand, accounts for 71% of the baby formula market in the UK. Alongside the Swiss food maker Nestlé, it controls 85% of the market. Danone had previously raised the price of an 800g pack of its Aptamil formula by 26% to about £14.50 between March 2021 and April 2023. The same size pack of Cow & Gate 1 rose by 31%, according to data compiled by the public health nutrition charity First Steps Nutrition Trust. In November, the CMA found there was only one UK retailer, Aldi, that sold own-label formula, and that competition was hampered because parents were reluctant to switch brands, either because they were recommended by friends and family or because their baby would only drink one type. The investigation will look at consumer behaviour and the information available to consumers; the role of the regulatory framework and its enforcement in influencing market outcomes; and barriers to entry and expansion of the formula market. Potential action after the report, which is due to be published in September, includes recommendations to government – for example, on the regulations governing how infant formula is marketed, or on the information provided to parents to help them choose an infant formula brand. The CMA does not have the power to introduce price caps on groceries. It has argued previously that in most categories, effective competition is sufficient to keep prices down."

        "content": "Barclays is to cut £2bn in costs, raising fears of further job losses as the lender shrinks its investment bank in a corporate shake-up intended to increase shareholder payouts by £10bn within three years. Barclays released figures on Tuesday showing that pre-tax profits for 2023 fell to £6.6bn, down 6% from £7bn a year earlier and slightly lower than analyst forecasts for £6.7bn. The figures were knocked by a £900m charge as the chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, revealed restructuring plans that would involve growing its “higher returning” consumer and corporate business while slashing costs and the size of the investment banking division, in Barclays’ first strategy update in a decade.   Related: Barclays launches £2bn cost-cutting drive after drop in profits – business live   The charge was meant to jump start an “efficiency” programme that will ultimately save the bank £2bn by 2026. The biggest cuts will come from the investment bank and UK retail bank, with Barclays planning to strip out £700m from each division by 2026. That is likely to involve job cuts. But bosses insisted said theydid not have a “specific headcount target” for how many of its 94,400 global staff would be lose their jobs as part of that programme. The company may have front-loaded its job cuts, having slashed 5,000 roles between October and December last year. Those job cuts have cost the bank, though, with Barclays having spent £340m “rightsizing” its workforce, and another £88m towards closing and reviewing the future of more of its branches.  But bosses stressed that, despite the costs cuts, it intends to invest in the UK. Venkatakrishnan told investors that his vision was for “a Barclays which seeks to deepen and broaden its role in the UK, as it engages with the world from London”.  “We are very bullish on the UK as a place in which to do business and from which to do business,” he said, adding that he expects a rebound in listings and deal-making in London that have dried up in recent years, driving companies to US stock markets. “We are working with the government, with the regulatory agencies, and with companies to get that equity culture back in the UK to what it used to be, and to see IPOs especially …[from] technology companies, and life sciences companies,” Venkatakrishnan said. However, he admitted that “it will take some time”. Barclays bosses said it would mean the bank was able to rely on “more stable income streams” from its retail and corporate lending divisions, which account for about 35% of its income but should grow to 70% by 2026. That is meant to help increase total income to about £30bn, from about £25.4bn now, by 2026. Investors reacted positively to the strategy update and shareholder payout plans, sending shares up 6%. The bank’s annual profits were also hit by a higher impairment charge of £1.9m, indicating that more of its borrowers are believed to be at risk of falling behind on loan payments compared with 2022, when it set aside £1.2bn for potential defaults. However, most of that charge was linked to its US credit card business rather than the UK division. The overall drop in profits affected Barclays’ staff bonus pool, with top performers poised to share a marginally smaller bonus pool of £1.2m, down 3% from a year earlier. Including deferred bonuses, bankers will share £1.8bn between themselves. The bonus cuts knocked 26% off the cash bonus for Venkatakrishnan, which fell to £1.4m from £1.9m a year earlier. It meant his overall pay packet dropped 10% to £4.6m. Barclays made multimillion-pound payouts to its highest-earning bankers, with 668 receiving more than €1m (£856,000) in 2023. Twenty-eight were paid more than €5m each, while one unidentified banker took home more than €11m, more than double the chief executive’s pay packet, according to documents released alongside the Barclays annual report."

        "content": "Britain’s insecure jobs market and high housing costs are leading to the growth of a precarious middle class struggling to maintain a decent living standard on household incomes as high as £60,000 a year, a report has said. A study released by abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a research body set up by the fund manager, said the uncertain nature of work meant there was a one in three chance that someone earning a middle income today would not be doing so next year. The report – Caught in the Middle – said that problems of middle-class insecurity were especially acute for single parents, with those in employment more likely than not to be in an insecure job.   Related: Bank of England ‘risks worsening UK recession if no interest rate cuts soon’   Donald Hirsch, a policy adviser at the FFT and one of the report’s authors, said 20% of those in the middle fifth of the income distribution were struggling to pay for food and other essentials. “It is people earning between £30,000-£60,000 a year, depending on the type of household, people who you would expect to be doing OK,” he said. “Being on a middle income does not make people secure. In the present cost of living crisis, the vulnerabilities of people on modest incomes have become more apparent. They face significant uncertainties, and are rightly encouraged to save both for rainy days and their retirement,” Hirsch said. “Yet if they are also paying off student debt and have high housing costs, it becomes difficult to maintain a decent living standard today – even at the minimum level often associated with lower income groups.” The report defines work as “insecure” if someone is either self-employed or has been working for their present employer for less than two years, or less than three years if working part-time. It also classifies very low-paid full-time jobs – where pay is less than half the full-time average – as insecure. Working-age adults became more likely to be in work, but less likely to be in secure work, during the 2010s. Worklessness – combining unemployment and economic inactivity – fell from 20% to 18% over this period, but secure employment also fell, by 1.5 percentage points, while insecure employment rose by four percentage points. Hirsch said the problems of the precarious middle classes were not as severe as for those further down the income scale, but that it was important for the government to act to tackle growing insecurity. “Measures to improve predictability, stability and the right to flexible working had been promised for the present parliament, but were not delivered. In the coming parliament, this should be a priority.” The study found that more than one in four people in the middle of the income distribution were not in secure employment, and one in seven were not in secure housing. One in three of those in the middle quintile in a given year will have slipped down to a lower quintile the following year. While financial pressures on middle income families were not new, some issues had become more important. Childcare costs had outstripped other prices and earnings; housing had in many cases become less affordable; student debt had increased significantly and pension savings were becoming more important to retirement security. “Some groups are clearly more vulnerable than others. Single adults and lone parents have less security and resilience than couples. People in privately rented accommodation face the double disadvantage of high housing costs and low security,” the report said. “Younger adults are more likely than older ones to have insecure work, higher housing costs and be repaying student debt.” In addition to measures to provide greater employment security, the report said more needed to be done to boost the protection given to tenants in the private rented sector. The renters reform bill – which is going through parliament – was an important step, the report said. It argued that more should be done to ensure the rising earnings of those on middle incomes were not cancelled out by childcare costs, and to increase the amount of contributions made by employers and government to pensions."

        "content": "Union leaders have warned business groups against pushing Keir Starmer to dilute plans for sweeping reforms of workers’ rights and for a ban on zero-hours contracts. As the Labour leader comes under pressure from industry to scale back its shake-up of employment laws, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the plans were “extremely popular” with voters and good for the economy. Calling on employers to “get on board” with Labour’s plans, the unions’ umbrella body published analysis showing as many as two-thirds of workers on zero-hours contracts had been with their current employer for more than a year.   Related: Amazon accused of using ‘union-busting’ tactics at Midlands warehouses   It said that this showed the overwhelming majority of workers on the contracts are “stuck” in a position of insecure employment, which was leading to bad employers “parking workers on zero-hours contracts for years on end”. It found a minority of zero-hours contract workers were on them as a stopgap, temporary measure, with as few as 7% having been with their current employer less than three months. The TUC’s intervention comes after the president of the CBI lobby group, Rupert Soames, said this month that it was pushing Labour to soften its plans amid business concerns the measures could undermine economic growth. Labour has pledged to ban zero-hours contracts, end fire-and-rehire practices and introduce “day-one” employment rights as part of a “new deal for working people” within the first 100 days of taking office. Although business leaders are understood to be largely supportive of the party’s ambitions, some lobby groups have questioned whether a rushed introduction of the plan could cause “unintended consequences” and hurt the economy. Ahead of the general election, Labour has scaled back its £28bn green investment package and sought to win favour among business leaders by pledging not to increase corporation tax or reverse the government’s decision to scrap a cap on bankers’ bonuses. However, the TUC said strengthening workers’ rights was a vote-winning policy among the electorate. Recent polling carried out on behalf of the union body in the autumn showed almost two-thirds of UK adults support a ban on zero-hours contracts, including 60% of 2019 Conservative voters. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Employers need to get on board with Labour’s new deal for working people – and good employers will. “The UK’s long experiment with a low-rights, low-wage economy is a complete failure. The Tories’ lack of an economic plan for jobs, growth and living standards has cost workers and industry dear. Labour’s New Deal for Working People stands in stark contrast to the Conservative’s dire record. “And it would be good for our economy too. Decent, secure jobs are essential to building a motivated, healthy, innovative workforce – all vital for high productivity growth.”"

        "content": "A Chinese e-commerce company has said it is considering making an offer for Currys, sending the electronics retailer’s shares soaring amid hopes of a bidding war with private equity investor Elliott. The share price of Currys surged by a third on Monday morning after JD.com revealed it was “in the very preliminary stages” of a cash takeover bid. It faces competition from Elliott, which also on Monday confirmed it was considering an offer. Currys said on Sunday it had rejected a £700m preliminary offer from the US investment group, saying it “significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects”.   Related: Currys board should play hardball with opportunistic bidders | Nils Pratley   The UK electronics retailer’s share price closed up 36% on Monday. It peaked at 64.9p, its highest since March, although far below its peak of £5 a share at the end of 2015. The company was valued at £533m on Friday evening before the takeover approaches were first reported. Currys was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1927. It is now a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies. In 2021, Currys shifted its strategy to merge the four brands it operated – which included PC World, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse – into one central brand. It also shut 531 standalone Carphone Warehouse stores in 2020, with the loss of 2,900 jobs. The retailer has struggled in the last two years with high inflation hitting demand across all of its markets. In July, it cancelled its dividend and cut spending in its Scandinavian operations. Clive Black, the head of consumer research at Shore Capital, a stockbroker, said the bids were a sign of “the perils of lowly rated British equities, which have been selectively picked off for acquisition, often by private capital, in recent times”. Black added that the “performance and competence” of the UK government had pushed down the share prices of UK companies, leaving them vulnerable to foreign takeovers. However, Black said he saw “brightening prospects” for UK consumers as inflation slows, which should benefit consumer goods firms who have been hit by a slowing economy. Currys’ largest shareholder is Redwheel, an asset manager formerly known as RWC, with a 15% stake, according to S&P Capital Market Intelligence. Other shareholders include Frasers, the retail group owned by Mike Ashley that has bought stakes or taken over several struggling British brands. Both Elliott and JD.com said there was no certainty that they would make a binding offer."

        "content": "It’s a long time since anybody described Currys, or Dixons as it was in a former incarnation, as a jewel of the London stock market. The electricals retailer was relegated from the FTSE 100 index as long ago as 2017, soon after its foolish value-destroying merger with Carphone Warehouse. These days it exists in that sub-£1bn category of under-analysed stocks that struggle to generate investor interest, at least from traditional funds that used to be the bedrock of the market. A takeover by private equity or an overseas predator has looked a possible plotline for a while, given how far the value has dropped from the £3.8bn at the time of the Carphone combo. There was no great shock in the news that the US hedge fund Elliott, a happy owner of the Waterstones bookshop chain, made an offer at the end of last week. The appearance of JD.com, one of China’s answers to Amazon, as a potential rival bidder is more surprising but, again, one can see the logic. Currys, despite it all, still generates annual revenues of almost £10bn and enjoys market-leading positions in the UK and Scandinavia, which is enough to get on to international radars. But one hopes this saga doesn’t turn into a familiar tale of a UK company departing for less than it’s worth because local investors are too disengaged. There is a fair case that Currys is worth substantially more than Elliott’s opening shot of 62p a share, or £700m.   Related: Currys shares soar as Chinese online retailer enters takeover battle   The board of Currys rightly rejected that effort as a “significant” undervaluation, and one hopes the directors will say the same about offers several rungs up the ladder. Yes, the shares, up 38% at 65p on Monday, traded at 47p last week but broker Peel Hunt, for one, reckons there’s no need for the board to engage at anything less than 80p. Over at Investec, analysts had a 78p target price before the fun even started. None of which is to deny that Currys has frustrated its long-term owners. The Carphone merger was one of the worst deals in modern retailing history – the mobile phone market shifted and all the standalone phone shops were closed in 2020. Then, after the Covid surge in demand for electrical goods, the previously reliable Nordic business ran into stiffer local competition and Currys was caught half asleep. The point, though, is that the position now looks stable. The chief executive, Alex Baldock, last month nudged up this year’s pre-tax profits guidance to £105m-£115m. A complication in the background is a deficit in the pension fund of about £250m that will require top-up payments for several years, limiting cash for dividends. On the other side of the ledger, the group should soon be debt-free after agreeing the sale of its Greek business for £156m. If the ambition to achieve a 3% profit margin in the core operations is credible – it ought to be – the germ of a turnaround story is in place. The consumer weather should also improve when interest rates start to fall. At 62p, Currys would have been valued at just seven times next year’s projected earnings, on Peel Hunt’s numbers. Even in a soggy retail sector, that’s a miserable rating. There will be several more rounds of this saga to come, one suspects, but the job of Currys’ board is to play hardball. If the opportunistic bidders can’t be pushed close to £1bn, there is no shame in staying independent."

The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, said it had opened official proceedings against the Chinese-owned short video platform over a potential breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA). It said the investigation was looking at areas including protection of minors, maintaining records of its advertising content and whether its algorithms led users down damaging content “rabbit holes”.

The supermarket has now begun pricing per unit, such as gram or millilitre, on Clubcard discounts making it easier for shoppers to compare prices between different sized packs. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said:  “The lack of unit pricing on Tesco’s Clubcard offers was a glaring omission and we warned that this approach could be breaking the law last summer, so it’s good to see the nation’s largest supermarket stepping up to do the right thing by making this important change. We look forward to seeing this rolled out quickly across all stores and online so shoppers can benefit as soon as possible.

Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.41pm GMT   The shekel weakened slightly on the news that Israel’s economy shrank at an annualised rate of almost 20% in the last quarter. Bloomberg reports:  [The shekel] was trading 0.5% down at 3.626 per dollar at 3:09 p.m. in Tel Aviv, heading for its first drop in four days. Stocks initially pared advances, but soon extended them.      12.56pm GMT   Despite the economic problems in countries such as the UK, Germany and now Israel, Goldman Sachs are more upbeat about stock market prospects this year. The Wall Street titan has lifted its rating on global equities to “overweight” on prospects of economic growth and recovery in manufacturing activity, up from a previous rating of “neutral”. Goldman says:  We expect growth to become a more important driver of risk appetite and equity/bond correlations should be more negative this year.      12.24pm GMT   Israel’s sharp drop in GDP in the October-December quarter is the latest piece of bad economic news for the country. CNN reports:  The conflict is expected to cost Israel around 255 billion shekels ($70.3 billion) by the end of 2025, equivalent to around 13% of GDP, according to the Bank of Israel. In November, the central bank cut its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2%, from an estimate of 3% on the eve of the war. And earlier this month, Moody’s delivered Israel’s first ever credit rating downgrade, citing elevated political risk and deteriorating public finances stemming from the war.      12.05pm GMT  Israel on brink of recession after GDP shrinks in Q4  Israel is on the brink of a technical recession after its economy shrank sharply after the war with Hamas began. Israel’s GDP contracted at an annualised rate of 19.4% in the final quarter of 2023, new data from the Central Bureau of Statistics shows. That’s the equivalent of a quarterly drop of almost 5% during the quarter.  #Israel Q4 #GDP annualised basis falls 19.4% quarter-on-quarter vs estimate of 10.5% decline: Bloomberg— Stock market news tracker_DS (@deepika63379858) February 19, 2024  [explanation: Annualised GDP extrapolates a quarterly change in activity to show how much an economy would grow, or shrank, if it was continued over a whole year] The statistic bureau says:  “The contraction of the economy in the fourth quarter of 2023 was directly affected by the outbreak of the Iron Swords War on October 7,”  The Times of Israel reports that this is the deepest decline since the second quarter of 2020, when pandemic lockdowns hit consumer spending and left many businesses closed. Reuters reports that the economy was hit by a 26.9% drop in private spending, an 18.3% fall in exports and 67.8% slide in investment in fixed assets, especially in residential building. Government spending, mainly on war expenses, jumped 88.1%. Israel’s economy grew at an annualised rate of 1.8% in the third quarter of 2023, down from a previous estimate of 2.7%. That’s the equivalent of 0.45% growth in Q3. A technical recession is defined as two quarterly falls in GDP in a row.  Updated at 12.10pm GMT    11.12am GMT  Bundesbank: Germany likely to be falling into technical recession  Germany is likely to follow the UK into a technical recession, the country’s central bank has warned today. The Bundesbank has warned that economic output is likely to decline again, slightly, in the first quarter of this year, following the drop in the final quarter of 2023. That would put Germany into a technical recession, the Bundesbank points out in its latest monthly report, adding:  While this would mean the ongoing period of weakness in the German economy following the start of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine would continue, there is still no evidence of a recession in the sense of a persistent, broad-based and distinct drop in economic activity, nor is such a recession currently on the cards.  The Bundesbank also warns that there is “no recovery in the German economy yet”, pointing to factors such as a drop in foreign industrial demand, cautious consumer spending, and higher funding costs which may constrain domestic investment.

Bloomberg reported today that game-makers have been told Nintento is pushing back the launch of its Switch successor to the beginning of 2025, rather than later this year as expected. Some of Nintendo’s partners were advised not to expect the still-unannounced console until March 2025 at the earliest, Bloomberg adds. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says:  “The release of a next generation console is a big staging post for a games company so it’s no surprise investors have reacted with shock and disquiet to speculation Nintendo may not get its new iteration of the Switch to market this year. Reports say the company is guiding its game publishing partners that the new machine won’t hit the shelves until the early months of 2025.  “While a blow, the importance attached to these releases means ultimately it is sensible for Nintendo to delay if it means the finished product is released without any technical issues.  “Nintendo has enjoyed a renaissance over the last decade or so, with the release of Pokémon Go and the success of the original Switch helping to make the brand relevant to a whole new generation of gamers.  “More recently, the company has been tapping into its catalogue of IP and the massive success of the Super Mario Bros movie lights up a big potential avenue for licensing revenue in the future.  “Nintendo also benefits from its cross-generational appeal with less sophisticated hardware which is cheaper to make, helping to underpin strong margins on its flagship console when for rivals these sales are a loss leader.”   Nintendo shares fell after reports by games media and Bloomberg that its next-generation console will be delayed until early 2025 from later this year https://t.co/wYX3bCq0Ic pic.twitter.com/53LUiiUHTJ— Reuters (@Reuters) February 19, 2024      9.46am GMT   The FTSE 100 index is flat, despite AstraZeneca jumping 3.3% after it reported that its Tagrisso drug had shown a “statistically significant and highly clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival” for patients with lung cancer. Tagrisso, plus chemotherapy has been approved for use in the US, AstraZeneca also reported this morning.     9.46am GMT   European stock markets have begun the new week with small losses. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has dipped by 0.2% this morning. This is led by a 0.5% drop on France’s CAC 40, after French finance minister Bruno Le Maire yesterday lowered France’s 2024 economic growth forecast to 1% and announced plans to cut spending by €10 billion.     9.19am GMT   Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the Bank of England will cut interest rates in May. They point out that last week’s flurry of economic data showed the UK unemployment rate fell to 3.%, while retail sales rebounded by 3.4% – and inflation was lower than expected at 4%. Goldman say:  In sum, the tighter labour market and increased sales activity would skew risks towards a first cut in June. Even so, the January inflation print surprised to the downside and supports our economists’ expectation of a first cut in May.  Goldman’s economists also lowered their 2024 GDP growth forecast to 0.4% last week, down from 0.6% previously.     9.03am GMT   Price comparison site MoneySupermarket has reported record revenues, as consumers try to avoid insurance price hikes. MoneySupermarket’s revenues swelled by 11% year-on-year in 2023, to £432m, which it attributes to “exceptional trading in Insurance”. It explains:  Car and home insurance premiums have increased significantly because of the rising cost of claims.  However, there was no “material revenue” from energy switching, because there are very few tariffs cheaper than Ofgem’s price cap for households to move to.     8.30am GMT  Rental growth drops back to single digits  Elsewhere in Britain’s property sector, growth in rental costs have slowed to a 13-month low. Estate agent Hamptons reports that the average rents on newly let properties rose 8.3% across Great Britain in the year to January. That’s the lowest rental inflation in just over a year, after it peaked at 12% in August. Hamptons reports that 59% of landlords achieved a higher rent when a new tenant moved in last month, down from a peak of 81% in January 2022. Rents jumped as the Bank of England started to raise interest rates at the end of 2021, meaning higher borrowing costs for landlords who rolled onto new mortgage deals. But rental growth is likely to remain sticky, Hamptons predicts, and run ahead of inflation for the remainder of 2024.  8 of the 11 regions in UK saw the pace of rental growth slow between Aug 2023 & Jan 2024. London’s rental growth was the most tautly reigned in by affordability pressures from 17.1% to 8.1%.

US investment group Elliott and China’s e-commerce group JD.com are both circling Currys. Currys confirmed yesterday it had rejected a takeover bid from Elliott, worth 62p per share, saying the offer significantly undervalued its business.

JD.com says:  There can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for Currys, nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made. A further announcement will be made if and when appropriate.  Currys was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1927. Currys’ shares have hit nearly 65p this morning, up from 47p on Friday night, their highest level since March 2023.  Updated at 9.40am GMT    8.09am GMT  Government outlines new curbs on short-term lets in England  The UK government has announced proposals to rein in the growth of short-term holiday lets in tourist hotspots in England – but they won’t prevent the practice. Changes in planning rules announced today will mean:  Planning permission will be required for future short-term lets A mandatory national register will provide valuable information and help ensure accommodation is safe Homeowners can continue to let out their own main or sole home for up to 90 nights a year  The government says its proposals will give communities greater control over future growth in short-term lets, to prevent a “hollowing out” of communities, and address anti-social behaviour. Under the reforms councils will be given greater power to control short-term lets by making them subject to the planning process. Last April, the governmnent proposed that people who convert homes into short-term holiday lets would require planning permission in tourist hotspots in England.   Related: Holiday homes in England to need planning permission under new plans   Today they are also confirming that a new mandatory national register will give local authorities the information they need about short-term lets in their area. Airbnb, which has helped drive the growth in short-term letting, has welcomed the government’s plans (which is a sign that the proposals are unlikely to damage the market much!). Amanda Cupples, general manager for Northern Europe at Airbnb, says:   The introduction of a short-term lets register is good news for everyone. Families who Host on Airbnb will benefit from clear rules that support their activity, and local authorities will get access to the information they need to assess and manage housing impacts and keep communities healthy, where necessary.   Updated at 8.45am GMT    8.07am GMT  UK house asking prices rise: What the experts say  Here’s some reaction to Rightmove’s report that UK house asking prices rose again this month, from Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance:  “As confidence starts to creep back into the market due to the reduction in mortgage rates and lower inflation, we are seeing higher sales volumes, with vendors encouraged to sell. “Encouragingly, while sales have picked up, vendors are pricing correctly in order to attract buyers. This, in turn, is making a property purchase more affordable and appealing to buyers. Unless there is some dramatic intervention from the Government, we don’t expect to see a huge increase in pricing in the forthcoming 12 months or so.”   Agreed sales get a 3% boost on 2019 levels for the first 6wks of 2024.

Misguided pricing will be detrimental thou as savvy buyers only move on those priced right  @rightmove pic.twitter.com/ziydpP3tVx— Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) February 19, 2024  Nigel Bishop of buying agency Recoco Property Search says:   “We have seen first-hand that buyer confidence has returned to some degree, particularly if compared to this time last year. This uplift in market activity is largely driven by the availability of more affordable mortgage products but also falling inflation. Equally, sellers have become more motivated to put their property up for sale which is resulting in buyers having a larger pool of properties to choose from. House hunters at the higher end of the market, of homes priced £2mn and above, however, are generally less dependent on a mortgage and remain cautious amid the potential impact of this year’s election and upcoming Spring Budget. Cash or chain-free buyers who are currently making an offer are less likely to settle on the seller’s asking price and willing to enter tough price negotiations.”      7.40am GMT  Lunar New Year tourism picks up in China, but foreign direct investment slows  There’s some encouraging economic data from China this morning as the Lunar New Year break ends, and some less positive statistics too. On the upside, tourism revenues in China during the Lunar New Year holiday surged by 47.3% year-on-year and surpassed 2019 levels. Domestic tourism spending hit 632.7 billion yuan (£69.7bn), according to government figures, thanks to a domestic travel boom amid a longer-than-usual break.  #China Lunar New Year Tourism Revenue (18 Feb): +47.3% y/y to 633b yuan, 7.7% higher than 2019’s pre Covid levels #OOTT #OPEC— Nitin Kashimpuria (@nkashimpuria9) February 19, 2024  Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says:  The week starts with the soothing news that the Chinese traveled and spent more than they did in the same period of 2019. As such, the Chinese stock markets return from the CNY break on a cheery note.  The CSI 300 index of Chinese stocks is up 1.1% today. Dampening the mood, though, is data showing that foreign businesses’ direct investment (FDI) into China last year increased by the lowest amount since the early 1990s. China’s direct investment liabilities, a broad measure of FDI, rose by $33bn in 2023, down 81.7% from 2022, according to data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange released on Sunday. The slowdown commes amid rising tensions with the West which are making it harder for China to attract foreign capital.  Updated at 7.43am GMT    7.14am GMT   Before he left the BoE in 2021, Andy Haldane warned – presciently – that an inflationary “tiger” had woken up and was prowling the economy. The Bank didn’t react, and only started raising interest rates in December 2021 – and has been criticised for this tardiness. Haldane now points out that failing to cut rates in a timely fashion will compound the error. He tells Bloomberg’s UK Politics podcast:  “It’s one thing to have missed inflation on the way up, which happened, it’s quite another to then have crushed the economy on the way down. “That double blow to credibility is one if I were a central banker, in my old job, I would be looking to avoid.”      7.10am GMT  BOE risks deepening UK’s recession, Andy Haldane warns  The Bank of England risks making the UK’s recession worse unless it cuts interest rates soon, the central bank’s former chief economist has warned. Andy Haldane, who left the Bank in 2021 after a 32-year stint, says his former colleagues should consider loosening policy to support the economy. Concerns over the economy have risen since the UK fell into a technical recession at the end of last year, GDP data released last Thursday showed. Some economists have predicted that the economy is picking up this year. But, asked whether the BOE could worsen the recession unless it loosened policy soon, Haldane told Bloomberg’s UK Politics podcast:  “I think that’s where the balance of risks lies, yes.” “For me the case for putting in place some upfront, early insurance on the monetary policy side is strong and strengthening, and I’m fearful we leave that insurance a little too late in the year.”   The Bank of England risks deepening the UK’s recession if it doesn’t pivot to interest-rate cuts soon, its former chief economist Andy Haldane warns https://t.co/TIgA4uguNX— Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 19, 2024  Eaarlier this month the BoE left interest rates on hold at 5.25%, with just one of its nine policymakers voting for a cut (two wanted a rise).

Updated at 7.27am GMT    7.08am GMT  Introduction: Average price tag on a UK home up £3,000 in February  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. The UK property market is picking up this month, at least for sellers who price their homes correctly. Property portal Rightmove reports this morning that the average asking price for a home rose by 0.9% or £3,091 this month to £362,839. The increase means sellers are asking 0.1% more for their homes than a year ago, on average, as the fall in asking prices last year is reversed. Rightmove reports that momentum is building in the market, with 7% more new listings coming to market than last year, and a 7% rise in the number of buyers making enquiries too. Agreed sales in the first six weeks of 2024 are 16% higher than over the same period last year, when the market was reeling from the jump in mortgage costs after the mini-budget of September 2022. Rightmove’s Tim Bannister suggests sellers should take advantage of the situation while it lasts. He says:  Mortgage rates have fallen considerably from their peak and are now remaining broadly stable after the uncertainty of late 2022 and 2023. Momentum to move in 2024 is continuing to build, but prospective sellers mustn’t get carried away. Buyers now have more choice of property for sale and many are still very price-sensitive, with mortgage rates remaining elevated. Sellers who are serious about moving this year would be well-advised to ride this wave of increased buyer confidence with an attractive asking price before any pre-election jitters or unexpected events dampen the momentum.

        "content": "The platinum arm of Anglo American is to cut 3,700 jobs in South Africa as the British mining company attempts to improve performance in the troubled division. Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) said on Monday it aimed to cut jobs after a sharp drop in platinum metal prices, which had led to a collapse in profits last year. The jobs under threat account for about one-fifth of the Johannesburg-based company’s total workforce, with Amplats also reviewing the roles of an additional 620 contractors. Profits at Amplats, in which Anglo American holds a 79% stake, fell to R14bn (£586m) in 2023, down by 71% from R48.8bn in 2022. The business attributed the fall to “macroeconomic uncertainty”, as well as a 35% fall in price of platinum group metals. The fall was driven by the drop in value of palladium and rhodium, important materials used in the catalytic converters for petrol and diesel cars. Demand has taken a hit as more carmakers ramp up production of electric vehicles. Amplats’ struggles will come as another headache for Anglo American, one of the biggest companies on London’s FTSE 100, which has lost billions of pounds off its value in recent months. Analysts suggested in December that the mining company had become a takeover target after its stocked dropped by 45% across 2023. Craig Miller, the chief executive of Amplats, said the company had implemented several cost-cutting initiatives to address the global and local challenges but the “protracted low-price initiative” meant further measures were needed. Anglo American, which is also the main shareholder in De Beers, the world’s largest diamond miner, is scheduled to report its annual results on Thursday. Investors will be keen to see any signs of a turnaround. Amplats will begin a consultation period with trade unions and non-unionised staff, with the final number of job cuts coming after this period. The company has operations across northern South Africa. Miller said the decision had been taken as a “last resort” for the company and it acknowledged that the job cuts would have a “socioeconomic impact” on workers, their families and local communities. He said: “These actions are necessary to continue the employ of thousands of workers and contractors who will continue to add value for our stakeholders – through salaries, taxes and royalties, as well as procurement of goods and services from local suppliers.”"

        "content": "It may charge nearly £700 for its most expensive steak but even the flamboyant condiment-sprinkling chef Salt Bae’s London restaurant is turning off the heating amid soaring energy bills. Nusr-Et steakhouse, the outlet at the Park Tower hotel in Knightsbridge known for expensive dishes such as £680 wagyu striploin or £630 giant tomahawk steak, said it had made an effort to save energy despite recording a jump in profits. The company, which was founded by Salt Bae, a Turkish butcher turned steak-monger whose real name is Nusret Gökçe, said pre-tax profits rose 44% to almost £3.3m in 2022 as sales soared almost 66% to £13.6m in accounts filed this week at Companies House.   Related: ‘We block 10 people a day’: culture war trolls add to UK vegan restaurants’ struggles   Owners of the London outpost, described by the Observer critic Jay Rayner as a “ludicrous restaurant”, received dividends of £2.8m, up from almost £2m a year before. The restaurant, which launched in 2021, has cut its prices in recent years and ditched signature items such as the £1,450 gold-covered steak during the cost of living crisis. The only gold-covered item now on the menu, once glittering with gilded meat, is a £50 pistachio baklava. In its accounts, the group said it had “sought to improve energy efficiency at an operational level” with efforts including “turning off central heating after closing or during peak hours when heating demand is lower” and turning off lights during closing hours. The group said it had also tried limiting the operational hours of the “air curtain” – the system used to prevent draughts through doors. It said it was “committed to operational efficiency” and its renovation of the London restaurant included LED lights and “energy saving insulation”. In a statement provided after publication, the restaurant said that the savings were part of efforts “to reduce our brand’s overall carbon footprint”. Energy prices soared during 2022 as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed up wholesale gas prices. Businesses have attempted to counter the rise in bills: retailers dimmed lights and lowered the thermostat, while restaurants and pubs have cut staffing hours, simplified menus or been forced to shut. Businesses also struggled with rising bills and problems related to Covid and Brexit during 2022. However, the directors of Nusret UK said the restaurant group, which is controlled by the Turkish conglomerate Doğuş Group, said it had performed better than predicted in the last three months of 2021, when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 affected the hospitality industry, and in line with expectations in 2022. Fans, who reportedly include David Beckham and Leonardo DiCaprio, are attracted partly by the chance to meet Salt Bae. He has gathered almost 54 million Instagram followers after he shot to fame via a video of him completing his elaborate steak-salting move while sporting a tight white T-shirt and dark glasses. Shortly after the London branch opened, a photograph of a £1,812.40 receipt for a table of six, including selling £1.40 cans of Red Bull for £11, went viral. The furore helped the restaurant take £7m in its first three months after opening. However, Salt Bae’s social media star has dimmed more recently, with a backlash after he gained “undue access” to the pitch after the World Cup final in Qatar in 2022. Last year, his Manhattan burger joint closed, three years after it was declared “the worst restaurant in NYC right now”. • This article was amended on 21 February 2024. A previous version said that the Nusr-Et steakhouse in London had been forced to cut its heating bills in order to save money. The restaurant told the Guardian after publication that the measures described were primarily to reduce its carbon footprint."

        "content": "The Bank of England risks making the UK’s recession worse unless it cuts interest rates soon to ease the pressure on households amid the cost of living crisis, its former chief economist has warned. Andy Haldane, who had been a leading advocate of raising interest rates before leaving the central bank in 2021, said there was a danger that the Bank could “crush the economy” by keeping borrowing costs at the highest level in 16 years. Official figures released on Thursday showed Britain’s economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed consumers cut back on spending in response to high interest rates and elevated living costs.   Related: Bank of England ‘could worsen recession’ without interest rate cuts soon; Israel’s economy shrinks in Q4 – business live   UK gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and sharp decline in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter. Economists regard two consecutive quarters of falling GDP as the definition of a recession. Asked whether there was a danger the Bank could make the recession worse unless it cut interest rates soon, Haldane told Bloomberg’s UK Politics podcast: “That’s where the balance of risks lies, yes. “For me the case for putting in place some upfront, early insurance on the monetary policy side is strong and strengthening, and I’m fearful we leave that insurance a little too late in the year.” Financial markets expect the Bank to begin cutting rates this summer from the current level of 5.25%, with a first reduction in borrowing costs anticipated from as early as June. Investors are pricing in a 17% chance of a cut in May, with the probability of a June cut at almost 50%. It comes after inflation held steady at 4% in January, defying expectations for a modest increase, after the first monthly fall in food prices for two years offset rising energy costs. Inflation had peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, a 41-year high. The Bank’s policymakers have warned, however, that the UK faces ongoing inflationary risks from a tight jobs market and rising prices in the services sector of the economy. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, and three other members of its rate-setting monetary policy committee are expected to give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee on Tuesday. Threadneedle Street had faced criticism for holding back on the start of its interest rate raising cycle until December 2021, when borrowing costs were set at a record low of 0.1%. Haldane was among critics at that time who warned higher rates were required to tackle soaring inflation. However, the Bank’s former chief economist, who is now the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank, has suggested he would have backed interest rate cuts from the end of last year as inflationary pressures fade and economic activity comes under pressure from higher borrowing costs. “It’s one thing to have missed inflation on the way up, which happened, it’s quite another to then have crushed the economy on the way down,” Haldane said. “That double blow to credibility is one if I were a central banker, in my old job, I would be looking to avoid.”"

The ship is believed to be Belize-flagged, Lebanese-operated and UK-registered. Since 11 January, the UK and the US have carried out joint airstrikes against Houthi rebels to try to stop attacks on commercial shipping. Those strikes were also supported by Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. The Houthi rebels – who are supplied, trained and advised by Iran – have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea since November over Israel’s offensive in Gaza. They have often targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperilling shipping in a key route for trade between Asia, the Middle East and Europe."

        "content": "Apple is reportedly facing a €500m fine from the EU over restrictions on access to music streaming services, in what would be a landmark blow to the US tech company. The European Commission is investigating whether Apple blocked music streamers from telling users about cheaper ways to subscribe outside its app store where it takes a significant cut of revenues. According to the Financial Times, Brussels plans to impose a fine of €500m (£427m), which would represent a landmark ruling against Apple after years of complaints from companies whose services are delivered via iPhone apps. The Swedish streaming company Spotify filed a complaint with the EU in 2019, claiming that Apple limits choice and competition in its app store by charging a 30% fee on all purchases. Apple also prevented Spotify and other companies from informing customers on their phones that they could avoid the commission – and get a better deal – simply by signing up on Spotify’s website. Apple says its fee is justified because it spends heavily on providing a secure app store, and provides Spotify with access to hundreds of millions of customers. However, Spotify argues that Apple’s own music streaming service, Apple Music, does not face the same extra cost, giving it an advantage and making the fees anti-competitive. The European Commission will say Apple’s actions are illegal and go against the bloc’s rules that enforce competition in the single market, according to the FT, which cited five people close to the investigation. The commission could also reportedly ban the practice of blocking music services from advertising cheaper subscriptions outside the platform. Apple has never faced a competition fine from the European Commission, although it received a €1.1bn fine from France in 2020 – subsequently revised down to around €370m on appeal – for anti-competitive agreements with two wholesalers. However, it and other big tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over competition concerns. Google is appealing against fines of more than €8bn levied by the EU in three separate competition investigations. Apple defeated a lawsuit by the Fortnite developer Epic Games that claimed that the app store was an illegal monopoly, but Epic in December won a similar cases against Google, which operates the Android mobile phone software. Last month, Apple said it would allow EU customers to download apps without going through its own app store, a response to the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. The law, the details of which were revealed last year, introduces new obligations for “gatekeepers” including Amazon, Google and Amazon who hold particularly powerful positions in controlling mobile phone software choices. The European Commission declined to comment. Apple did not provide fresh comment, but pointed to a previous statement saying it would respond to the commission’s concerns “while promoting competition and choice for European consumers”."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-19T05:00:04+00:00",
        "content": "Ministers have been urged by Citizens Advice to protect consumers from a hike in household energy bills to pay for the proposed Sizewell C power station, amid international tensions over the rising costs of nuclear projects. The UK’s largest independent advice provider has raised concerns that the project in Suffolk may offer “poor value for money” and called for greater clarity on its funding, in a letter to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. Estimates of the cost of Sizewell C vary wildy – from £20bn to £44bn – and a process to find international investors to join the UK government and France’s EDF is ongoing. Last month, the owner of Sizewell C’s sister project, EDF’s Hinkley Point C in Somerset, said it would be delayed to 2031 and cost up to £35bn, blaming inflation, Covid and Brexit. This could reach £47.9bn under its worst-case scenario. On Friday, EDF said it had taken a €12.9bn hit on the project. EDF, which is wholly owned by the French government, is on the hook for cost overruns at Hinkley. French officials have lobbied the UK government to share the burden of the extra costs after its Chinese partner, CGN, was removed from the Sizewell C project over security fears. However, Sizewell C has a different funding structure to Hinkley, exposing households to potential overruns. Sizewell C Ltd, the entity behind the project, updated its electricity licence to allow a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model to be implemented. RAB financing models, which have been used in the construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel and Heathrow Terminal 5, are designed to encourage investment by offering a guaranteed income for investors during the construction phase of a large project and bring down financing costs, with the cost added to bills. In a response to the consultation on the licence update, Citizens Advice chief energy economist Richard Hall said: “By providing investors with a relatively guaranteed income stream, and one that commences during the construction phase, it can be convincingly argued that applying the RAB model to new nuclear projects could reduce the cost of capital that consumers have to pay. “Our concern has been, and remains, that consumers are not simply exposed to the cost of capital, but also the volume of capital that needs to be employed. If the volume of capital required balloons, the project may offer consumers poor value for money even if it is cheaply financed.” He added: “Looking at new nuclear projects in general, and the type envisaged at Sizewell C in particular, the scope for material cost and time overruns is very significant. Consumers need to be protected from those risks. They have no way to manage them, and are reliant on the [energy] department to take steps to ensure that they are not on the hook for cost or time overruns.” Hall also raised concerns over proposals for advertising and publicity costs included in the licence consultation. “Billpayers should not be paying for the Sizewell C sales pitch,” he said. The latest estimates of the cost of Sizewell C, conducted by University of Greenwich Business School and seen by the Guardian, forecast that it would cost £38.4bn and be complete in 2039. Its analysis suggests that the consumer surcharge to fund it would rise from £4.07 a year in the first year of the project, to £27.82 in year 15, costing households an extra £239.21 in total during its construction. Alison Downes of the Stop Sizewell C campaign said: “The government emphasise that Hinkley Point C is EDF’s risk and responsibility, but when Sizewell C overspends and overruns – as it inevitably will – future ministers will have to explain why it was considered acceptable to put its construction risk on to consumers and taxpayers. Why has the Hinkley fiasco not taught the government that a RAB-funded Sizewell is a bad idea?” The government has so far spent more than £1bn on the Sizewell C project, which is expected to create 70,000 jobs, and ultimately power 6m homes. Last year, the Observer revealed that the British Gas owner Centrica – a minority investor in Britain’s nuclear power stations – was interested. Its boss, Chris O’Shea, last week confirmed it remains interested. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “Projects like Sizewell C will mean cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy in the long-term. “We anticipate charges for large-scale nuclear projects to be around just £1 a month on an average household bill. “Our model can deliver greater value for money for consumers by lowering the cost of financing construction, one of the biggest drivers of new nuclear project costs.”"

        "content": "The world’s five largest listed oil companies have made profits of more than a quarter of a trillion dollars since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to dramatic increases in energy prices and household bills. The “super-majors” – BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies – have made $281bn (£223bn) since the war began in February 2022, according to Global Witness. The UK-based pair, BP and Shell, have made a combined $94.2bn (£75bn) in profits since the conflict began. Global Witness estimates that this is enough to cover all Britain’s household electricity bills for 17 consecutive months. Shell, which has made $58.9bn (£47bn) in profits since the second quarter of 2022, is also in the process of cutting up to 330 roles from its low-carbon solutions unit in a renewed focus on high-profit oil projects this year. BP, which last year also moved to scale back its climate goals, has made $35bn (£28bn) in profits since the start of the conflict. The European and US majors – Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies – have made combined profits of more than $187bn (£148bn). “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been devastating for millions of people, from ordinary Ukrainians living under the shadow of war, to the households across Europe struggling to heat their homes,” said Global Witness’s senior fossil fuels investigator, Patrick Galey. “This analysis shows that, regardless of what happens on the frontlines, the fossil fuel majors are the main winners of the war in Ukraine.” The profits of international shipping companies and foodstuff suppliers have also soar over the last two years, leading some economists to call for targeted price controls during an emergency. Shell made a U-turn last summer on a pledge to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade in a strategic shift to target fossil fuels and “reward our shareholders today and far into the future”. The five super-majors are forecast to reward investors with record payouts of more than $100bn (£79bn) in 2023 when figures for the full financial year are published in the coming weeks, despite growing public outrage and criticism of the fossil fuel profit machine. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said companies were likely to pay shareholders even more this year despite weaker commodity market prices leading to lower profits. The big oil companies enriched shareholders with dividend payments and share buy-backs worth $104bn in 2022, according to the IEEFA. “They are now spending their gains on investor handouts and ever more oil and gas production which Europe doesn’t even need and the climate cannot take,” said Galey. “This is yet another way in which the fossil fuel industry is failing consumers and the planet.” Last year was the hottest year on record by a huge margin, driving heatwaves, floods and wildfires, damaging lives and livelihoods across the world. Analysis showed some extreme weather, such as heatwaves in Europe and the US, would have been virtually impossible without human-caused global heating. Isabella Weber, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has charted the rising profits of corporations in the food, shipping and oil and gas sectors. She told members of the European parliament earlier this month that targeted price controls were needed to prevent firms exploiting a crisis to drive up profit margins and shareholder dividends at the expense of customers. “The energy crisis has been the worst of times for most Europeans, but the best of times for energy companies. When emergencies mean record profits in essential sectors, public and corporate interests are not aligned. We need a new playbook of emergency economics. “This raises the question of whether we can entrust the systemically significant sectors purely to these private corporations that have learned that … in the worst shock … Europe has experienced in recent history, they have reaped the largest profits in their whole history.”"

        "content": "Private firms that lease out trains for Britain’s railway have seen their profits treble in a year, with more than £400m paid in dividends, official figures show. The rolling stock companies paid out a total of £409.7m to shareholders and profit margins rose to 41.6% in 2022-23, according to the Office of Rail and Road, as the rest of the railway was told to make swingeing cuts and salaries were frozen. Taxpayer subsidies are still running at twice pre-pandemic levels. Unions have urged a windfall tax on the huge dividends, describing the financing of trains as a “racket” without risk to the leasing firms. Financial analysis by the ORR, the rail regulator, shows that although the total in leasing costs paid by train operators fell slightly last year to £3.1bn, it is still almost 30% higher than five years ago, in a period when overall rail industry staff costs remained static. The ORR said the rolling stock companies, or Roscos, paid dividends of £409.7m in 2022-23, up from £122.3m a year before. Their net profit margins went up from 14.3% to 41.6%. Since the collapse of franchising, train operating companies are now on management contracts of margins of about 2%. Train operators’ contracts are now structured for the government to make up the shortfall between revenue and costs, meaning taxpayers are now effectively paying the £3.1bn spent last year on leasing trains, almost a quarter of total industry costs. “Hell and high water” clauses protect lease contracts on rolling stock despite passenger revenue virtually disappearing in 2020 during the pandemic. According to well-placed sources, the Department for Transport did not attempt to renegotiate or reschedule lease payments to rolling stock companies, despite demanding Network Rail and train operators find huge savings. The three rolling stock companies are Eversholt, Porterbrook and Angel Trains. They were created at privatisation with the controversial sell-off of state-owned British Rail trains, and still lease the majority of UK trains. They have paid cumulative dividends of around £2bn in the last decade, and the highest-paid directors earn almost twice as much as the chief executive of Network Rail, Andrew Haines. According to its latest accounts, filed last year, Eversholt, a subsidiary of Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong firm CK Hutchison, paid dividends of £40.7m in 2022, while its chief executive, Mary Kenny, was paid £1.075m.  Porterbrook, owned by a group of shareholders led by Luxembourg-based insurer Allianz and Canadian pension fund AIM, paid dividends of £80m in 2022, while chief executive Mary Grant was paid £1.2m. Angel Trains, majority-owned by the Canadian pension fund PSP, paid dividends of £124.6m, and chief executive Malcolm Brown was paid £900k. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, said the firms neither built nor commissioned trains but were taking huge profits: “If a traditional company invests, researches, spends its capital, then they’ve got the right to make a return – but the rolling stock leasing companies don’t do that. They are a middle person between essentially now the taxpayer and the manufacturers. “These fancy financial instruments and leasebacks are just another version of PFI, which has been a disaster for our hospitals and local councils. It’s legal, but there is a racket going on, where the structure of rolling stock leasing has just created massive dividends and massive profits entirely without risk.”  Most rail fares in England are due to rise by 4.9% next month. Labour has said that if elected, it will bring train operating companies into public ownership as contracts expire, but it declined to comment on the Roscos. Bringing rolling stock back into public ownership was complicated, Lynch admitted: “But at least Labour could look at a windfall tax on these Roscos to get some of our money back.”  Within parts of the rail industry, there is significant support for Roscos. One senior source said: “They’ve made big bucks, but we’ve got thousands of new trains … If [buying trains] was on the government books, schools, the NHS or police would have got the spending first.” Roger Ford, industry editor of Modern Railways, said competition had improved since the post-privatisation triopoly, while some direct government procurement had proved worse value for money: “The Intercity Express trains which the government procured with a 27-year maintenance contract was much more expensive than leasing – and makes it very difficult to change things.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “By taking on the financial risk, rolling stock companies drive up the quality of our trains while freeing up billions of pounds to be spent on schools, hospitals and roads. Although ultimately for operators, we have spent over a decade working to introduce competition into the market and drive down costs.” A Porterbrook spokesperson said it had invested over £3bn in passenger and freight vehicles in the last 30 years, supporting more than 100 UK companies and 7,000 jobs. “We’re able to invest in groundbreaking innovation for the railway because of the funding that our shareholders provide, and in the normal course of business, when appropriate, dividends are paid. “This funding has allowed Porterbrook to invest over £350m in significant fleet upgrade programmes, £12m in the development of the UK’s first hydrogen-powered train, HydroFLEX, to support net-zero targets, and over £10m upgrading the Long Marston Rail Innovation Centre in Warwickshire to support innovation and maintenance for our customers and the railway”. An Angel Trains spokesperson said the firm had invested more than £1.5bn over a decade and spent most of the money on services from small and medium-sized firms.  “In the last year alone, in excess of £250m was spent on rolling stock. This substantial financial risk is borne by our shareholders and business, not the UK taxpayer, and is crucial to driving change in our rail network.” They said the dividend was the first paid in three years and represented an annual return of 4.1% for shareholders, while every Angel Trains company, including the Jersey-based parent companies, was registered for tax in the UK. Eversholt declined to comment."

        "content": "The Body Shop’s fair trade suppliers who work with vulnerable people from the Amazon to Africa say they have been left with more than $1m worth of beauty ingredients that may now never be ordered or paid for by the ethical beauty chain. The retailer, which called in administrators to its UK arm last week, has partnerships with 18 community fair trade partnerships around the world via its own scheme. Many of the relationships have been in place for more than 20 years. Several told the Guardian they could be left with hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock – a figure that may not be large by corporate standards, but suppliers said it was very meaningful to families living on low incomes in often remote areas. The Body Shop’s UK arm continues to trade as usual, administrators from the accounting firm FRP said, and creditors will be kept informed as the process moves forward. However, any supplier debts will be lined up behind many other creditors – and orders could shrink if the stores are closed. Aurelius, the restructuring specialist that bought Body Shop for £207m in a deal finalised last month, is understood to be the main creditor with a secured debt which will ensure it gets paid. It is expected to take back the chain, but only after many shops have closed.  The future of the group’s Irish, mainland European and Japanese divisions also hangs in the balance. The German business was put into insolvency last week.  Interactive  Several community suppliers told the Guardian they had no written contract with The Body Shop, but had produced an agreed amount of product for the business for many years. Gaston Vizcarra, president of Candela Peru – which has been providing Brazilian nut oil for The Body Shop since 1998 from nuts collected by 400 local families in the Amazon – said there was a $0.5m inventory of oil on hold for the retailer. “We don’t have any debt, but for more than two years we have manufactured this oil ready to go. There is no contract. It is based on trust.   Related: ‘A scented awakening’: how The Body Shop influenced generations   “We usually sell a certain volume but The Body Shop has not been buying for at least a year. It has affected our capacity to work with producers and buy nuts from them.”  Most of the fair trade community projects do not supply The Body Shop directly. They sell their ingredients to intermediaries such as oil refiners or one of the group’s 20-plus cosmetics and beauty product manufacturers. The producers are concerned that if manufacturers are not paid by administrators to The Body Shop, they in turn will not be paid. “It’s a worry,” said the head of one community producer group based in Africa which works of thousands of individuals. “We are all affected, whatever the changes coming up. It is going to affect the whole supply chain.” Mayk Arruda from CoppalJ, a Brazilian cooperative working with local communities that produces oil from the Babassu palm which grows in the Amazon, said it had just received an order for 30 tonnes of oil worth more than €300,000 and was concerned that it may not be paid. “We work with 258 families directly and can impact more than 1,000,” he said. “If we are not paid, we are going to face a big problem. It is very important for us to generate a good quality of life.” He said the higher price paid for the oil by The Body Shop had generated a “revolution in families’ lives” and there was a concern “that we will lose [that].” Nick Hoskyns has supplied The Body Shop with sesame oil from the Juan Francisco Paz Silva cooperative in Nicaragua since 1993. The group works with 270 families. It has about $300,000 of sesame oil in stock that was produced without a contract. “We have a relationship of trust and exclusivity of over 30 years which has been more than a contract. A break in trust has happened with Aurelius. There has been a sort of cultural bucket of water being poured over us. “How can this happen to such an amazing company that has done so much?” Some fair trade suppliers deal directly with The Body Shop and so may miss out on payments as they will be in line behind secured creditors, such as Aurelius, in the UK arm’s administration.  Milan Dev Bhattarai is the founder of Get Paper Industries in Nepal, which has been providing handmade recycled paper packaging to The Body Shop since 1989 via a partnership brokered by The Body Shop’s founder, Anita Roddick. Dev Bhattarai said the company was not owed money but he added: “If there are closures of The Body Shop UK, not only more than 500 producers will have negative impact in their lives, but hundreds of girls will lose the opportunity for education, thousands of children will miss the opportunities for improved school. People of local communities will lose health support and many girls might be trafficked for difficult life. Tree plantation will be disturbed.”"

        "published_date": "2024-02-18T11:56:36+00:00",
        "content": "Britain’s economy is in a deep rut. After news confirming the country fell into recession late last year, most experts agree the downturn is likely to be shortlived and shallow. Few, though, are betting on a strong recovery from the toughest period for living standards in almost 70 years. In most of the economic cycles of the past century, robust growth has typically followed each period of recession, as households and businesses get back on their feet after each setback. But as highlighted by Matt Whittaker of the Pro Bono Economics thinktank, the past two decades have been different. Gross domestic product per capita has either fallen or flatlined for the past seven quarters, and it is now 16 years since the last sustained uptick came to an end. For whoever wins the next general election, making sure Britain can escape this quagmire ought to be the top priority. After more than a decade and a half of flatlining progress, capped by the current cost of living crisis, poverty levels have risen sharply. The proceeds of what little growth has been eked out are unevenly spread and geographically imbalanced, while the UK is slipping behind comparable advanced nations. To revive the sputtering engine of the economy, the next government will, however, need to keep in mind the kind of growth Britain would benefit from most. The plan will need two priorities in particular: tackling the inequalities entrenched over the past decade, and ensuring the biggest challenge of all – the climate crisis – is addressed. So far there is reluctance among political leaders to set out a clear roadmap, with Rishi Sunak promising tax cuts that would fail on the first priority while increasingly hacking away at policies that could help address the second. The prime minister had promised in the first weeks of his premiership to turn Britain into a “clean energy superpower”. Since then, however, Sunak has rowed back on net zero policies and leaned into anti-green politics to pacify the right of his party. Keir Starmer has also staged a managed retreat, having scaled back Labour’s £28bn green investment plan out of fear the Tories could weaponise it in the election campaign. At the heart of both is a common theme: affordability. The fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, Covid pandemic, Brexit and the cumulative drag on productivity from more than a decade of Tory underinvestment has indeed taken its toll on the exchequer, as has spiralling demand from an ageing population. The government’s budget deficit is historically high, while the national debt has risen to the highest level since the 1960s. However, it also plays on two falsehoods. First, that inaction is cost-free. This is patently untrue, as the past 15 years of underinvestment have shown, laying the ground for our current weak economic performance. The consequences of the climate crisis are also becoming clearer and costlier for households and businesses. And second, that leaving the private sector alone to kickstart growth and manage the climate transition would be cheaper. The cost of investing in new technologies does not magically vanish in the private sector. Instead of being borne on the government balance sheet – paid for mostly through taxation – the household balance sheet picks it up instead, in the prices charged for utilities, goods and services. As a paper from the leftwing Common Wealth thinktank last week showed, state-led investment in clean energy could be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent, primarily through the difference in cheaper borrowing costs that nations enjoy over corporate borrowers, helping households to save money on their bills. Investing in the climate transition could also help kickstart economic growth, creating the jobs and industries of the future. The report set out the case for a more ambitious plan for Labour’s Great British Energy, the party’s publicly owned clean energy generation company. According to the report, Labour’s initial £8.3bn capitalisation of GB Energy could save between £125m and £208m a year on debt interest costs each year compared with equivalent borrowing in the private sector – saving up to £1bn in total. While Starmer cut back Labour’s overall £28bn investment plan, the decision to keep and prioritise GB Energy is an important move. Plenty of details over its operation still need clarifying. And it could be more ambitious. But a publicly owned firm investing in renewable energy could help optimise the transition to net zero. One criticism would be that the state lacks the knowhow big energy companies possess, or would be less efficient than the private sector, adding to the cost of energy generation. However, it is increasingly clear the market alone is failing to deliver, as some of the wealthiest energy firms in history funnel profits into investor payouts rather than renewables. Over the last two years energy companies have benefited from a boom in prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing what ought to be a powerful war chest for the green transition. But analysis by the IPPR thinktank shows that BP and Shell alone handed £32.6bn back to their investors in 2022 through dividends and share buybacks – 11 times more than the £2.9bn they invested in renewables. In a world of rising supply chain costs, geopolitical shocks and higher borrowing costs on financial markets, a state-backed firm could help de-risk the cost of renewables projects for private firms by co-investing alongside them. It makes even more sense when the approach is already the norm in Britain – only with companies owned by overseas governments rather than our own. Figures from Common Wealth show 42.2% of the installed capacity from operational and under-construction windfarms in the UK is owned by foreign public entities, including state-owned enterprises and public pension funds. Such is the lack of our own involvement that the UK government owns less of that capacity (0.03%) than the city of Munich does (0.85%) through its stake in the Gwynt y Môr windfarm off the north Wales coast. The next government will have choices to make. Powering up economic growth could be helped by a step-change in green investment. Rather than holding back amid fears over affordability, it’s the cost of inaction that would hurt more."

        "content": "Currys has rejected a takeover bid from the US investment group Elliott, saying the offer significantly undervalued its business. Elliott, which owns the book chain Waterstones and has a controlling stake in the food chain Wasabi, tabled an unsolicited £700m bid for the electrical goods retailer – at 62p a share, a 32% premium to its latest share price. Currys was valued at £533m at the close of trading on the London stock market on Friday. A deal would heighten fears that London’s status as a premier listings market is under threat, with the number of listed companies shrinking by more than 12% during the past three years, according to the Quoted Companies Alliance. A spate of takeovers by US and European private equity firms could continue this year while sterling remains weak. Last year, the Swedish private equity firm EQT bought Yorkshire-based Dechra Pharmaceuticals in a £4.5bn deal, while US-based CVC bought the retailer Ted Baker for £300m. Currys said in a statement: “The board confirms that it received an unsolicited, preliminary and conditional proposal from Elliott regarding a possible cash offer. “[We] considered the proposal, together with [our] financial advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects.” In 2021, Currys shifted its strategy to merge the four brands it operated – which included PC World, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse – into one master brand. In November last year, Currys struck a £175m deal to sell its Greek business. During the pandemic, the retailer closed the 531 Carphone Warehouse stores it owned in the UK, with the loss of 2,900 jobs. ​​ Currys now employs more than 15,000 people in the UK, trading from about 300 stores. In 2018, Currys hired Shop Direct’s Alex Baldock as chief executive after Sebastian James resigned from the role to run Boots. Currys was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1927. News of the takeover bid was first reported by Sky News."

        "content": "Wang Jin felt sure that he could invest in Sichuan Trust, an institution that was part of one of what he describes as the “four pillars” of China’s financial system: banks, securities, insurance and trusts. Promised a return on his investment of 8.3%, he handed over 1.6m yuan (£178,000) in 2019. “The trust had a state licence, so we believed in its integrity,” Wang (not his real name) recalls. Unluckily for him, in May 2020, the company said that it would be unable to repay 20bn yuan of investments. Protests ensued, with hundreds of middle-aged investors gathering outside the headquarters in Chengdu to demand their money back. By the end of the year, the local government had taken over the firm, which was reported to have a shortfall of more than 30bn yuan on its books, although the company said the sum was closer to 25bn. Now, Wang is one of more than 8,000 investors who have been given until 5 March to accept a sliding scale repayment plan that would return 80% of capital to the smallest investors, while those who had invested more than 10m yuan would get back 40%. Investors are furious. The offer is “legalised robbery”, one of them says, in chat messages seen by the Observer. The troubles at Sichuan Trust are a microcosm of the strain spreading through China’s £2.3tn trust industry as an economic downturn, combined with tighter government regulation, risks torpedoing a major part of the “shadow” banking industry that has filled the gaps left by traditional financial institutions.  “Sichuan Trust was one of the earliest to fail,” says Diana Choyleva, chief economist at the consultancy Enodo Economics. “But its issues are broadly representative of issues that face the whole industry because of the rolling crisis in real estate.” The trusts are a uniquely Chinese phenomenon. They are financial institutions that blend banking, wealth management and hedge fund activities, offering investment products to institutions and wealthy individuals. They exist to provide credit to parts of the economy that have traditionally struggled to access financing from traditional banks, such as property and mining. As private sector companies, particularly property developers, boomed in the 00s, trusts became an important part of the economy, providing cash to hungry businesses. They have become a pillar of the non-bank financial system – otherwise known as shadow banking – that has come to account for between 40% and 60% of China’s GDP, although estimates vary wildly. Sichuan Trust has blamed the regulatory squeeze on the sector for its troubles. But analysts had been raising the alarm about practices at the firm for years. Sichuan Trust has “consistently stood out for the past 10 years as being one of the more trouble-prone players in the industry,” says Jason Bedford, an analyst in Singapore who is an expert on China’s trust sector. In 2021, the company was fined 34.9m yuan for making illicit loans and illegally transferring money to shareholders. Considering the firm’s troubles, Bedford says that the level of the proposed restitution is “quite high”, which “suggests either government or other money might be funding those payouts”. Several investors wrote to China’s National Administration of Financial Regulation, demanding to know what assets were ­underlying the trusts’ investments. But in January the authorities refused, ­saying that the information was a “state secret”. Wang says: “It’s normal to take our money and invest it, and if it does lose money, or the investment fails, that’s normal, and we’ll accept that.”  But he and other investors suspect foul play, especially since the former controlling shareholder of the company, Liu Canglong, was detained by police in 2021. Sichuan Trust declined to comment for this article. While Sichuan has not disclosed its holdings, they are likely to include property assets. Trusts have disproportionately helped to finance China’s real estate boom, which since 2008 has been one of the main drivers of its economic growth. That makes them particularly vulnerable to contagion from the current downward spiral in the property market. According to the publicly available financial statements, between 6% and 7% of their lending is to real estate. But Bedford estimates the exposure is more like 30-35%, with lending often disguised under other structures or industries. Since Beijing unleashed a regulatory whirlwind on the property sector in 2020, which was aimed at deleveraging the sector, real estate has been in the doldrums. Although the government has since backpedalled on some of these measures in an effort to boost the market, lending to property developers remains low – not least because developers no longer want cash to build flats that people are not buying. “In the long term, trusts will have to fundamentally change their business model,” says Choyleva. They may shift their financing towards the government’s preferred industries, such as hi-tech manufacturing. But banks are much more willing and able to lend to these companies than they were 20 years ago, reducing the demand for trust products.  “As the potential investment returns in this area are much more uncertain than during the peak years of property growth, the attractiveness of their products to retail investors will also decrease,” says Choyleva. All this is little solace to middle-class investors such as Wang, who increasingly feel that the government has broken the social contract that allowed people to get rich so long as they didn’t get involved in politics. “It’s robbing people’s blood and sweat … it’s the government doing this: it’s shameless,” he says. There is a sense that China’s leaders, who are becoming less keen on bailouts, in case they sustain economic bubbles, are not sympathetic to well-to-do people such as Wang.  Trust investors normally need a minimum of about 1m yuan in cash to get started. The firms promise higher interest rates than traditional banks in exchange for higher levels of risk. But their practices are opaque and there is widespread concern that investors are not made fully aware of the risks of their investments. Bedford recalls the boss of a major trust company saying: “Banks do whatever they are explicitly permitted to do. Trust companies do anything, so long as they are not explicitly not permitted to do so.” In 2018, China’s regulators introduced a host of reforms to try to get a grip on the shadow banking sector, including banning financial institutions from offering guaranteed returns on investments. In recent years it has also allowed an increasing number of trust firms to default; in January, Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, a shadow banking institution with up to £50bn in debts, filed for bankruptcy.  “What is happening is kind of in line with what the government has been striving for, for a very long period of time,” says Dinny McMahon, the head of China markets research at Trivium, a consulting firm – to establish the principle that an investor “should go in with their eyes open”. But even as trusts run into crises, wealthy Chinese people who cannot move their money out of the country have few places to invest their cash. During China’s boom years, the rich put money into property, the stock market or wealth management products. All three of those industries are crashing. This reflects a wider shift in China’s economic policymaking, with Beijing increasingly reluctant either to save failing companies or to inject the massive stimulus that economists say is needed to reboot the flagging economy. Some analysts even believe that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, no longer sees the economy as the ultimate indicator of his success.  In 2018, Daniel Rosen and Logan Wright, researchers at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, wrote that “periods of financial stress with the potential for crisis have been relatively short-lived” because of the belief that the government would “step in to resolve any financial instability”. But that belief is starting to fade. Additional research by Tau Yang"

        "content": "As a longstanding observer of the British economy, I sympathise with the general reader trying to make sense of recent reports on what is happening to it. One week he or she is told that inflation is falling; another week that it isn’t. One week we are reliably informed that interest rates are going to be reduced; the next that they are not. One week there is no danger of falling into recession. The next week we are informed that we are already in one. Perhaps the most perplexing of all has been the reporting in recent months of the prospects for the imminent budget on 6 March. Yes, there is going to be a tax-cutting bonanza on the lines of the historic Nigel Lawson budget of 1988 (which happened to end in tears, with one of the biggest recessions since the 1930s). But hang on a minute. While the ink is still drying on those reports, we are reminded that – with memories still fresh about the disastrous market reaction to the Truss-Kwarteng mini-budget – Chancellor Hunt is going to be fiscally responsible, keep to strict fiscal rules, and ignore the extreme right’s calls for an “election-winning, tax-cutting” budget after all. But hang on another minute, or another week. Despite the way that the Labour party is tying itself in knots over its choice of candidates, the Tories carry on polling badly, and “something must be done”. That something turns out to be a leak to the Financial Times that there is, after all, a plan for a tax-cutting budget, but that it will be “fiscally responsible”, with tax cuts counterbalanced by reductions in public spending.   Labour is terrified above all of being accused, as it was in 1992, of planning a ‘tax bombshell’   Now, the Conservative party is in a fissiparous state. It is furlongs behind in the general election stakes, and is as unpopular as a British governing party could possibly be. Yet the Labour opposition is like a rabbit cowering in the headlights, terrified of committing itself to the Attlee-style economic reconstruction programme it is patently obvious the country needs, let alone to a complete overhaul of the welfare state – very much including the National Health Service – which was once Labour’s pride and joy. It is terrified above all of being accused, as Labour was in 1992, of planning a “tax bombshell”. So it finds itself too nervous to say that it would reverse the Tory tax cuts, let alone come clean with the electorate and admit that, with many public services in desperate trouble, a financial rescue operation requires Scandinavian levels of taxation. But that is not the end of it. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, we and other nations enjoyed a “peace dividend”, when defence spending could safely be reduced, affording room for domestic needs. President Putin and Donald Trump have put a stop to that, and if Labour is indeed elected, it is going to have to increase the defence budget substantially. What Labour should not be frightened of is long-term borrowing to finance the many investment projects – green or any other colour – that it knows are needed to revive the stagnant economy it will probably inherit. In the end, such investment should pay dividends. Of course, life for a Labour government, and for the rest of us, would be brighter if Keir Starmer recognised that he was right about Brexit and that we should return to the EU single market and customs union as soon as possible. After the Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimate of a Brexit blow to the nation’s output of 4% of GDP, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research putting that figure at up to 6%, we now have Goldman Sachs telling us that output is already running 5% lower – with all that that connotes in lost tax revenues – than it would be if it were not for the folly of Brexit. JK Galbraith once observed, in a very different context: “In Goldman Sachs we trust.” That was an ironical reference to the investment bank’s contribution to the debacle described so eloquently in Galbraith’s definitive work, The Great Crash, 1929. However, I am struck by the judgment of James Moberly and Sven Jari Stehn in Goldman’s report The Structural and Cyclical Costs of Brexit that “UK goods trade has underperformed other advanced economies by around 15% since the referendum” and that “business investment has been weak since 2016, falling noticeably short of the pre-referendum trend”. This fits with one’s general impression from other analyses. What a shambles it all is. Let us hope that the Labour leaders, buoyed by their sensational victories in last week’s byelections, conduct yet another policy U-turn, this time on their attitude towards rejoining the customs union and single market!"

        "content": "Working from home allows people to eat more healthily, feel less stressed and have lower blood pressure, according to a large-scale review of academic literature on post-pandemic workplaces. Yet remote workers are also more likely to eat snacks, drink more, smoke more and put on weight, the study found. And employers who believe that people working from home are lazy should think again – they are less likely to take time off sick, tend to work longer hours and to work evenings and weekends. The review, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response – a partnership between the UK Health Security Agency, King’s College London, and the University of East Anglia – considered 1,930 academic papers on home working, teleworking and other types of hybrid and home working in an effort to distil the often contradictory research.   Related: From beating burglary to weight gain: 12 ways that working from home has changed Britain   Prof Neil Greenberg, a psychiatrist at King’s College London and one of the study’s authors, said the study showed that workers and employers needed to start considering home working with the same seriousness as they did office working. “In the old days of office working, people realised that if you put everyone in the same room with no sound-proofing, it was all unpleasant and you didn’t have a very productive workforce,” he said. “Now that we’ve shifted to a home working culture, it makes sense for organisations and the government to make sure that people who are home working are doing it in as effective a way as possible.” The review, published in the Journal of Occupational Health, identified three themes – the working environment at home, the effect on workers’ lives and careers, and the effect on their health. Greenberg said the research showed that there were winners and losers in many areas of home working. The working environment depended on how much space there was at home, the available equipment and on how much control workers had over their day. People on higher incomes often enjoyed home working more, but those with more responsibilities at home such as childcare or housework – often women and those living alone – tended to be more stressed. “Overall, people felt more productive at home,” Greenberg said. “It was particularly good for creative things, but much more difficult dealing with tedious matters. A lot of people worried about career prospects – this feeling that if you’re not present in the office, you’re going to get overlooked.” Effects on health were clearer. The transition to home working during Covid was linked “with an increase in intake of vegetables, fruit, dairy, snacks, and self-made meals; younger workers and females benefited the most in terms of healthier eating,” the paper said. One of the studies reviewed found that 46.9% of employees working from home had gained weight, and another put the figure at 41%. Most of the papers reviewed showed that homeworkers were more sedentary. Greenberg said: “Managers needed to think about finding ways to support their homeworkers and help create their working environment. “There’s a great adage in science that at some point, we need to stop admiring the problem and actually think about solutions,” he said. “We know quite a lot now. So we need to ask ‘what is the best training for an individual who’s going to become a partial homeworker?’ What we don’t need to do is to ask ‘would it be helpful to train someone to homework?’ The answer is clearly yes.” Since the end of Covid restrictions in 2022, some companies have insisted that employees return to the office full-time, with firms such as JP Morgan requiring managers to be in five days a week. “If companies like JP Morgan are afraid that people at home will be slacking, or won’t be doing a good job, and they can’t keep an eye on them, then I think that is an outdated concept,” Greenberg said. Refusing WFH options will mean that talented employees may find other jobs, and makes companies less flexible in the event of future crises, such as another health emergency or strikes or severe weather conditions that prevent people from reaching their offices, he added. “If they are doing it merely out of fear, then they risk being left behind,” he said. “We looked at a huge amount of evidence of the years and what our review shows is that there are ways to make the home working approach actually work well for the organisation and also for the employee.” • This article was amended on 19 February. An earlier version said that the review was carried out by researchers at the UK Health Security Agency and King’s College London. In fact, it was funded and carried out by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response – a partnership between the UK Health Security Agency, King’s College London, and the University of East Anglia."

        "content": "Britain has a sick economy and it is getting sicker. The clear message from last week’s raft of economic data is that the UK is being held back by the growing number of people not able to work because of long-term illness. There are many theories about why the trend is worsening. Possible factors include long Covid, delays in NHS treatment as waiting lists grow longer, poor workplace practices, stress and the impact of austerity. But one thing is certain. The economic impact of ill health is a headache for Jeremy Hunt. It will be a headache for Rachel Reeves if she becomes the first female chancellor. It is a headache for every business that is struggling to fill vacancies. Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics illustrated the extent of the problem. The number of people saying they are inactive due to long-term sickness is now 2.8 million – an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year and of 700,000 since the pandemic started in 2020. This matters, and not just for those who would be working if their circumstances were different. This high level of long-term illness helps explain why the UK’s workforce is 700,000 smaller than its pre-Covid level, why the labour market is so tight and why the economy is flatlining. Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses are growing increasingly concerned about higher levels of inactivity and its economic impact. It is impacting on growth and inflation. Wages are rising because of skills shortages. This has an effect on both employers and individuals.” This is not a new issue. Large numbers of employees were invalided out of the workforce when factories and coalmines were closed in the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. This century, Britain has had a higher percentage of people inactive due to ill health than Germany, France or Italy. But two new factors – Covid and longer NHS waiting lists – have made matters significantly worse in recent years. Yet what’s especially worrying for economic policymakers is that Britain has gone from being the G7 country with the lowest levels of inactivity to the one where, uniquely, the workforce has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility has pointed out: “The available international evidence suggests that while the UK has consistently been a strong performer internationally in terms of working-age participation, its post-pandemic rise in inactivity stands out. And ill health has consistently been a bigger factor behind inactivity in the UK than in most other advanced economies, with post-pandemic trends likely to have amplified these differences.” While it would be tempting to dub Britain the sick man of Europe, it would not be strictly accurate. Feminist thinktank the Women’s Budget Group (WBG) has pointed out that there are 200,000 more women than men inactive due to ill health (1.5 million against 1.3 million). The WBG says this is not just down to Covid, but continues a trend that was evident before the pandemic. Zubaida Haque, the WBG’s deputy director, said women were more likely to be in low-paid jobs and suffering the impact of austerity. “This has not been happening in a vacuum. Women were hit disproportionately by the pandemic but they were also more severely impacted by the benefit cuts made between 2010 and 2020. It is no good the government trying to deal with the symptoms of the problem.” Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the 2.8 million people inactive due to long-term sickness were a real concern: “This is holding back the economy, putting pressure on the public finances and the NHS, and limiting opportunities for too many people. Reversing this trend will be a priority for the current and next government.” According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the government is already on the case. A spokesperson said: “With an extra 4 million people in work since 2010, we are now going even further, with welfare reforms forecast to reduce the number of people who would otherwise have been placed in the highest tier of incapacity benefits by over 370,000.   Heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to deliver proactive policies. Human lives and economic prosperity depend on it  Chris Thomas, IPPR    “Our back to work plan will help over a million people, including those with disabilities and long-term health conditions, to start and stay in work, as we continue to bring down inflation, cut taxes and grow the economy.” One option for the government would be to try to fill the hundreds of thousands of job vacancies by tightening welfare conditions. But experts such as Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation thinktank, have warned that forcing people into work through punitive benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and might lead to more ill health. Whichever approach it decides to take, the government is under pressure to do more, both in terms of preventing illness, and in tailoring back-to-work programmes for those who take time off sick, ensuring that they don’t exit the labour market altogether. While it is inactivity due to ill health that has grabbed the headlines recently, plenty of people with health problems are working, and are more likely to carry on if they get appropriate support. A study by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found people were more likely to leave work because of a heart condition than for any other health problem. The IPPR said someone suffering the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2021-22 had a 22% likelihood of leaving their job, compared with 14% for those with a mental health problem and 16% for those diagnosed with cancer. Chris Thomas, head of the IPPR’s commission on health and prosperity, said: “After great strides in tackling cardiovascular disease in the 20th century, the UK is now stalling, if not reversing. This is costing not just lives, but also livelihoods. The good news is that heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to get on to the front foot and deliver proactive policies. Both human lives and economic prosperity depend on it.” Gratton at the BCC said firms could help by allowing flexible working, investing more in occupational health and offering staff medical insurance. Jon Boys, senior research economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the reduction in workers was compounding labour supply difficulties and limiting growth. There was ample evidence of both in last week’s economic data, with the ONS reporting more than 900,000 job vacancies and unemployment below 4%, at a time when the UK economy was in recession. Boys said breaking down barriers to working for people with health problems should be a priority for policymakers and employers. Like Gratton, he said it was vital to focus on occupational health, to prevent individuals from exiting the workforce prematurely: “It is all very well getting people back into work but the bigger issue is not allowing them to fall out of it in the first place.” Boys said both government and employers needed to address inactivity: employers through an awareness of the impact of stress in the workplace and addressing heavy and unsustainable workloads, and ministers by tackling NHS waiting lists. “The government has to recognise that health policy is economic policy,” Boys said. “They can’t be treated in silos.”"

        "content": "Barclays chief executive CS Venkat­akrishnan has a tough act to follow. Just days after rival NatWest revealed its biggest profit since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the Barclays boss will be delivering much less cheering news: cost cuts, job losses and restructuring plans are all expected to feature in the bank’s first major strategy update in a decade. Tuesday’s results will also be a lesson in salesmanship: how to promise better times after reporting yet another slip in annual profits. Analysts are expecting the chief executive – who is known to colleagues as “Venkat” – to reveal a 4.5% fall in pre-tax profits, to £6.7bn. Although UK lenders have benefited from higher charges on loans and mortgages – thanks to the fastest rise in interest rates since the 1970s – at Barclays those earnings will partly be offset by restructuring costs, which are expected to result in a charge of between £700m and £1bn. Figures from Barclays’s investment bank is also likely to be a drag on profits, following another sluggish year for deals and public listings. The downturn has already taken a toll on US rivals such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both of which reported their lowest annual profit in four years in January. But that division’s poor performance could serve to show Venkat is on the right track. He wants to scale down the volatile investment bank side, and lean more heavily on income from wealth management and retail banking (this paved the way for Barclays’s £700m buyout of Tesco’s banking business this month). The rub here is that he is asking shareholders to join him on what is in effect a U-turn. Venkat’s predecessor Jes Staley, now mired in controversy, spent years resisting pressure from an activist investor who also wanted to see a much smaller, if not entirely offloaded, investment bank. “Barclays fought off calls from Edward Bramson of Sherborne Investors to spin off the unit, and rebutted suggestions that it did not earn a consistently high enough return on equity to justify the amount of group capital allocated to it,” said analysts at AJ Bell. “A bumper first quarter in 2023 helped to support Barclays’s strategy but the investment bank’s performance has ebbed since.” The questions now are about the scale and costs of the restructuring plans. Though the costs could eat into bankers’ bonus pools, they are unlikely to have a large impact on dividends. Venkat is expected to soften the blow of another drop in profits with a dividend payout that AJ Bell expects could reach 9.5p a share, up from 7.25p in 2022. At the very least, it will help distract from more controversial matters, including a recent report by Bloomberg which alleges that Staley stayed in touch with Jeffrey Epstein for years after taking over as Barclays chief executive – despite claims that he cut ties with the convicted sex offender in 2015. The former Barclays boss is challenging the Financial Conduct Authority, after it ruled that he had misled the regulator over his relationship with the disgraced financier. The FCA has since banned Staley from holding any senior role in the City. Neither Staley nor Barclays have commented on the report. UK bank announcements will continue on Wednesday, with analysts expecting HSBC to double its annual pre-tax profits, to $34bn (£27bn) from $17.5bn in 2022. The London-headquartered lender will have benefited from rising interest rates in Asia – where it makes the bulk of its profits – and the west. This is likely to result in another significant payout for chief executive Noel Quinn, who was handed a $5.5m package in 2022, including a $2.2m bonus.   Lloyds will be watched closely for signs of mortgage market wobbles as customers’ fixed rate loans come to an end   The earnings surge will also provide some comfort for investors worried about the impact of China’s property downturn, which led to the forced liquidation of developer Evergrande last month. “Operationally, there are some concerns investors would like reassurance on,” said Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “HSBC’s exposure to the wavering Chinese real estate sector brings added risk that further impairment charges will be needed.” Lloyds Banking Group will also publish its annual results on Wednesday, with 2023 profits expected to rise more than 7%, to £7.4bn. The group, which is the country’s biggest mortgage lender and owns the Halifax brand, will be watched closely for any signs of wobbles in the mortgage market, as millions of customers start to roll off fixed-rate loans and face higher monthly payments. However, average analyst estimates suggest the money put aside for potential defaults will drop by 35%, to £975m, which could signal optimism about the UK’s economic growth over the coming months. But some more disappointing news could emerge from its car loans division, after the FCA announced an investigation into unfair charges that some industry experts say could end up costing Lloyds up to £1.8bn."

        "content": "The government’s top levelling-up adviser has warned ministers that failure to tackle the funding crisis for councils across England is threatening one of the Conservatives’ flagship 2019 election promises. Andy Haldane, the chair of the government’s levelling-up advisory council, said a “root and branch rethink” of local authority funding was urgently required to prevent a fresh round of ever-deeper cuts to local services. Blaming austerity as the “root cause” behind growing numbers of council bankruptcies, he told the Guardian: “The surprising thing about this is that any of us are surprised – given the extent of the paring back over the past 15 years in local government funding, on to which you layer a dose of cost increases and inflation across the piece.” The former Bank of England chief economist, who was hired by Boris Johnson to mastermind the government’s levelling-up plans, said the crisis in town hall funding was forcing councils to slash the types of activities that could help power-up economic growth. “What gets cut is often the investment needed to grow out of a hole. So the hole kind of gets ever deeper, as you haven’t got the resources to invest to grow the local economy tomorrow,” he said. “Is this affecting levelling up? Yes, without question.” Increasing numbers of councils in England are warning they in effect face bankruptcy. Despite ministers taking evasive action with an extra £600m to top up funding plans for next year, MPs and council leaders from across the political divide say local authorities are still £4bn short in an “out of control” financial crisis. It comes amid a sharp rise in costs and growing demand on services, made worse by austerity-driven cuts and local missteps. Among the biggest casualties so far are Birmingham and Nottingham, as well as Woking in Surrey and Thurrock in Essex. A recent Guardian investigation revealed most authorities are planning to increase council tax bills by £2bn from April, slash “non-core” services and jobs, and sell off land, buildings and other assets in an attempt to balance their budgets. Ministers have sought to blame councils for their own financial woes, highlighting poor local decision-making and debt-laden authorities where councillors ploughed money into failed commercial investments. However, Haldane said he did not accept the argument, saying swingeing cuts to government funding had left those authorities “forced of necessity to gamble for resurrection”. A key architect of the government’s 12 levelling-up “missions” launched two years ago, he said limited progress had been made on the agenda as it had slipped down the list of Rishi Sunak’s priorities. He praised action on devolution, including plans for new mayoral authorities in the north-east of England and Yorkshire, but said a scorecard on levelling-up progress would be mixed at best. “There are some things where it’s going better than people appreciate. The standout one on that would be devolution,” he said. “The downside of having slipped out of the political spotlight is there might be fewer monies available to help finance this, and that’s a risk many local authorities are facing right now.” The economist, who is the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank, predicted the financial pressure councils were under would likely result in deep cuts to arts, culture and recreation funding in particular. However, he said these types of activities were key to boosting towns and cities outside London and the south-east of England, arguing that green spaces, libraries, galleries, high streets and football clubs were among the local assets that would attract people to live and work in an area. “They are somehow seen as being the hundreds and thousands, or the icing on the cake. But we know they absolutely are the cake. We know in the most deprived parts of the UK, what matters most are those things,” he said. “But we’re still underinvesting in them. We invest diddly squat in what might be called social infrastructure relative to what we invest in physical or digital infrastructure, and it’s always the first casualty of cuts by local government.” A government spokesperson said it was “dedicated to levelling up” and had committed £13bn to support projects. It also said it recognised councils were facing challenges and had provided £600m more for English local authorities for the upcoming financial year. “This additional funding has been welcomed by leading local government organisations – but we remain ready to talk to any concerned council about its financial position,” the spokesperson said."

        "content": "The Body Shop’s mainland European businesses have begun shutting down, with the German stores put into administration and its Belgian staff told they will be next, placing more than 460 jobs at risk across the two countries. The closures come after Aurelius, the German restructuring specialist that bought The Body Shop last year, put the ethical beauty chain’s main UK business into administration this week. Most of the European operations were sold last month to a buyer whose identity was not initially disclosed by Aurelius. Staff were told the buyer was a “family office” – a term that typically refers to the management of personal wealth.   Related: ‘A scented awakening’: how The Body Shop influenced generations   It is understood the buyer is Alma24, a company controlled by Friedrich Trautwein, an executive who has close links to Aurelius. Alma24 is also understood to have taken control of The Body Shop in Japan and Ireland. Staff said they had been told that all 60-plus stores and the head office in Germany, where the business employs almost 400 people, were likely to close. An insolvency specialist, Dr Biner Bähr at the law firm White & Case, has been appointed to handle the German business. Workers in Belgium, where the chain has about 16 stores and 50 employees, are also understood to have been told on Friday morning that administrators were to be appointed. One source said: “The actions being taken may not be wrong but it is how it is being done that is breaking people’s hearts. People are being told with no notice: ‘You work for an unnamed family company,’ when some of these people have been with the company for years, some 30 years. It is so painful.” Sources said The Body Shop’s operations in Ireland, Austria and Luxembourg, which together have about 20 stores and more than 100 staff, were also expected to be put into administration shortly. The Austrian and French websites were not operating on Friday. The problems at The Body Shop’s international divisions mark the latest blow to the group, which has had three owners since it was sold by its founder, Anita Roddick, shortly before her death in 2006. Roddick, who set up the business in Brighton in 1976 to help support her two daughters, campaigned against animal testing of cosmetics and promoted natural products sourced ethically in a way that would support vulnerable communities around the world. She shocked fans of the brand by selling up to L’Oréal, the cosmetics giant that owns Maybelline and Garnier, for £652m. The brand was then sold on to the Brazilian natural cosmetics group Natura, which already owned Australia’s Aesop beauty brand, for €1bn in 2017. After Natura built up debts in buying the Avon home-selling cosmetics group, it quickly sold off Aesop and then The Body Shop. Aurelius agreed to pay £207m for The Body Shop in November last year and took control in January. It only paid £117m upfront, with a further £90m “earn-out” that would only be paid if The Body Shop reached certain financial goals. With large parts of the business now sold off and expected to close, it is not clear if those goals will be reached. It is understood that the status of a number of countries, including France, Spain and Sweden, is unclear as the directors in those countries have not signed documents finalising transfer of ownership. The group’s operations in Canada and Australia, which have been successful, are expected to remain open. One well-placed source said: “We don’t understand today who is the owner and who is responsible for people.” Aurelius is the main creditor to the UK arm of The Body Shop and so is expected to buy back a downsized version of the business – with as few as 100 stores – from administrators. Shortly after buying the business, Aurelius made loans to the group that were secured against intellectual property assets and shares in its Canadian arm, as first reported by the Financial Times. This arrangement effectively gives the group control over key assets, making rival bids unlikely. Alma24 and Aurelius have been contacted for comment."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-16T16:00:45+00:00",
        "content": "In early 2008, inside the Seashell fish and chip shop in Marylebone, west London, Anthony Thomson was about to make a deal. Sitting with the American billionaire Vernon Hill over cod and chips, he revealed plans to import the tycoon’s template for a US-style, consumer-focused bank to the UK. Hill gave Thomson his blessing, and ultimately, a chunk of his money, joining him as co-founder. “He said, ‘Do you want to partner? I’ve got the model. I’ve got the money,’” Thomson recalled. By 2010, the pair had launched Metro Bank: the UK’s first new high street bank in more than a century. Its branch network – known for extravagant launch parties, seven-day openings, and dog-friendly branches – attracted millions of customers and optimistic investors, who helped push its market value to a peak of £3.5bn by 2018. But the party did not last. Not only did Metro fail to capitalise on the digital banking boom – causing tensions that led to Thomson’s exit – but it faced an accounting error that put it on the wrong side of UK regulators. The saga wiped out its share price, led to Hill’s resignation as chair, and dashed hopes for more lenient capital rules that could help it compete with larger rivals. Its failure to regain regulators’ trust pushed it into the arms of another billionaire – the Colombian businessman Jaime Gilinski Bacal – who is helping steer a turnaround plan, with further details expected alongside annual results on 13 March. “I’m still very proud of what we created,” Thomson said. “When I’m in London and I walk past a Metro Bank, I still feel really good about it – and very sorry, very sad, to see what it’s come to.” Metro Bank’s story, however, was touched by controversy from the start. In the dull but dependable world of retail banking, it is a 14-year rollercoaster of ups and downs that may surprise passersby peering through the window of one of its cavernous blue-and-red-themed branches. Hill’s decision to launch a bank outside US borders was not the result of pure ambition. In summer 2007, the flamboyant businessman – who often carried around his yorkshire terrier, Sir Duffy, and went golfing with Donald Trump – was ousted as the boss of Commerce Bank: the Metro Bank precursor he founded 34 years earlier. US federal regulators were concerned over property deals with Hill and his family, as well as multimillion-dollar design contracts with InterArch. InterArch was notably owned by Hill’s wife, Shirley Hill, who lived with her husband in a 45,000-sq ft mansion near Philadelphia that nearly rivalled theWhite House in size. But Hill, who City analysts have described as stubborn, arrogant and abrasive, was not deterred. Plans to import the Commerce Bank model – “lock stock and barrel”, in Thomson’s words – to the UK, meant Hill paid a further £21m to his wife between 2010 and 2018 to design Metro Bank’s trademark branches, replete with imported Italian marble and Canadian wood. While Thomson says Metro could not have succeeded without Shirley’s help, it led shareholder proxies and UK fund managers to say it amounted to a conflict of interest and warranted a vote against Hill’s re-election, which he ultimately survived. However, Ed Firth, a bank analyst at KBW, says the debacle was ultimately “immaterial”, particularly in light of problems to come. Despite the emergence of digital rivals including Monzo, Starling, Revolut, and Thomson’s new venture, Atom Bank, Metro made a £1.6bn stock market debut to much fanfare in 2016. The share price doubled within two years, reaching a valuation of £3.5bn by March 2018, shortly after declaring its first annual profit. Backed by high-profile investors including the British billionaires the Reuben brothers, and US hedge fund manager Steven Cohen, Hill went on a spending spree. Within months he had shelled out £523m for a buy-to-let mortgage book from the US private-equity outfit Cerberus and tapped shareholders for £300m to fund rapid expansion plans. But in January 2019, everything changed. Metro experienced the biggest single-day collapse in a UK bank’s share price since 2008, after it revealed the devastating accounting mistake. It had miscalculated the proportion of risky loans on its balance sheet, meaning Metro breached Bank of England rules that required banks to hold enough capital to cover potential losses. “Ultimately, that was the beginning of everything – the beginning of the end,” Firth said. “If you don’t trust the bank accounts, it’s a disaster … Second, if the regulator doesn’t have trust in the accounts, your problem is magnified by 10. And the third problem is: you just don’t have enough capital any more, which, for a business reliant on growth, is catastrophic.” The misstep prompted an investigation by UK regulators, which fined the bank, while bosses struggled to quell panic. The incident spooked business customers, who pulled £235m in deposits, and rumours over its financial footing had sparked fears of a bank run, as account holders queued to withdraw cash and empty safety deposit boxes. Hill was forced to go cap-in-hand to investors in May to raise more capital. It delivered £375m, and announced a big investor: Bacal, who would later install his daughter, Dorita, on the board. But big investors, including Cohen, were soon selling their stakes, and by September, Metro was forced to pull the plug on a poorly subscribed bond sale that signalled an embarrassing snub by investors. Three months later, Hill and his chief executive, Craig Donaldson, were out the door, as the remaining investors were left nursing a 90% plunge in Metro shares in 2019. Hill returned to his sprawling Philadelphia villa, and by the time the lender announced a £130m annual loss the following February, Metro’s new bosses were declaring plans to cut costs and significantly scale back their expansion. The US private-equity firm Carlyle circled the company, but Metro’s new boss, Dan Frumkin, saw off takeover talks and charged ahead with turnaround plans. Frumkin – best known for helping restructure Northern Rock after the 2007-08 financial crisis – was holding out all hope that regulators would loosen Metro’s capital rules, despite the 2019 accounting debacle. By allowing Metro to use its own internal models to assess risks, he argued, the lender would be better equipped to compete with rivals such as Barclays, NatWest and HSBC. But the Bank of England rejected its request in September 2023, scuppering Metro’s plans and leaving it in need of a fresh pot of cash if it hoped to continue with any meaningful growth. Panic over whether it could find anyone willing to take yet another punt led to a week-long crisis in October. Customers again started to pull cash, private-equity firms circled, and the Bank of England prepared for the worst, sounding out major lenders including NatWest and JP Morgan over whether they would consider an emergency takeover. A potential break-up and wind-down was also on the table. Amid the panic, Metro’s Colombian investor – who built a name for himself flipping the assets of struggling lenders in Latin America – saw an opportunity. After weekend crunch talks, Metro clinched a last-minute deal that led to Bacal scooping up a 53% controlling stake for just £100m, providing cornerstone investment for a larger £925m rescue package. Bacal’s rescue came with conditions, including a leadership cleanout and his own appointment to the board. With his daughter already installed, and the option to appoint another person to the potentially nine-member board, Bacal’s influence appeared destined to grow. And his turnaround plans are already under way. Tied to property leases for its expensive high street branches, it is cutting costs by slashing 800 of its 4,000 staff, reviewing its seven-days-a-week branch model and ploughing more cash into automation. But Firth – one of the few remaining analysts covering Metro now that only 47% of the shares are trading on the open market – warns there may come a point where Bacal makes decisions that are not necessarily in the best interests of other investors. “That’s why, as a minority shareholder, I think you have to reflect on that before buying the stock in the open market. But we’ve had personalities dominating banks across Europe for many years,” he said. “And at least he put the money in,” Firth added. “Maybe if Fred Goodwin put his own money towards 50% of Royal Bank of Scotland, he might have been a little bit more careful with some of his lending.” Metro said: “Banking is fundamentally a people business, and over the years Metro Bank has proved there is a place for a targeted branch model that combines stores and digital channels with exceptional customer service. “The capital package secured in October last year will allow Metro Bank to accelerate its growth plans and deliver sustainable profitable returns as we strive to be the No 1 community bank with customer service at the heart of everything we do.”"

        "content": "  3.11pm GMT  Closing post  Time to wrap up after a busy week, in which UK wage growth slowed, inflation remained steady, and the economy fell into recession. Here’s today main stories so far:   Related: Retail sales in Great Britain rebound strongly after Christmas slump     Related: NatWest reports biggest annual profit since 2007 financial crisis     Related: LNER simpler fares trial adds more than £100 to some train journeys     Related: The Body Shop’s German arm falls into administration     Related: Construction of affordable homes in London is grinding to a halt, Gove told     Related: EDF takes €12.9bn hit after Hinkley Point C delays and cost overruns     Related: Power struggle: fears for UK energy generation as green projects delayed       3.08pm GMT   US consumer confidence has inched a little higher this month. The University of Michigan’s consumer morale index of consumer sentiment has risen to 79.6, up from 79.0, lifted by a rise in consumer expectations. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu explains:  Consumer sentiment was essentially unchanged from January, rising 0.6 index points this month and solidifying the large gains from the past two months. The fact that sentiment lost no ground this month suggests that consumers continue to feel more assured about the economy, confirming the considerable improvements in December and January across various aspects of the economy. Consumers continued to express confidence that the slowdown in inflation and strength in labor markets would continue.  Five-year expectations for business conditions rose 5% to its highest reading since December 2020. Sentiment is currently about 30% above November 2023 and about 6% below its historical average since monthly data collection began in 1978.      2.58pm GMT   Goldman Sachs has cut its forecast for European gas prices this year, citing persistently mild weather. In a new research note, Goldman warn that Europe has not yet solved its energy crisis – it will take one more winter until the risk of extreme gas prices re-emerging has ebbed. But while increased LNG supply has not yet fully making up for lost Russian imports, that will change from 2025, Goldman says, tilting the markest into oversupply.     2.37pm GMT   The jump in US wholesale inflation last month shows that cooling the pace of prices rises all the way down to target is tricky for central bankers. Ken Tjonasam, portfolio strategist at fund management firm Global X ,says:  This PPI print further highlights that getting inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target isn’t just a walk in the park; it’s the last mile that’s the toughest.  For Chair Powell and the Fed, this means recalibrating their lens on the economic landscape. The narrative of easing into a rate cut has just hit a snag.”       2.20pm GMT   The drop in the pound following the hotter-than-expected US PPI data is helping to support stocks in London. The FTSE 100 index is having a fine day, up 110 points or 1.45% at 7707 points. Mining stocks, and Asis-focused financial services group Prudential, are among the top risers, reflecting hopes that China might take fresh measure to support its economy.     1.40pm GMT  US producer price inflation hotter than forecast  Just in: US producers raised their prices at a faster rate than forecast last month, dampening hopes that inflationary pressures were ebbing. Producer prices rose by 0.3% in January, following a 0.1% drop in the PPI index in December. This was driven by a 0.6% rise in prices for services, while goods prices fell 0.2%. On an annual basis, prices were 0.9% higher than a year ago, higher than the 0.6% expected but a little lower than December’s 1%. Worryingly, core PPI inflation (stripping out foods, energy, and trade services) increased by 2.6% year-on-year.

Mohammed Zina, 35, was found guilty by a London jury yesterday. He had used information obtained at Goldman Sachs to trade in stocks including semiconductor designer Arm, ahead of its takeover by SoftBank, and pub company Punch Taverns. Zina had been employed by Goldman Sachs International in its conflicts resolution group in London. At Southwark Crown Court, Judge Tony Baumgartner told Zina he had thrown away a promising banking career, saying:  “You betrayed the trust of your employer, as well as cheated honest investors in the shares you traded using inside information you saw at work. “What you did strikes at the very heart of our financial markets and the trust and confidence the public places in them.”  A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said:  “Mohammed Zina betrayed the trust we placed in him and his misuse of client information was in direct contradiction of our values. We have zero tolerance for this conduct.”  Zina had made a profit of about £140,000 from the insider trading, financed with loans obtained from Tesco Bank that were meant for home improvements.  Updated at 2.21pm GMT    12.07pm GMT   As has become traditional, the latest UK retail sales figures show the impact of inflation. While sales volumes rose by 3.4% in January, shoppers actually spent 3.9% more than in December – meaning they spent more for less.     11.24am GMT   In the City, shares in NatWest have jumped by over 6% this morning after the bank reported a 20% jump in profits for last year. They have hit 229.7p, the highest since last October. Fran Boait, co-executive director at campaign group Positive Money, argues that the popularity of NatWest’s shares today shows the government shouldn’t be looking to sell the taxpayer’s stake. Boait says:  “NatWest represents an enormous missed opportunity by this government. “Continuing to sell off the public’s shares for a huge loss when the bank is finally posting stronger results perfectly illustrates the short-termism that has come to define our government. “The government could also have used its majority stake to ensure NatWest passes higher interest rates onto depositors, which would’ve pressured other banks to do the same.”  The government acquired its NatWest shares at a price of 500p each, when it bailed out then-Royal Bank of Scotland after the financial crisis. NatWest’s shares have not traded over 500p since 2010, so the chances of the public making a profit anytime soon seems very thin…. …Especially as the bank has forecast a drop in earnings this year (see 7.38am), with falling interest rates expected to hit profitability.  Updated at 12.02pm GMT    10.59am GMT  Energy price cap predicted to fall 15% in April  The cap on UK energy bills is set to fall by 15% when it is next set, analysts at Cornwall Insight say. Cornwall estimates that the price cap will drop to £1,635 per annum, for a typical household, in April.  This is a fall of 15% (£293) from the current price cap which was set at £1,928 per year from January, and should bring some relief to households struggling to pay their bills. The cap is set four times a year by the regulator, Ofgem, and sets the maximum price per unit of energy that suppliers can charge (there is no cap on the maximum bill). Cornwall also expect the cap will fall again in July, followed by a small rise in October.  Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, says:   “Forecasts show energy bills returning to their lowest levels in over two years, providing a much-needed respite for a nation struggling with a cost of living crisis.  “Fairly healthy gas supply across the Atlantic, coupled with high storage levels in Europe, are helping to keep bills down. But we mustn’t get too complacent. Our energy system is still walking a tightrope, and we cannot be sure another political or economic crisis won’t send bills straight back up.  “Even with the drop, prices will remain a struggle for many. We need to remember, bills remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels, and if we don’t speed up the switch to sustainable energy and cut down on volatile imports, they are likely to stay that way.”   Ofgem reveals new level of energy price cap a week today, taking effect from April.Cornwall Insight says it's forecasting cap will be £1,635 (average annual bill) down by 15% - followed by another drop of ~10% in July.Election-timing-watchers can draw their own conclusions...— Hugo Gye (@HugoGye) February 16, 2024      10.36am GMT  Russian central bank holds rates at 16%  Newsflash: Russia’s central bank has held interest rates at 16%, after five hikes in a row since last summer. The Bank of Russia says:  Current inflationary pressures have eased compared with the autumn months but remain high. Domestic demand is still outstripping the capabilities to expand the production of goods and services. A judgement on the sustainable nature of emerging disinflationary trends would be premature. The Bank of Russia’s monetary policy is set to solidify disinflation processes unfolding in the national economy.  Russia’s interest rates have been volatile since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  The Bank of Russia doubled rates to 20% in March 2022 to support the rouble, but then lowered them through 2022 to 7.5%, before starting to hike in summer 2023:     10.24am GMT   Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, flags that insolvencies among building firms climbed last year:  4,378 UK construction firms went out of business in the year to December 2023. This is 5.1% higher than a year ago & 37.9% higher than in the year to January 2020, pre-pandemic, according to this morning's Government Insolvency Service data.

Hussain explains:  “With the latest GDP figures showing that the UK was in a technical recession at the end of last year,the retail, hospitality and construction sectors continue to bear the brunt of insolvencies. These industries, traditionally sensitive to shifts in consumer behaviour and economic conditions, remain under significant pressure due to ongoing challenges, including changing consumer priorities and supply chain disruptions - issues which may not be resolved in the first half of this year.”      9.50am GMT  Insolvencies up 5% year-on-year  Just in: The number of registered company insolvencies in England and Wales jumped 5% on an annual basis last month, although it was lower than in the peak last autumn. There were 1,769 company failures in January, the Insolvency Service reports, up from 1,685 in January 2023, as companies struggled in the tough economic climate. The Insolvency Service reports:  The company insolvencies consisted of 339 compulsory liquidations, 1,294 creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), 120 administrations and 16 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). CVL numbers were lower than in January 2023, while compulsory liquidation and administration numbers were higher.  It’s lower than the 2,470 insolvencies reported in November, though which was the highest since last May. David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP, says high interest rates and rising costs are hitting firms:  “A real concern is that current financial distress spreads further. Last year’s insolvency data shows a large proportion of Creditor’s Voluntary and compulsory liquidations – a sign that many of the closures were among SMEs. Should more mid-market firms start to fail, the impact is likely to have even greater ramifications up and down supply chains. A larger stone ultimately ripples much wider. “Significant trading risks abound for the months ahead. Early interest rate cuts still look unlikely, meaning capital and debt costs will remain high for some time yet. And companies, particularly retailers and hospitality firms, will be bracing themselves for the rise in the National Living Wage in April, which could add further strain to already stretched bottom lines. “There’s good reason to be optimistic that economic conditions will improve this year, but for now businesses are still driving down a bumpy road.”   Updated at 9.52am GMT    9.26am GMT  Moody’s Analytics: Expect first UK rate cut in August  Britain’s fall into recession yesterday sparked talk that the Bank of England could lower interest rates sooner than expected, to prod the economy into growth. But Moody’s Analytics reckons that borrowers may need to wait six months for a cut. In a report released last night, their economist Barbara Teixeira Araujo says:   “While the GDP figures for the fourth quarter were extremely bad, we haven’t changed our outlook for the U.K. economy and for monetary policy. We expect that the economy to hold its ground in 2024 and that the momentum will gradually improve throughout the year. We are pencilling in a 0.3% rise in GDP in 2024, up from 0.1% in 2023. Regarding the BoE, we think the central bank would rather risk waiting a bit too long than cut a bit too early. We still expect a first rate cut in August.”  The money markets are expecting the first rate cut by June, from 5.25% to 5%, with rates seen at 4.5% by the end of 2024.     9.09am GMT   Although retail sales volumes jumped last month, online spending fell by 4.1%. The proportion of sales made online fell from 26.8% in December 2023 to 24.8% in January 2024.  Very decent bounce-back in retail sales volumes, following a less than stellar Christmas trading period. Increases were observed in all retail sub-sectors, bar clothing & footwear. https://t.co/ou8J8u3hGW pic.twitter.com/oYk5AUdfsP— Harvir Dhillon (@HarvirDhillon) February 16, 2024   🖱️ Notable drop-off in the share of retail sales taking place online, however.

This reflected rising levels of consumer confidence, as well as a boost from the January sales. Categories, such as computing, and cosmetic & toiletries performed well. Food sales continued to outstrip non-food sales – mainly due to higher levels of inflation on these products. Nonetheless, shoppers remained cautious as they entered the third year of the high cost of living.      9.03am GMT   French state-owned power giant EDF is taking a €7.9bn impairment charge on its UK operations, due to delays at the troubled Hinkley Point reactor. Hinkley Point reactor, Britain’s first new nuclear plant in more than two decades, has been beset by difficulties – last month, EDF announced it could be delayed by a further four years, and cost £2.3bn more than planned.   Related: Hinkley Point C could be delayed to 2031 and cost up to £35bn, says EDF       8.39am GMT   NatWest’s results show a rise in the number of customer struggling to repay loans – something that is expected to get worse this year. The Bank’s loan impairment rate rose to 15 basis points in 2023, up from 9 basis points in 2022. For 2024, NatWest expects its loan impairment rate to be below 20 basis points. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  Impairment charges were better than expected as customers continued to show remarkable resilience in the face of higher inflation and interest rates. Absent any major shock to unemployment, low default rates are expected to continue over 2024.      8.18am GMT   In the water industry, Sir Adrian Montague, the chairman of Thames Water, has resigned as chairman and director of its parent company, Kemble Water Holdings Limited. Thames Water Utilities Limited (TWUL) say:  This is a personal decision as Sir Adrian believes the time is right solely to focus on fully supporting the Board and Executive Team of TWUL on delivering the refocused turnaround plan in order to better meet our customers’ needs. Sir Adrian Montague remains a director and Chairman of Thames Water.  Earlier this month, regulator Ofwat ordered Thames Water to update its service commitment plan to improve its performance on issues such as sewage dumping. And on Monday, Thames admitted it expects to leak more water than previously thought over the next two years. Clearly Sir Adrian has lots to sort out…     8.03am GMT    👀UK retail sales rose a whopping 3.4% in January, the biggest monthly gain since April 2021. 🇬🇧 pic.twitter.com/pME5WZhGqN— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) February 16, 2024      7.55am GMT  Retail sales jump: What the experts say  The 3.4% rise in UK retail sales volumes last month shows the Bank of England must tread carefully, says Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors:   “UK retail sales for January provided the third data point in three days on the UK economy and painted a somewhat ambiguous picture, coming in much stronger than expected.  The consumer sector bounced back strongly after a weak Christmas period and these numbers suggest that ongoing higher interest rates are not having the dampening effect that was anticipated. The Bank of England will tread a careful path in its decision making as these numbers do not provide them with much clarity.”  Today’s data should cheer retailers, reports Stuart Chalmers, retail industry lead at Accenture UK & Ireland:  “Retailers will be pleased to see this boost at the start of the year, in a week that brought the unwelcome news that the UK has entered a technical recession. Sales rose in most subsectors, with food stores and supermarkets contributing most, but clothing retailers will be disappointed to see a drop in numbers. January’s retail performance will offer hope to a beleaguered sector after a challenging ‘golden quarter’. With inflation continuing to hold steady, retailers should be using data to better understand what customers want, and when they want it. This approach can help to inform their broader strategy, including in their supply chains, through to in-store experiences.”  But Lisa Hooker, leader of industry for consumer markets at PwC, cautions that a sustained economic recovery is months away:  At first glance, January’s retail sales figures appear to contrast with the declining footfall and challenging trading conditions reported by some retailers. However, compared to the rest of the year, it is a much less important month of trading, so these numbers are more reflective of a return to the weak trend of growth we saw in the second half of 2023, rather than the start of a prolonged recovery. While many of the macroeconomic indicators are positive - falling inflation, improving consumer sentiment, the prospect of lower interest rates - consumers remain cautious about spending, particularly in discretionary and big ticket categories, and we do not predict a sustained recovery until the second half of 2024.”      7.38am GMT  NatWest warns economic outlook remains uncertain  NatWest has also warned that “the economic outlook remains uncertain”, telling shareholders:  We will monitor and react to market conditions and refine our internal forecasts as the economic position evolves.  The bank is also predicting that income will fall this year. For 2023, it made total “income excluding notable items” of £14.3bn, a 9.8% rise. But for 2024, NatWest says it expects income excluding notable items to drop to be between £13bn and £13.5bn.     7.22am GMT  NatWest profits rise, as Thwaite named as CEO  NatWest, the bank partly owned by the UK government, has reported a jump in profits this morning – and named its permanent CEO. The taxpayer-backed lender grew its operating profits by 20% year-on-year in 2023, its latest financial results show. This is NatWest’s highest annual profit since the financial crisis (when the bank, then called Royal Bank of Scotland, was bailed out by the taxpayer), and more than the £5.95bn expected by analysts. This could cheer the government as it gears up to sell its remaining stake in the lender to the public this year. NatWest has also appointed Paul Thwaite as its chief executive. Thwaite has been doing the job on an intermi basis since the resignation of Alison Rose last summer over the closure of Nigel Farage’s bank accounts with Coutts, NatWest’s private bank.  Updated at 7.42am GMT    7.22am GMT  Introduction: UK retail sales rebound  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. With Britain now in a technical recession, economic data will be closely scrutinised for signs that the downturn could be ending. And the latest retail sales figures, just released, show that retail sales across Great Britain grew at the fastest rate since April 2021 last month, as consumers returned to the shops after a pre-Christmas slump. Retail sales volume rebounded by 3.4% in January, the Office for National Statistics reports. That follows a record 3.3% tumble in retail spending in December, which flashed warning signs over the economy a month ago.  Retail sales volumes (quantity bought) rebounded 3.4% in January 2024, following a record fall of 3.3% in December 2023.This was the largest monthly rise since April 2021 and returned volumes to November 2023 levels.➡️ https://t.co/ipWNHoU3do pic.twitter.com/4d1LyKkEoP— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 16, 2024  It could be a sign that the UK economy is picking up – as Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested – after shrinking in the second half of last year. The ONS reports that sales volumes in all subsectors, except clothing stores, increased in January. Food stores such as supermarkets contributing most to the increase, with food stores sales volumes rising by 3.4% over the month. The ONS says some of the fall in December was because of consumers purchasing Christmas gifts earlier, during the November Black Friday discounts. But separate ONS polling did find that almost half of adults had expected to spend less on Christmas shopping because of the rising cost of living. Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, says:  “After a very weak December, retail sales rebounded in January with the largest monthly rise since April 2021. This means that overall sales have now recovered to pre-December levels, although if we look at the broader picture, they are still below where they were pre-pandemic. “Sales increased across nearly all retail sectors, and it was a particularly strong month for supermarkets. Household goods stores, sports shops and department store retailers were amongst those reporting robust trading due to January sales promotions. A fall in prices at the pump also meant a solid month for fuel sales. “Clothing shops were the only area not to see growth this month.”  The agenda  7am GMT: UK retail sales for January 10.30am GMT: Bank of Russia’s interest rate decision 1.30pm GMT: US PPI index of producer price inflation for January 1.30pm GMT: US building permits and housing starts data for January   Updated at 9.21am GMT "

        "content": "Journeys on many intercity trains running from London to Edinburgh are more than twice as expensive since the launch of a “simpler fares” initiative designed to make rail ticketing less complex, it has emerged. The train operator LNER started the pilot scheme this month after pledging to make ticketing easier and better value for money with more advance fares for specific trains. However, rail experts and campaigners warned that the move also meant scrapping basic “super off-peak” fares, which guaranteed that tickets on the route between the English and Scottish capitals would be available on many weekday trains and through the weekends for no more than £87. While LNER said cheaper advance tickets would be available up to five minutes before departure, its booking site showed a large number of services could be booked only on “anytime” fares that cost £193 each way. A separate analysis by the Press Association news agency found that many services previously open to holders of super off-peak tickets were now selling only on the day with fully flexible anytime tickets, more than £100 more expensive. Even where cheaper options were available – either fixed advance tickets or new semi-flexible “70min flex” tickets, which allow passengers to take the following train from the one booked – fares were sometimes more expensive than the previous super off-peak price. The change, which applies only on journeys between London and Newcastle, Berwick and Edinburgh, is a two-year trial but similar pilots – such as single-leg pricing – that have been trialled on the state-owned LNER have since been made permanent and extended to other operators. Campaigners urged the firm to rethink, describing the prices as “beyond tolerable”. Mark Smith, the expert behind the Man in Seat 61 website, told the Guardian last month the move could mean the end of affordable, walk-up travel on the route. He told PA: “It’s now pretty clear to everyone that the LNER fares ‘simplification’ was a smokescreen for removing the off-peak fare to allow big price increases. As a trial simplification for passengers it has already failed and should not be extended.” Smith said passengers from London could bypass the trial and still buy an £87 super off-peak ticket to Haymarket, one station beyond Edinburgh, if necessary. Neil Middleton, a director at the campaign group Railfuture, said the removal of the super off-peak ticket was “an awful move”. “If you need to travel unexpectedly or travel plans change, these are eye-watering prices to pay. I think they are well beyond tolerable for most people’s wallets and indeed most companies’ expense claims,” he added. An LNER spokesperson said: “Since the pilot launched, the majority of customers who have bought advance tickets have paid less than the old super off-peak fare. We’ll continue to monitor and will make adjustments so that as many people as possible can access the right ticket at the right price for them.” The operator believes the new fares will more closely reflect demand and lead to fewer instances of overcrowding on trains. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “LNER’s trial is part of a longstanding commitment to simplify complicated ticketing, which can often put people off taking the train. “Through this, the majority of passengers on these routes will find fares to be the same or cheaper than the old super off-peak fare.”"

        "content": "NatWest made its biggest annual profit last year since the 2007 financial crisis, helped by high interest rates, as the bank confirmed the interim boss, Paul Thwaite, would permanently take over as its chief executive before a public sale of its government-owned shares. The UK lender – which is still 35% government-owned – said pre-tax profits rose 20% to £6.2bn in the year to December. That is higher than analyst forecasts for £6bn, and marks its largest annual profit recorded since it made £10bn in 2007, the year before excesses led to a £45.5bn public rescue that has yet to be fully unwound 16 years later. Bumper profits in 2023 came as the bank made more money from loans and mortgages, compared with what it paid to savers, after another year of interest rate increases by the Bank of England. Those earnings, known as net interest income, rose 12% to £11bn. It sent NatWest shares up more than 5%, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100.   Related: Tesco to sell bulk of banking business to Barclays for £700m   The bank’s bonus pool for bankers fell 3% to £356m despite the jump in profits. NatWest said this reflected the impact on shareholders, after the bank missed previous earnings guidance. Shareholders will receive a £1bn payout, with a final dividend worth 11.5p a share, and have a chance to take part in a £300m share buyback programme. The earnings results will set a high benchmark for Thwaite, who NatWest confirmed on Friday would take over permanently as chief executive with immediate effect, running the bank alongside the incoming chair, Rick Haythornthwaite. Thwaite was paid £1.7m pay package for the year, including a £245,000 cash bonus, and other benefits such as £21,000 for business travel and £1,700 for home security. Thwaite, who previously ran NatWest’s business banking division, took over as the interim chief executive in July after his predecessor, Alison Rose, was forced to quit over a debanking row with Nigel Farage. Thwaite’s appointment will help pave the way for government plans to sell shares in NatWest to the general public later this year, after the state agency that manages the taxpayer stake said the market needed reassurance on NatWest’s leadership before going ahead. The debanking controversy started when Coutts – the NatWest-owned private bank for the ultra-wealthy – planned to shut Farage’s bank accounts, and snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents that showed the bank had concerns over his political views. The scandal escalated when it emerged that Rose had discussed Farage’s case with a BBC journalist. Rose was forced to forgo £7.6m in pay from NatWest, although independent lawyers hired by the bank concluded she had made an “an honest mistake” in speaking with the BBC and that concerns over Farage’s political views were not the driving factor in the decision to shut his accounts. While the jump in earnings will be a relief after a tumultuous year, there are signs that profit growth could slow. NatWest warned that total income was expected to drop to £13bn-£13.5bn in 2024, from £14.8bn this year, adding: “The economic outlook remains uncertain.” The bank’s forecasts point to a drop in inflation to 2.5% by the end of 2024 – from 4% now – leading to a cut in interest rates to 4% from current levels of 5.25%, which could put pressure on net interest income. Thwaite said the encouraging news on inflation was also being offset by other factors, including the government’s removal of energy bill support and the fact that millions of homeowners were still set to roll off fixed mortgage terms on to higher rates. That bank had seen customers try to “take more control of their spending” and were supplementing their income, including through cashback sites and secondhand shops online. However, Thwaite said the bank was going into 2024 “focused on the things we can control; delivering profitable growth, becoming more efficient, more productive, and simpler to deal with, while managing our cost and capital efficiently. Together, these actions will drive long-term, sustainable value for our customers, shareholders, and the wider UK economy.”"

        "content": "Retailers in Great Britain enjoyed the strongest rebound in monthly sales in almost three years in January as people returned to the shops after a slump in Christmas shopping. Sales rose by 3.4% last month, the biggest monthly increase since April 2021, as all retail sectors except clothing stores experienced gains, providing welcome relief after dire Christmas trading, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Supermarkets had a good month, as did sports shops and department stores. Retail sales in the crucial festive season fell by more than initially estimated, after the ONS revised a 3.2% monthly decline in December to 3.3%, the biggest fall since shops were forced to close during the Covid pandemic in 2021.   Related: Piece of London’s Jewish East End feared lost as Beigel Shop shuts   The better-than-expected retail sales data comes a day after official figures showed the UK fell into a recession, at the end of last year, dealing a blow to Rishi Sunak and his pledge to grow the economy.  The economy shrank by 0.3% in the final three months of 2023, after shrinking by 0.1% in the previous three months, meeting the definition of a technical recession – two successive quarters of falling gross domestic product. However, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, downplayed the significance of the quarterly GDP figures, suggesting there were signs of an upturn in the economy that would become clearer in the months ahead. Responding to the figures showing the UK was in recession, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said on Thursday the battle to tame the rate of inflation meant the economy was always going to enter low-growth mode, adding that the economy “is turning a corner”. However, despite the increase in sales in January, the ONS said inflation-fuelled price rises meant consumers spent more for less, with the rise in the amount spent increasing 3.9% month on month but the volume of goods sold climbing up at a lower 3.4%. “Sales increased across nearly all retail sectors, and it was a particularly strong month for supermarkets,” said Heather Bovill, a deputy director at the ONS. “Household goods stores, sports shops and department store retailers were among those reporting robust trading due to January sales promotions. A fall in prices at the pump also meant a solid month for fuel sales.” Department stores and other non-food shops, such as retailers of sports equipment, games and toys, watches and jewellery, were the biggest winners, reporting monthly sales increases of 5.4% and 6.2% respectively. This was partly because of retailers in these sectors reporting the worst trading figures last month, with department store sales slumping 7.1% and other non-food stores sales down 4.5% in December. Sales rose 1.8%in household goods stores in January, mainly because of a boost at hardware shops. Clothing was the only retail sector with a continued decline in sales, which fell 1.4% month on month in January after a 1.5% fall in December. Supermarkets and food stores also reported strong trading, with month-on-month sales rising 3.4% in January, recovering from a record 3.1% in December when consumers cut back on festive spending. The ONS said the December slump and January bounceback was mainly because of the performance of supermarkets. Non-food shops – including department stores, clothing and household outlets combined – achieved a 3% monthly sales increase after falling 3.9% in December. Sales of fuel increased at 5.4% month on month in January as consumers took advantage of falling prices at the pump. Samantha Phillips, a partner at McKinsey & Company, said: “Household budgets will remain under pressure, and discerning consumers will remain mindful about where they hold back spending and where they splurge.  “Retailers may have to find new ways to appeal to consumers in a recessionary environment. With tactical cost savings mostly exhausted, they will likely focus on share growth, while looking at fundamental business model shifts such as gen AI opportunities and data and loyalty programmes.”"

        "content": "By road, the 280-mile journey from Hadrian’s Wall to Peterhead takes in stunning Scottish countryside, quaint villages and busy suburbs. But the lengthy route is also to become a building site for vast power lines connecting offshore windfarms with urban centres. The Scottish route, and other big lines including another following the M6 through Cumbria, is expected to be part of a “national transmission plan” being devised by National Grid, which could be published in time for March’s budget. The drive to net zero is expected to increase demand for electricity supplies, and Great Britain’s grid is being rewired and expanded to accommodate the many new green energy projects. Policymakers face a tricky decade as the target of decarbonising the electricity system by 2035 collides with the day-to-day job of keeping the lights on and ensuring electric vehicles, heat pumps and industrial machinery are powered. In worst-case scenarios, Britain’s power plants will struggle to meet the surging demand forecast in the early 2030s if a series of nascent technologies – from hydrogen power stations to carbon capture and storage (CCS) – struggle to take off. The scenarios vary wildly, but doomsday predictions leave Britain with 39 gigawatts less power than previous forecasts. This could mean 28 hours – just over a day – during the year 2035 when there will not be enough supply to meet demand. The shortfall is being called the electricity gap.  Interactive  The issue threatens to present a further energy headache for the Labour party after it rowed back on its £28bn green spending plan, a reversal some fear could deter overseas investors from backing UK power generation projects. Energy security shot up the agenda after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 left countries scrambling to secure gas supplies, as concern grew about rolling blackouts. The potential shortfall has resurfaced in recent weeks as market headwinds for low carbon projects have drawn sharper focus on the long-term future of Britain’s gas plants, which were the biggest source of electricity, at 35.7%, last month. A further delay to Hinkley Point C has added fuel to the argument that building new nuclear plants is too slow and costly. The vast project in Somerset was originally expected to be completed by 2017 but has been repeatedly held up and is now not expected until 2031. It is also unclear whether and when a proposed sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk will begin generating power. After 2028, Sizewell B will be the only remaining plant generating in the British nuclear fleet, until its planned shutdown in 2035. However, sources said the lifetime of remaining plants at Hartlepool, Heysham and Torness may be further extended and a fleet of smaller reactors is planned. Meanwhile, windfarm planning has been shaken by supply chain problems that forced the world’s biggest developer, Ørsted, to scale back, and for Sweden’s Vattenfall to pull out of a huge offshore project  off the Norfolk coast after they said rising costs meant it was no longer profitable. Tom Glover, the UK chair of the power generator RWE, says: “Post-Covid and the gas price increase every government has realised that renewables is the way to go and there’s a supply chain squeeze.” A cluster of new technologies offer an uncertain salvation. Switching gas-fired plants to green hydrogen appears viable, but costly; CCS allows fossil fuel stations to continue but is unproven at scale; and large battery projects, which are designed to store renewable energy when there is little sun or wind, are facing a backlog to connect to the grid. In a report into “resource adequacy”, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO), which is tasked with balancing supply and demand, says “a failure of some key low-carbon technologies to deliver, such as hydrogen, new nuclear or CCS, does not imperil security of supply. However if all these technologies fail to come to fruition, the GB system will struggle to meet security of supply using battery technologies alone.” Glover plays down the concerns over a shortfall in electricity production, arguing the life of gas plants can be extended. “We do not see a big risk as long as the operational and environmental permits are still in place,” he says. “Each station is inspected every five years to decide whether to refurbish them. It’s like Trigger’s broom, we can keep refurbishing power stations as long as they need to run. If the market is in place and working, they will work.” Glover does bemoan difficulties connecting to the grid – RWE’s planned plant at Stallingborough in Lincolnshire could be ready by 2030, but has been allotted a connection in 2035. Regulators’ efforts to tackle this, such as kicking “zombie” projects out of the queue to be connected to the grid, could offer a solution. As could changing consumption patterns. Nigel Pocklington, the chief executive of the green household supplier Good Energy, says he would like to see a move from Labour on “unblocking access to the grid”, adding: “A lot of our planning centres on peak demand but we will make a big dent if consumers are more flexible with cars charging overnight and usage shifted from peak times.” Britain’s future energy mix has become heavily politicised. Campaigners argue Rishi Sunak’s “plan to back drivers” will stifle green progress. Within Labour, there appear to be tensions over the party’s target to decarbonise power by 2030 and how practical a target to only use gas-fired stations as a backup really is. Sources say much of Labour’s working assumptions on energy mix are based on Drax, a biomass power plant in North Yorkshire, continuing to produce a significant chunk of Britain’s electricity. This is despite the heavy criticism, including from Labour MPs, that the plant has received over its green credentials and receipt of huge subsidies. There is also a question mark within the party on how much money to commit to decarbonising home heating (although lobbying efforts by gas firms to push for hydrogen have been dented). “We do not get anywhere near our climate goals without electrification of heat,” says Pocklington. “There is going to have to be a willingness to take on the vested interests who are very powerful – the unions and gas companies who have a lot to protect.” Two deals offer an intriguing backdrop to conversations between government and energy executives. In July, National Grid is expected to complete the spinout of the ESO to create a nationalised systems operator. Bankers at Citi are understood to be forensically studying the ESO’s costs on behalf of National Grid and the final price is likely to draw scrutiny amid concerns that the taxpayer may overpay. Meanwhile, the infrastructure investor Macquarie’s acquisition of a further 20% of Britain’s gas transmission grid has been delayed as it is faces scrutiny under the National Security and Investment Act 2021. An industry source says: “Everything relating to government decarbonisation targets has an asterisk with ‘subject to security of supply’ attached.” The path to relying solely on green power appears as long as the journey to Peterhead. • This article was amended on 16 February 2024. Though Vattenfall pulled out of an offshore project in Norfolk, the project itself was not “scrapped” as an earlier version said."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been warned against launching a fresh austerity drive after official figures confirmed Britain’s economy is in recession and living standards have suffered their longest sustained fall since records began almost 70 years ago. With the government under pressure over its economic management, Treasury sources said the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was considering a fresh squeeze on public spending to finance pre-election tax cuts in next month’s budget. But unions said it was an “outrage” that the chancellor was looking to balance the books by forcing more austerity on to services that were already on their knees – while a leading thinktank described any moves to cut taxes as “ludicrous”. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy shrank by 0.3% in the three months to December, handing Labour the ammunition to claim Sunak’s plans lay “in tatters” after 14 years of the Conservatives underinvesting in Britain. The contraction followed a drop of 0.1% in the three months to September, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output – the technical definition of a recession – with the ONS warning that the picture would have looked even worse had it not been for a rising population. Highlighting a deep economic malaise amid the cost of living crisis, the figures revealed national income per head fell or flatlined for seven consecutive quarters – the worst run since modern records began in 1955. In a bid to regain ground after a highly damaging week for Labour, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, insisted the opposition had a plan to kickstart growth and rejected criticism the party lacked difference from the Conservatives. “This is Rishi’s recession,” Reeves said. “He says he has a plan, but the plan is not working. We are going backwards.” The contraction in national output has blown a hole in the prime minister’s five key priorities for 2023, with a growing economy now joining a cut to NHS waiting lists as an undelivered promise, exposing Sunak to heavy fire from within his own ranks as the party prepares to defend its record in the run-up to an election. Hunt insisted the worst for the economy was over and that Britain was “turning a corner” as he made the case for a tax-cutting budget next month to reboot the Tories’ standing in opinion polls. “Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan – cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy,” he said. With the government scrambling to restore economic credibility, Hunt’s allies say he is determined to offer an agenda-setting package of tax cuts at the 6 March budget, even if they are unlikely to be on the same scale as the 2p cut to national insurance announced at the autumn statement in November. However, Britain’s weaker growth performance could constrain his room for tax giveaways. The chancellor is thought to have been left with about £8bn less to play with than previously thought thanks to the rising cost of government debt, which is likely to leave him with around £13bn of headroom in March. As a result, sources said Hunt was considering steeper departmental cuts to take effect after the election, to the dismay of trade unions who warned of severe damage from a fresh austerity drive with public services already in steep decline. “It is an outrage that the chancellor is again looking to use a recession he caused as an excuse to load more austerity on to public services that are already on their knees,” said Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary. “Labour needs to pay attention – this government’s disastrous economic decision-making is not a model to follow.” Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said the recession news should serve as a wake-up call for the government and opposition parties in the run-up to the election. “We’ve got to do better than today’s debate about ludicrous tax cuts we can’t afford, and pencilled in spending cuts we can’t deliver,” he said. The ONS said that over the course of 2023 the economy had essentially flatlined, expanding by just 0.1%. It was the weakest performance outside of the pandemic year of 2020 since the UK was gripped by the global financial crisis in 2009. Tim Leunig, a former economic adviser to Sunak during his time as chancellor, said seven quarters of falling living standards was “something that has not happened since records began almost 70 years ago. Our country is in a deep, deep mess.” Reeves last week watered down plans to spend £28bn a year on greening the economy but “entirely rejected” accusations that the U-turn meant Labour was offering no real alternative to existing policies. “Unlike this prime minister and this chancellor, Keir Starmer and I have got a real plan,” she said. “The Conservatives have no plan. We have a serious plan that we’ve worked on with business and the green prosperity plan is still there. “A national wealth fund to invest in carbon capture and storage, in green hydrogen, in our steel industry, as well as Great British energy with an endowment to invest in nuclear, tidal and floating offshore wind, there’s a plan.” The shadow chancellor said Labour would be fighting the election on the economy and would be asking voters whether they felt better off than when the Tories came to power in 2010. “It is time to turn the page on 14 years of economic failure,” she said. Reeves refused to be drawn on whether she would back the tax cuts widely expected from Hunt in next month’s budget. Any support from Labour would depend on the state of the public finances and the forecasts from the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. Asked about murmurs that Hunt was planning tax cuts which might entail spending cuts on public services, in a possible trap for Labour ahead of the election, she said: “I do recognise that our public services are under huge pressure, unlike perhaps the Conservatives do, which is why I’ve said there does need to be an immediate injection of cash into our public services.” Economists had widely expected a shallow recession at the end of last year as households came under pressure from higher borrowing costs and rising prices for everyday essentials, forcing cuts elsewhere. Widespread strikes across the economy and heavy rainfall also dampened activity. More recent snapshots from the economy have, however, shown a rebound in consumer confidence. Nevertheless, many Tories acknowledge that the political damage may already have been done. George Osborne, the former chancellor, said on his Political Currency podcast: “It will cast a pall over the government’s economic message, there’s no doubt about that. The government will have a tougher time with their economic message.” • This article was amended on 16 February 2024 to correctly paraphrase remarks by Tim Leunig that were posted on X."

        "content": "The UK economy needs a lift after it sank into recession in the second half of 2023. It’s not an easy task when so many of the problems are longstanding and the measures needed for a cure could take years to have an effect. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has hinted that tax cuts on personal incomes could be included in his budget next month, even though they could trigger a sugar rush of spending that would fuel inflation and persuade the Bank of England to delay the date of its first cuts in interest rates. As an alternative, here are five ways the government – with some help from the Bank -could get the economy moving again without triggering the return of inflation or spooking the global financial markets as Liz Truss managed to do in September 2022. 1 Unfreezing the tax thresholds and taxing wealth Income is more heavily taxed than wealth. It is a fact that has become more pressing in the years since the 2008 financial crash, when the accumulation of wealth has far outpaced rising wages. Rishi Sunak’s major tax initiative was to freeze personal tax and national insurance thresholds in April 2022, pushing more people into higher tax brackets. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Treasury could rake in as much as £52bn by 2028. Ending the freeze would be costly, and could boost spending, making the Bank think twice about interest rate cuts, but the effect could be offset by a shift to some kind of tax on wealth. There is little agreement about what wealth should be taxed and how, but there are some easy wins. Council tax bands in England could be extended beyond band H as they have been in Wales to capture the value of more expensive homes, handing local authorities more money. And multimillionaires are ready to pay more, according to a poll last month that coincided with a gathering of powerful policymakers and the super rich at the World Economic Forum in Davos. A majority supported the introduction of a 2% wealth tax on people with more than $10m (£8m). 2 A broad-based devolution to cities and regions Devolution is a risky endeavour for any government. Several of the councils that have gone bust over the last two years have made bad decisions and racked up huge losses. But a more robust structure – one that balances autonomy with responsibility and predictable revenues – could ignite growth in the regions. Levelling up the north, Midlands and west of England with London and the south-east has proved to be impossible when it relies on civil servants doling out small packets of cash after a complicated bidding process. Achieving net zero would be more likely without the dead hand of Whitehall on every council’s shoulder. 3 Bring down interest rates This is not in Hunt’s gift, but lower rates would hand some money back to beleaguered mortgage payers and businesses. According to the latest retail prices index figures, mortgage inflation is running at 45%, which is crippling for those who need to re-finance their loans. Britain, like most developed countries, is highly indebted, so small adjustments to interest rates can make a big difference to the annual costs of borrowing. The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates eight times a year, meets again next month, but is not expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing – currently 5.25% – until June at the earliest. There are plenty of economists who believe the GDP figures are bad enough to change the MPC’s stance. 4 Boost social housing Private housebuilders prefer to drip-feed the property market with new homes to maintain prices, making them a fair-weather friend of any government that wants to increase the housing stock. A government that wants to encourage the building of green homes on a consistent trajectory, eliminating boom and bust, could turn to housing associations and other social landlords. They are suffering from a lack of funds and high borrowing costs on their existing stock of loans. The Treasury could help out by lending at lower interest rates and going some way to answering the industry’s request for £15bn a year to build 90,000 homes for people on low incomes. 5 Support to get the long-term sick back to work The legacy of Covid-19 is a lengthy list of people suffering from the long-term effects on their physical and mental health. Recent figures have shown the trend is getting worse, forcing more people each month out of the jobs market. Hunt has pledged to increase spending on mental health services and reduce hospital waiting lists, but there needs to be a more concerted, tailored effort from government. The payback would be a larger, fitter, happier workforce that would increase the productive capacity of the economy. It would also help the Bank bring down rates by tackling its concern that a shortage of workers will be a permanent feature of the jobs market which will see employers forced to pay higher wages and increase what they charge for their services, locking the economy into an even longer period of stagnant growth and rising prices, or stagflation."

And, according to X, it delivered: almost 350 “clicks”. To me, 350 “clicks” means that users saw my post, were interested in my book and clicked through to my landing page to download it. Exciting, right? Three hundred and fifty leads would be amazing. Even half that amount would be fantastic. I was excited. But not for long. Unfortunately, there was a bit of a discrepancy. During that same period, according to Google Analytics, my landing page received fewer than 10 views. And how many of those views came from X? Zero. I asked a few social media “experts” I know about this anomaly and they all offered similar responses: bots. You know, those non-human software robots that proliferate everywhere. Few, if any, of those clicks were actually human, they said. Who’s actually auditing this data? How do I ever find out if any real people clicked? Is anyone independently verifying these numbers? I don’t know these answers. No one does. Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment, but I’ve been down this road before. I’ve tried advertising on Facebook, Google and YouTube with equally underwhelming results. These services routinely take their advertisers’ money and deliver little in return. It’s why “ad fraud” reportedly cost businesses more than $61bn in 2022 and is expected to grow to more than $100bn over the next few years. This doesn’t mean that a business can’t successfully advertise online. Many do. How? I’m not sure but I’m thinking it’s a combination of luck, perseverance and – spoiler alert – spending lots and lots of cash. Sure, I only dropped $50 but do you really think it would have been very different if I dropped $500, $5,000? I suspect that if I were forking over millions of dollars to X, Facebook or Google, the wizards behind the curtain would pay special attention to helping me draw clicks from users who possess actual beating hearts and working lungs. My “luck” would certainly improve. But, sadly, that’s not the case. The world of online advertising is not a world for small business owners like me. I certainly don’t have the resources to attract the attention of the powers that be. I’ll always be outspent and outsmarted by the big brands. This is the lesson I’ve learned. Not bad for $50."

        "content": "Britain’s public spending watchdog has launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield, the UK’s biggest nuclear waste dump. The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises the use of public funds, has announced it will examine whether the Cumbria site is managing and prioritising the risks and hazards of the site effectively as well as deploying resources appropriately and continuing to improve its project management. The findings of its investigation are expected to be published this autumn. Sellafield is Europe’s most toxic nuclear site and also one of the UK’s most expensive infrastructure projects, with the NAO estimating it could cost £84bn to maintain the site into the next century. Last year, Nuclear Leaks, a Guardian investigation into activities at Sellafield, revealed problems with cybersecurity, a radioactive leak and a “toxic” workplace culture at the waste dump. Predictions of the ultimate bill for the site, which holds about 85% of the UK’s nuclear waste, vary. It cost £2.5bn to run the site last year, and the government estimates it could ultimately take £263bn to manage the country’s ageing nuclear sites, of which Sellafield accounts for the largest portion. The site employs about 11,000 people and is the world’s largest store of plutonium. It comprises more than 1,000 buildings, many of which were not created with the intention of becoming long-term storage facilities for radioactive material. Sellafield is so expensive that the Office for Budget Responsibility, which monitors threats to the UK government’s finances, has warned that it and other legacy sites pose a “material source of fiscal risk” to the country. The NAO previously examined activities at Sellafield in 2018. It found some aspects of project management had improved but that more needed to be done to get a grip on vast costs and risks. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO at that time, found that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which is tasked with management of Sellafield, needed to improve its explanation of its progress so that parliament could hold it to account. This challenge was underlined when the Guardian uncovered how a worsening leak from a huge silo of radioactive waste at Sellafield could pose a risk to the public. The leak, from one of the “highest nuclear hazards in the UK” – a decaying building known as the Magnox swarf storage silo – is expected to continue for at least a further 30 years. This could have “potentially significant consequences” if it gathers pace, risking the contamination of groundwater, according to an official document. This was just one of a catalogue of safety risks arising from ageing infrastructure at the site. A document sent to members of the Sellafield board in November 2022, and seen by the Guardian, raised widespread concerns about a degradation of safety across the site, warning of the “cumulative risk” from failings ranging from nuclear safety to asbestos and fire standards. Responding to the issues late last year, a Sellafield spokesperson said: “The nature of our site means that until we complete our mission, our highest hazard facilities will always pose a risk.” Sellafield is owned by the NDA, a quango sponsored and funded by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero that is tasked with cleaning 17 sites across the UK. The NDA said it had a “responsibility to deliver for the public, including on value for money”. “We welcome this continued scrutiny and look forward to working with the NAO,” a spokesperson said."
