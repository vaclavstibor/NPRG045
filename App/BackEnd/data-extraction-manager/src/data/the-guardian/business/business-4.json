        "content": "The Post Office’s pursuit of 3,500 post office operators over 16 years with wrongful allegations of theft, fraud and false accounting has had a life-changing impact on those targeted. Despite knowing there were faults with the Horizon accounting software that the operators were using, more than 900 were prosecuted and at least four suicides have been linked to the scandal. Many of those affected have told heartbreaking stories about the financial and personal ramifications of being prosecuted and convicted to the ongoing public inquiry into one of the worst miscarriages of justice in UK history. Seema Misra Seema Misra was sentenced to 15 months in prison for theft and locked up on her son’s 10th birthday while eight weeks pregnant. She recalls being sent to a “horrendous” jail in Ashford, Surrey, Europe’s largest female prison, where she was placed on suicide watch after collapsing in court. Among many other horrors she faced while incarcerated, Misra discovered a prisoner who had taken her own life and has said she would have killed herself in prison if she had not been pregnant. Misra gave birth to her second child in hospital wearing an electronic tag after she was released early for good behaviour. It took 11 years to prove her innocence; she was cleared in 2021. The 47-year-old post office operator from Surrey has told the inquiry into the scandal that Post Office bosses “acted like mafia” and said they had “blood on their hands”. Her trial, in October 2010, became a test case for the reliability of Horizon, with her legal team telling the court that data from the computer accounting system could not be trusted. While emails have revealed that Post Office lawyers had a report about a Horizon bug creating shortfalls at 40 branches in early October 2010, it was not disclosed to the defence at Misra’s trial later that month. When she was convicted bosses celebrated. David Smith, then managing director, hailed her imprisonment as “brilliant news”. Lee Castleton Lee Castleton was made bankrupt by the Post Office after a two-year legal battle, in one of the most high-profile Horizon cases. Castleton bought a post office in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in 2003. However, within a year his computer system showed a £25,000 shortfall, despite him calling the Post Office’s helpline 91 times as he suspected the Horizon IT system was at fault. He was taken to court by the Post Office, where he had to represent himself as he could not afford a lawyer, and was ordered to repay the money and pay costs of £321,000, which bankrupted him. After the legal action, Castleton was forced to close his shop, sell his house and move into rented accommodation, while his wife suffered stress-induced seizures and his children had to move schools because of bullying. Castleton said of the bankruptcy: “It changed our lives completely. It was absolutely terrible and devastating.” At the public inquiry, Stephen Dilley, who represented the Post Office in the civil claim against Castleton, admitted that the Post Office knew he would not be able to pay if he lost but that the state-owned company wanted to “show the world” it would defend the Horizon system. Siobhan Sayer Siobhan Sayer, 55, has told how she was separated from her distressed six-month-old daughter during a raid by investigators who visited her home in 2008 seeking £18,000 in funds missing from her Post Office business. “They went through kitchen drawers, the filing cabinet, [and] tipped my underwear drawer upside down while joking about where I hid the money, saying it would be much easier if I told them where it was,” she told the Horizon IT inquiry last year. “I was humiliated, terrified. I had a six-month-old daughter. I wasn’t allowed to see her. She started crying and I wasn’t allowed to leave to go and see her. That ended me. I had to end the interview as I couldn’t continue any longer.” Sayer said that during the lengthy investigation she felt “generally harassed and intimidated”, including regularly finding someone parked outside her house. Ultimately, on the advice of lawyers, she pleaded guilty to charges of false accounting in 2010 – on the day of her daughter’s birthday. She attended sentencing at court with a suitcase packed believing she would be sent straight to jail, and thinking “it would be left to dad to discuss [my incarceration] with them”. Sayer received a 40-week custodial sentence suspended for 18 months and 200 hours of community service and was allowed to return home. Janet Skinner Janet Skinner, 52, lost her house after being given a nine-month sentence in 2007 after being wrongly jailed over an accounting error. The ordeal of the prosecution process, of which the public inquiry heard testimony that an investigator told an assisting lawyer she did not believe Skinner had stolen any money and that there was no evidence to prove it, had a dramatic impact on the health of the mother of two. Amid the stress of a lengthy fight to prove she could not pay the allegedly missing money Skinner suffered a neurological collapse and was left paralysed from the neck down. She had to learn to walk again, a rehabilitation process that took two years, and is still unable to work. Skinner believes her disability was brought on by the stress of her ordeal. Timothy Burgess “I got tarred overnight,” Timothy Burgess, a former post office operator from the village of Catterick in North Yorkshire, told the inquiry. “People ignored me, crossed the street. People were hostile. I ‘killed the village’ – I had that levelled at me.” Burgess, who took over the sub-post office in July 2006, remembers noticing shortfalls the first day the IT system was installed. He was branded as “inept” by prosecutors who claimed he had been unable to cope with the demand of the job because he also ran a cafe and pub in the village. He was accused of being responsible for a deficit of cash and items such as postal orders and stamps totalling more than £7,500. Ultimately, he admitted false accounting and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay £500 court costs when he was convicted in 2011. Judge Peter Bowers said at the time: “Your dishonesty was not taking money, but covering up your incompetence to the Post Office.” Burgess’s relationship with his daughter “deteriorated quite a bit” and even a shift to a new school 30 miles away “was not far enough” to avoid the scandal. An attempt by his sister-in-law to buy the village pet store, something she “had her heart set on”, was thwarted by the owner because of her association with Burgess. His prosecution was one of 39 overturned by the court of appeal in 2021."

        "content": "Post office operators whose lives have been ruined by the Horizon scandal could be exonerated under plans being considered by the government, Rishi Sunak has said.\nThe prime minister also confirmed that Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, could strip the Post Office of its powers to prosecute after more than 700 branch managers were wrongly handed criminal convictions.\nIt follows a national outcry over the treatment of post office operators between 1999 and 2015 after faulty Fujitsu software made it appear as though money was missing from their outlets.\nThis week, an ITV drama has highlighted the scandal and heightened demands for the government to take action.\nHundreds were jailed or left bankrupt and at least four people took their own lives. Most victims have not received compensation.\nAsked whether the justice secretary was looking at plans to exonerate the victims or take away the Post Office’s ability to prosecute, Sunak said: “The justice secretary is looking at the things that you’ve described. It wouldn’t be right to pre-empt that process, obviously there’s legal complexity in all of those things, but he is looking at exactly those areas.”\nIn an appearance on BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, he added: “Everyone has been shocked by watching what they have done over the past few days and beyond and it is an appalling miscarriage of justice.\n“Actually seeing it and hearing about it again just shows what an appalling miscarriage of justice it is for everyone affected and it’s important that those people now get the justice they deserve.”\nChalk is looking at potential ways for the Post Office to be stripped of its role in the cases of operators who are seeking to appeal and overturn their convictions, it is understood.\nAccording to the Sunday Times, this includes whether the Crown Prosecution Service could take over, which may make it easier for convictions to be quashed.\nTo date, 93 convictions have been overturned and, of those, only 27 people have agreed “full and final settlements”.\nA source told the Sunday Times that Chalk had long held concerns about the ability of some arm’s-length bodies to mount private prosecutions, as well as the low rate of successful appeals among post office operators.\nEven after the Horizon computer system was found to be defective, the Post Office has in recent years opposed a number of appeals by operators.\nEarlier this week, ITV began broadcasting Mr Bates vs the Post Office, a four-part drama charting the scandal and the fight for justice by wrongly prosecuted branch owner-operators.\nFifty new potential victims have contacted lawyers this week, including five who wish to appeal against their convictions.\nVictims of the scandal are “traumatised”, a former post office operator has said. Lee Castleton, who was forced into bankruptcy after being pursued through the courts for hundreds of thousands of pounds in Post Office legal costs, said: “The victims are traumatised. It has been a long time of 25 years, and £135m has been paid to some of the victims, but we have had £150m-plus paid to lawyers.\n“These lawyers are putting lots of pressure and it is difficult. The schemes are difficult.\n“We are just normal run-of-the-mill people. We have legal people with us but it is so difficult and it is like a war.”\n“Why would anybody put the Post Office and DBT [the Department for Business and Trade] in charge of recompensing the victims?” said Castleton, who was played by the actor Will Mellor in the drama.\nIt is not known how much cash was paid back for imaginary shortfalls but so far £151m has been paid in compensation. Operators claimed tens of millions of pounds wrongly clawed back went into Post Office profits.\nThe Post Office is under criminal investigation over “potential fraud offences” committed during the Horizon scandal, the Metropolitan police have confirmed.\nOfficers were “investigating potential fraud offences arising out of these prosecutions”, for example “monies recovered from subpostmasters [operators] as a result of prosecutions or civil actions”, Scotland Yard said on Friday evening.\nThe Met is also investigating two former Fujitsu experts, who were witnesses in the trials, for perjury and perverting the course of justice.\nThere are also growing calls for Paula Vennells, who served as chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019, to be stripped of her CBE. Last night a petition demanding she lose the honour had garnered more than 760,000 signatures."

        "content": "The contours of the election campaign are becoming clear. Do the Conservatives deserve five more years of trying to improve Britain’s lot, despite the abject failure of the past 14? Can Labour under Keir Starmer be trusted to do better? At the start of yet another crunch year in British politics, Rishi Sunak will be hoping the latter question resonates with voters, as the Tory election machine revs up to cast “Slippery Starmer” as an untrustworthy, high tax-and-spend Labour leader who would bankrupt Britain. It is a familiar ploy. Ever since Labour’s 1992 defeat to John Major, the Tories have recycled versions of their “tax bombshell” attack line and more often than not it has worked, helped by the mess of the 2008 financial crisis. This time, however, talk of unexploded Labour ordnance is wearing thin. Despite a rushed-through cut in national insurance over the weekend, most voters know the cost of living is not getting any easier. The economy has been left a smouldering wreck by 14 years of Tory rule, with the car crash Liz Truss premiership only the tip of the iceberg.   Related: Tories have plenty of weak spots – and dislike years that end in four | Larry Elliott   Ahead of the election Labour has come under fire over how it will fund its £28bn pledge to invest in green industry. But Tory backbenchers are pushing for billions of pounds in tax cuts with far more questionable economic benefits. Lacking in humility, Truss’s erstwhile chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is demanding “bold tax cuts”, amid a Tory bidding war to decide the biggest electoral bung. For all the focus on a future Labour government’s tax and spending, a reminder of the path mapped out by the Conservatives ought not to be forgotten: the Tory plan, labelled “plain implausible” by the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, relies on fantasy assumptions to meet fiscal rules requiring debt to fall as a share of the economy within five years’ time. At the autumn statement, Jeremy Hunt failed to address several major pressures on the public finances, while leaving billions of pounds worth of Tory tax and spending promises off the official record of government policy. Top of the list is £20bn of cuts to public spending pencilled in for after the general election, representing a tougher austerity drive than George Osborne’s slash-and-burn agenda. Few economists think this would be wise when hospitals, schools and the wider public sector are on their knees.   Related: Labour is on course for victory – but what kind of economy will it inherit? | Larry Elliott   Next is fuel duty, due to rise by 8p per litre from the end of March at a cost of about £6bn a year for motorists. Having been frozen since 2011, and ahead of an election, there is no chance this will happen: Hunt has hinted as much. But the leap is assumed in the official forecasts, providing almost half of the chancellor’s £13bn of headroom against his fiscal rules. Elsewhere, Sunak has promised to increase defence spending from 2% of GDP to 2.5% in the long term, without saying how the numbers add up. Doing so by the late 2020s would cost more than £16bn a year. Could this be stripped from the Tory manifesto without an almighty row? Don’t bet on it. The same goes for a “temporary” cut to overseas aid from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. A Sunak move during the Covid pandemic, it threatened to tear the Tories apart. Hunt, as a backbencher, voted against the government on the issue. Now, as chancellor, he says the £6bn cost of restoring the policy will not happen within five years. But it remains Tory policy to pretend the day will come. Making sweeping tax cuts the centrepiece of his election campaign would almost certainly mean Sunak standing on a platform of deeper cuts to public spending than already planned, unless debt levels are to be ratcheted ever higher. It’s a reality Sunak is increasingly comfortable with in rightwing circles. But so far he has faced too few tough questions about the reality of his plans. As with Truss and Kwarteng before him, Sunak could argue tax cuts help grow the economy – bringing in more revenue in future. While some targeted measures may help in the short term, this clearly is not his primary aim: winning votes is the yardstick, not economic progress. Meanwhile, the danger is that any short-run benefits from tax cuts would be outweighed by the lasting damage caused by hacking back the state further. It is clear that record NHS waiting lists, crumbling schools, poverty and ill-health are holding back Britain’s economic potential. And as growing numbers of economists agree, beefed-up public investment can help to “crowd in” the private sector as a more powerful route to prosperity. Taxation can be a roadblock to growth but the biggest problem facing the British economy is its lack of investment – the consequence of austerity and subdued levels of businesses investment after Brexit and years of Tory flip-flopping and psychodrama in Westminster. Investment is viewed by economists as vital for supporting productivity growth, which would have a big benefit for the exchequer. Failure, though, would come with a serious cost. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, getting productivity growth back to its pre-2008 levels would cut government borrowing by £46bn a year in 2028-29, while growth falling back to the levels seen over the past 15 years would increase it by about £40bn. Investment of the kind promoted by Labour is not the radical and dangerous economic plan it is painted out to be. Offering voters bribes on their tax bills while being dishonest about the consequences ought to get a tougher ride."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-07T11:00:19+00:00",
        "content": "For more than a century, the steelworkers of Port Talbot have poured molten metal: it has been the lifeblood flowing through the heart of their coastal south Wales town. Rising between Swansea Bay and the heather-clad hills of west Glamorgan, the plant’s steaming chimney stacks have shaped not just the skyline but the history, economics and even culture of the community. “People’s fathers and grandfathers are steelworkers,” says Gavin John, who owns Afan Ales, a craft beer shop in the town centre. “It’s ingrained in you from a young age: once you’re older you can get a job at the steelworks and you’re made.” Many of his regulars work at the steelworks or one of its suppliers, or have family who do. The plant, which employs more than 4,000 people in a town of about 32,000, is emblematic not just of the community but of the entire steel sector, and even of the vestiges of UK industrial prowess. Trade unions and industry figures say this year is shaping up to be a crunch one for Port Talbot and for British steel, a “crossroads” from which the sector will either limp on in managed decline or thrive anew.   Over the past 40 years, the once-great UK steel industry has been reduced to a shadow of its former self  Sharon Graham, Unite    Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union, is about to present the government with a £12bn plan that it says can ensure a phoenix-like renaissance. The blueprint, a summary of which was shared with the Observer, is a response to several perceived threats. Indian giant Tata Steel, which has owned the site since 2007, is expected to announce plans to mothball its blast furnaces for four years while it builds a greener, cheaper electric alternative. In November, Tata postponed official confirmation of the closures, which unions say could cost 2,500 jobs directly, and hundreds more in the wider community. But industry sources believe the stay of execution was temporary, with the axe falling early this year. This would be controversial given that Tata’s plan involves £500m of taxpayer subsidy. In Scunthorpe, the UK’s only other blast furnace site, a similar £1.25bn plan is raising questions over the future of about 2,000 workers. That plant’s owner, Chinese firm Jingye, rescued British Steel in 2020, promising a “new chapter” in UK steelmaking. It, too is expected to ask for £500m in government support. Both Jingye and Tata want to build electric arc furnaces, which offer the ability to recycle scrap steel using clean electricity. Blast furnaces rely on coking coal, which emits large amounts of carbon. In the meantime, Britain would be the only major economy in Europe and the G20 with no ability to make steel from scratch in a blast furnace, relying instead on imported steel for the aerospace and automotive sectors and to make hundreds of miles of railway track. Unite believes the eco-friendly switch can be made without devastating communities through job cuts, or letting the blast furnaces go cold. “Over the past 40 years, the once-great UK steel industry has been reduced to a shadow of its former self,” says Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. “The transition to green, low-carbon steel is a golden opportunity to reverse those decades of managed decline.” The union quotes a report by McKinsey which estimates that global demand for green steel will rise tenfold by 2030, to 200m tonnes. Graham says: “We know we will be using more steel – especially more green steel – in the UK over the next decade. The question is, where will it be made?” Under Unite’s proposals, the government would invest £12bn over 12 years to spur a steel renaissance which, it says, would pay for itself in 10 years via increased tax receipts. Its plan would keep the blast furnaces open during a transition to fully decarbonised steelmaking involving electric arc furnaces and direct reduced iron furnaces (DRIs). DRIs can use green hydrogen – extracted from water using renewable energy – rather than gas, to make virgin steel. Fellow steelworker unions the GMB and Community have previously put DRIs and electric arc furnaces at the heart of their own plan to save jobs at Port Talbot, a proposal that would keep a blast furnace running until 2032. But Unite’s plan is broader and, crucially, proposes a 40% subsidy for the crippling energy costs that have made UK steelmaking an exercise in burning money in recent years. British manufacturers pay 86% more for their energy than competitors in Germany and 62% more than in France, and charges for connection to the National Grid are particularly high. The move to green steel will require even greater electricity usage, says Unite, so industry must be prioritised for upgraded connections to the grid.  Interactive  The union would also like to see procurement rules changed, with a “Buy British” clause offering financial incentives to encourage the purchase of UK-made steel. The government has already announced plans for a carbon tax on imported steel from 2027, but Unite is backing calls from industry body UK Steel to bring this forward to 2026, in line with European Union plans. All of this, says Unite, could double UK steel output, which has declined since 1971 from 25m tonnes to about 6m tonnes. The decline has meant a fall in jobs too, from more than 250,000 to just under 34,000. It is not just direct employment that suffers when a steelworks goes cold. Cafes that feed hungry workers, pubs that slake their thirst, suppliers, contractors and local shops all have a stake in what happens next, not just in Port Talbot but in the great steelmaking centres of Scunthorpe and Sheffield – not to mention Teesside, which is still holding out hope of a revival. These communities are summoning their strength to fight for an industry that has been in a long-term downward spiral. In Port Talbot, supporters of Unite’s campaign range from the local mosque to the local football club and karate association. In Scunthorpe and Sheffield, backers include knitting clubs, boxing gyms, Methodist churches and a tattoo parlour. Unite has been quick to point out that these organisations account for many thousands of voters. In Port Talbot that may not worry the government too much, given that Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has a majority of more than 10,000. But in Scunthorpe, Tory Holly Mumby-Croft, who rarely fails to mention that she is the granddaughter of a steelworker, has an overturnable majority of 6,451. In Redcar, Teesside, where British Steel wants to build an electric arc furnace, Tory Jacob Young’s majority is even slimmer, at 3,527.   Related: Unions tell Tata Steel UK steelmaking is at risk if blast furnaces closed   Back at Afan Ales, Gavin John thinks the government hasn’t grasped the opportunities of investing in green steel: “Everyone here stands together but one of the biggest things for us is that politicians seem to be sitting on the fence. The money they’ve put in is all right, but it’s managed decline.” Voters and trade unions are watching developments closely, as is UK Steel. “The sector is ready to deliver, in a committed partnership with government, and transform how the UK makes steel,” says its director general, Gareth Stace.

        "content": "One day in January 1985 I was staying in my usual Paris hotel, writing an article about the French economy and due to interview the finance minister that morning. He stood me up, but with good reason. The telephone rang and his assistant said Monsieur Delors had just resigned from the treasury and was off to Brussels to become president of the European Commission. I hesitate to use a dreadful ­cliche, but I shall: the rest is history. Delors formed an alliance with Margaret Thatcher which led to the ­creation of the single market, with Thatcher’s nominee Arthur (later Lord) Cockfield playing a leading role in its formation. Thatcher and Delors later fell out over the latter’s plans for closer political ties, European monetary union and the single currency; but no less a former colleague than Kenneth Clarke regarded Thatcher’s role in the formation of the single market as her finest achievement. At the time, the Labour party was predominantly Eurosceptical. But Delors played a crucial role in winning it around with a truly historic speech to the TUC annual conference in 1988, not least with his assurance that there would be a “social dimension” to the single market. It was not, as the lunatic fringe of the left imagined, some “capitalist plot”, but an engine of economic growth and closer political and social cooperation. So it proved to be – so much so that Keir Starmer, not widely seen as a man of passion, was the embodiment of passion in arguing after that dreadful referendum of 2016 that there should be a second one, in the hope that the decision to leave the EU could be reversed. It never happened – or, I should rather say, it has not happened yet. Instead, it was Starmer’s position on rejoining the EU that was reversed. Indeed, I have lost count of the number of occasions on which the leader of the opposition and his shadow chancellor have ruled out rejoining the single market if – or when – they are elected. Not to put too fine a point on it, Labour is frightened of offending those erstwhile Labour voters who, often misled by the Leave campaign’s shamelessly mendacious propaganda, became part of the group known as the “red wall”.   Even the ostensibly Eurosceptical Viktor Orbán, prime minister of Hungary, knows which side his bread is buttered   The received view among the Labour hierarchy is that it would be too risky to fight an election promising to rejoin the EU. Instead, we get a lot of well-intentioned guff about closer cooperation. This is in spite of the way the country at large has woken up to how it was swindled by Brexit and sees the consequent damage on many fronts. As my colleague Toby Helm reported last week, a poll suggests the British public “now regards Brexit as a failure … just 22% of voters think it has been good for the UK in general”. That two of the main players in Brexit – David Cameron and Boris Johnson – went to Eton has given rise to savage criticism about the damage wreaked by “elites”. In his memoir Among Others, the author and playwright Michael Frayn recalls some of the great products of that school and laments “how many of the Old Etonians who are nowadays prominent in political and business life seem to be charlatans, thieves and liars”, unlike predecessors who were “all, genuinely, deeply good people”. Frayn is a great satirist, as is Tom Stoppard. But I doubt whether either of them could have thought up the line recently coined by a Brexiter minister, one Kevin Hollinrake, when referring to the putative appearance of the pint-sized wine bottle: “Our exit from the EU was all about moments just like this.” The benefits of Brexit! Pint-sized, and probably not needed anyway. So there you are, dear reader. What Nigel Farage – with his all too successful campaign to blackmail Cameron into calling a referendum – and Johnson and Co have brought us is a pint-sized Brexit wreaking huge damage to our export trade and budgetary position, which latter will severely inhibit a Labour government’s freedom of manoeuvre to spend the money the party pretends it does not want to spend. We now have the Tories promising tax cuts when the prospects for public services are dire. Do they ever listen to that voice of sanity Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies? After a decade of austerity, the IFS foresees more, and argues that the last thing the economy needs is a preference for tax cuts as opposed to much-needed increases in spending. It is absolutely vital that this country should own up to its historic error over Brexit. Why, even the ostensibly Eurosceptical Viktor Orbán, prime minister of Hungary, knows which side his bread is buttered. Whatever else he is up to, he does not wish to follow the UK’s self-harming example of leaving that great institution, the single market – brainchild of Delors and, er, Thatcher."

He must respond by Tuesday to a series of testy questions from Liam Byrne MP, the chair of the parliamentary business and trade committee, on Royal Mail’s staff turn­over, poor service and disputed parcels policy. This is the latest tussle in the troubled history of the 507-year-old company – seen by some as a venerable institution and by others as a corporate conundrum – which faces a huge challenge to reinvent itself amid stiff competition. More than a dozen current and former employees and directors who have spoken to the Observer describe an organisation in flux, wrestling with questions over unions and regulators, workplace culture, changing consumer habits and a decline in letter volumes. Change at the top A tumultuous few years for the group have been reflected in the pace of arrivals and departures in the boardroom. Royal Mail is the largest but most problematic part of International Distributions Services (IDS), the recently rebranded group which also contains General Logistics Systems (GLS) and Parcelforce. GLS is the profitable international arm, delivering parcels in 40 countries, mainly in Europe and North America. Seidenberg, who runs IDS, will be keen to draw a line under a rocky period which has included a flurry of chief executives, damaging strike action over pay and conditions, a corporate rebrand, threats of administration, a £67m ransom demand after a cyber-attack, and a £5.6m fine from the regulator for failing to hit delivery targets. He even tried to address the latter by offering bonuses of up to £500 for postal workers to hit Christmas targets, as he hired 16,000 seasonal temps. (This target was split, with £250 of it linked to national targets which were missed.) The departure of former Ocado executive Simon Thompson last year left Royal Mail hunting for its fourth boss in four years. Chided as “clueless” by MPs, mocked by the children of his workers and chanted about by thousands of angry postal staff in Westminster, Thompson was the latest chief to leave what may be the most impossible job on the FTSE, after two years at the helm. He announced his resignation in May but officially remained with the company until October. He is due a payoff of up to £700,000. Despite the lingering goodbye, Seidenberg – formerly head of Amsterdam-based GLS – said he did not meet Thompson after taking charge in August. Thompson’s predecessor, Rico Back, later said Thompson’s lack of experience in running either a big company or a logistics business had been a “toxic mixture”. Back himself abruptly resigned after less than two years, following a tussle with the Communication Workers Union. He was nicknamed the “flying postman” for running the business from his £2.3m family home overlooking Lake Zurich. Seidenberg said he was taking “full ownership of Royal Mail on an interim basis as we just can’t wait [around]”. It is understood headhunters at Russell Reynolds have been tasked with finding a permanent chief executive, while pressure is mounting on the chair, Keith Williams, to ensure the next boss is the right one. “Keith hired Rico and that went badly; Simon too. His judgment has to be questioned,” says one former director.  Growing losses The scale of Seidenberg’s task was laid bare in his City debut. Group revenues were flat, at £5.8bn, in the first half of its financial year, while profits in GLS were more than offset by a 46% increase in losses at Royal Mail, to £319m, according to results published in November. Group operating losses widened to £169m, from a £57m loss in the same period a year earlier, and Seidenberg vowed to get a “grip” on quality of service, to set “the foundation for growth”.  Interactive  Competition to land lucrative parcel contracts remains stiff even as a pandemic-fuelled boom subsides. This was underlined in November, when the Post Office signed deals with rivals Evri and DPD to allow them to deliver some parcels sent from its branches, amid concerns over reliability of the service. Royal Mail was legally separated from the Post Office – the state-owned private company that operates 11,500 branches, and which has been embroiled in the Horizon IT scandal – in 2012, before the former’s flotation. The November contract ended Royal Mail’s 360-year-old monopoly on the service. Meanwhile, e-commerce parcel volumes fell across the sector in 2023, the drop blamed partly on fashion retailers clamping down on returns and partly on rising delivery charges. At Royal Mail, volumes were down in the first half of the year, before recovering some ground. Delivery difficulties Royal Mail’s long-term future will be significantly shaped by the postal and communications regulator, Ofcom. In September, it began examining options to alter the universal service obligation (USO) – the stipulation that Royal Mail has to deliver to every address in Great Britain six days a week, at a fixed price. Royal Mail has blamed the USO for rising stamp prices and last summer the government denied its request to stop delivering post on Saturdays – a move which would have needed approval by MPs. Ofcom has previously said the move could save £125m to £225m a year. The shape of any reforms to the USO have been debated for years. Before the pandemic, consultants at McKinsey were enlisted by Royal Mail to aid this work, coming up with no fewer than 23 models. Their research found dropping Saturdays would require minimal change within the organisation, an insider says. The biggest indicator of the long-term strategy may come from Royal Mail’s recent moves with its bulk mail customers. These companies, which include UKMail, Whistl and Citipost, specialise in sorting and processing mail for big businesses – typically marketing letters or household bills to consumers. These bulk letters, which are taken on the “final mile” by Royal Mail, make up the majority of all letters sent, though volumes here are also in decline as companies favour email or social media to reach customers.  Interactive  Under most bulk mail contracts, Royal Mail is required to deliver the next day and, as with consumer mail, the quality of service has fallen behind targets. However, since 2020, bulk customers have been also able to select a slower, three-day delivery option. Sources believe this cutting back on business mail could offer a blueprint for reducing consumer deliveries. Ofcom has conducted analysis on how cutting back on delivery days would affect households, with particular emphasis on the implications for vulnerable mail users. Sources familiar with Ofcom’s work say analysis presented in the autumn had found that 97% of residential customers and small to medium-sized businesses would suffer “minimal” impact from a switch to a Monday-to-Friday schedule, with publishers of magazines likely to be the most affected among bulk customers. The research also showed that about 80% of residential users and between 60% and 80% of small businesses would be served adequately by a three-day-a-week service, or alternate-day deliveries. “People think this is about going from six days to five but it’s more about going from five days to three,” says a former employee who has examined the options. “Saturday is a red herring: they need something more radical.” However, cutting the frequency of bulk deliveries may not significantly reduce costs. Although this work is not regulated under the USO, it is reliant on the same network of postal workers, making the two services hard to disentangle. The source adds that to cut costs significantly using the alternate-days plan, thousands of jobs would need to be cut, with posties then tasked with walking two different routes on alternate days. “The main issue may be that its small parcels business is entirely reliant on its letters network, so if you cut back on deliveries, you have to put small packages in vans, which is less efficient,” the source says. Ofcom was expected to give an update on its work on the shape of the future of the postal service in December, but has delayed this to later in January. “The need for reform is urgent. The UK is getting left behind – most comparable countries have already reformed their universal service,” says a Royal Mail spokesperson. In a separate move, it is understood that B2B International, a market research company, recently carried out a work on behalf of Royal Mail’s direct mail arm, MarketReach. The study asked large business customers for their views on delivery frequency, including reducing schedules. Meanwhile, some posties will start their working day up to 90 minutes later from April as part of a cost-cutting drive. Cultural problems Royal Mail’s historical strategy of offering lucrative overtime to get deliveries done appears to be encountering problems – the number of rounds (or walks) done by posties on overtime has fallen sharply since the pandemic. “Older workers don’t want to do the walks, but the business model assumes a certain amount of overtime,” says a source. “The problem is the workforce is skewed older and they don’t necessarily want to take the overtime. If posties are delivering fewer letters over greater distances, it may not appeal physically.” Another longstanding problem appears to be workplace culture. Several sources claim managers show favouritism, giving certain colleagues the best rounds, and allege that problems with bullying remain. The issue of bullying has also been raised in the past by several bosses, including Thompson. Christopher Davies, who lives in Essex, resigned in 2022 after 32 years with the business, following seven months signed off with stress related to bullying. He claims Royal Mail had a “disgusting culture of bullying which runs through the organisation”.  Davies accuses his managers of bullying him when he returned to work after the death of his infant grandson in 2019. “It’s shocking how I was treated, and bullying happens right across Royal Mail,” the former postman says. “Managers bullied the staff and gave the best shifts and the overtime to their mates.”  Royal Mail says it has a “zero-tolerance approach to bullying, harassment, or discrimination of any kind”. Also, long-running tensions have resurfaced over whether there has been a push to prioritise delivering more lucrative parcels over letters. Last year, MPs received photographs and recordings of local managers giving instructions to prioritise parcels, but Ofcom later said it “did not identify any suggestion that Royal Mail’s senior management had directed the prioritisation of parcels over letters”.  A union source says: “That was a red rag to a bull for the workforce – they know it’s the case.” Royal Mail says it may be “logistically necessary to clear parcels first” to make space in delivery offices, but that Ofcom had not found “any suggestion” that senior management were instructing packages be prioritised “outside of recognised contingency plans”. Activist investors Royal Mail’s attempts to change under private ownership are comparable to struggles at BT and British Gas, both privatised under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. At each company, successive bosses have demanded rapid change of their huge workforces in evolving markets, while grappling with ageing infrastructure. But while Thatcher eschewed privatising Royal Mail – even the Iron Lady was “not prepared to have the Queen’s head privatised”, she said – it was listed in 2013 amid a cloud of controversy. Fleet-footed and less hamstrung rivals have spurred its modernisation efforts, such as introducing barcoded stamps to aid tracking, using drones to deliver to islands, offering Sunday parcel deliveries, installing Amazon-style collection lockers and opening “super hubs” for parcel processing in Cheshire and Northamptonshire. The company says it is making “good progress” in implementing changes to working hours and attendance policies that were agreed to end the strikes. A notable uncertainty in the background is the intentions of Daniel Křetínský, the billionaire who first invested in 2020 and is now IDS’s largest shareholder. The tycoon, nicknamed the Czech Sphinx for his poker-faced approach to investment, faced a national security investigation last year when his firm, Vesa, raised its stake. No action was taken. Křetínský’s investment initially did well, bringing in a share of a £400m dividend in 2021 as the pandemic boosted deliveries. But the shares have since more than halved in value, to 270p. Shareholders have, however, been promised a “modest dividend”, paid from GLS profits, this year.  It was initially suggested that Křetínský would push for a breakup of the group – an idea later mooted by the company itself in a threat to the union – but Křetínský has since said this is not his intention. He declined to comment for this article.  Royal Mail could also be caught in political turbulence this year, if Labour wins a general election.  “I would like as much parliamentary scrutiny as possible for the new management,” says Kate Osborne, the Labour MP for Jarrow, who worked at Royal Mail for 25 years before entering Parliament. She campaigned against privatisation and would like to see Royal Mail renationalised. However, she says Labour’s frontbench has not stated its desire to see this happen. “There is still an ‘us and them’ culture at Royal Mail between the workers or middle management and the leaders,” Osborne says. “They still get their big bonuses when Royal Mail fall foul of their targets but those lower down do not get their bonuses. The shareholders keep getting their dividends.”"

        "content": "A former post office operator who led a campaign to fight against wrongful convictions brought by the Post Office has called for compensation for the victims to be sped up after the broadcast of an ITV drama about the scandal. The Metropolitan police confirmed on Friday the Post Office was under criminal investigation over “potential fraud offences” committed during the Horizon scandal. Fifty new potential victims have contacted lawyers since the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was broadcast, including five who wish to appeal against their convictions. Neil Hudgell, a lawyer who has already helped 73 former operators with convictions related to the scandal, said the numbers were increasing all the time. He said the number of people who have come forward was now in excess of 60. He also said there had been a significant increase in the number of children coming forward on behalf of deceased parents. As of Saturday evening, a petition to strip former Post Office boss Paula Vennells of her CBE had surpassed its original target of 800,000 signatures and had been upped to a goal of 900,000. Vennells was the chief executive for much of the period during which the postmasters were wrongly pursued. Alan Bates told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that the four-part drama had helped reignite the issue, and that he hoped this could speed up the compensation process for victims. “I think it’s made a huge difference to the campaign,” he said. “It’s really ignited the whole issue again, and hopefully we can try and bring some conclusion to some of the issues that are still outstanding now.” The show documents the miscarriage of justice in which more than 700 post office branch managers wrongly received criminal convictions, including for theft, false accounting and fraud, after faulty Horizon accounting software made it appear as though money was missing from their outlets. It has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history and a public inquiry into it is under way. Asked why victims might not have come forward before the drama, Bates said: “I think there may well be people who just did not know what had been going on over the years of campaigning. “But I also think some people will take support from the fact of so many of the victims standing up and being identified, and I think that’s probably helped people give them the confidence to come forward.” Hudgell said it had been a “privilege to look after so many decent, hard-working and honest people, who are the heartbeat of this country. It’s why we are lawyers, helping make a difference. But they are the true heroes of all this.” Under the terms of their contracts, operators such as Bates, who ran a post office in the seaside town of Llandudno, north Wales, were liable for the financial losses and the Post Office demanded they repay the money or face closure, prosecution or a civil claim.   Related: Post Office almost halves amount set aside for Horizon IT scandal compensation   Hundreds were jailed or left bankrupt, lost their homes, and at least four people killed themselves. Bates claimed at least 60 people had died waiting for compensation. Lee Castleton, a formerpost office operator from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, said his family’s lives were “torn apart” by the ordeal. Castleton was pursued by the Post Office for the repayment of £25,000 in alleged discrepancies arising from the faulty Horizon software, and his failed legal action to challenge the debt led to £300,000 costs and bankruptcy. He told Times Radio: “We were ostracised in Bridlington. We were abused in the streets. Our daughter was bullied. She was on the school bus and spat on by a young boy because [they thought] her father was a thief, and he’d take money from old people.” Hudgell, the executive chair of Hudgell Solicitors, told the PA Media news agency his clients welcomed the news of the Met investigation. “The drama has elevated public awareness to a whole new level. The British public and their overwhelming sympathy for the plight of these poor people has given some the strength to finally come forward. “Those numbers increase by the day, but there are so many more out there. We had 50 up to yesterday and approaching another 20 today.” Bates said it had been “an excellent vehicle to get the message out there”. “I think the big hold-up now is for what they call the compensation, or the financial redress … What they need to do is speed the bureaucracy up, which is holding up the payments to all of these people. They really must light a fire under their officials to get this sorted.” The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, told BBC Breakfast the government would do “everything they can” to speed up compensation for operators who were still waiting. “We want to do this as fast as possible,” he said. “So we hear that message loud and clear, we will look into doing everything we can to speed up the payment of compensation.” PA Media contributed to this report"

        "content": "You may barely have packed away your Christmas decorations, but for retailers the final reckoning of the festive season is just getting into gear, with a string of major chains reporting on trading this week. We will find out who enjoyed jingle tills and where the rancid turkeys lie as Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Greggs and B&M all reveal their figures. Those retailers that kept news of poor trading under wraps last week, in hopes of a last-minute blast by January sales shoppers, may finally have to admit their failings in some unscheduled announcements. So how are things looking? For clothing retailers it has been a mixed picture, with Next becoming the top riser in the FTSE 100 on Thursday as it revealed yet another profits upgrade thanks to better than expected trading. On the same day, JD Sports Fashion became the biggest FTSE faller after it issued a profits warning. Next put its success down to strong online sales, helped by improvements in its distribution network and recovery from last year’s Royal Mail strikes, which had affected home deliveries. JD, in contrast, blamed high discounting and the mild weather for disappointing sales.   Related: Too mild for fleeces? There’s more than that to JD Sports’ profit warning | Nils Pratley   The news from M&S may shed more light on whether this was a case of Next outperforming a tough market or if JD and the sportswear sector are suffering more than others. JD’s young consumers had been buoyed by wage increases, good work availability and lack of exposure to the mortgage increases and energy bills their parents have been dealing with, but perhaps they have chosen to prioritise holidays or technology over clobber this season. M&S was among the top FTSE risers in the new year as investors bet on it having had a decent Christmas, with improved affordability on foods and better style in its clothing ranges both looking to have paid off. Like Next, it is also likely to have benefited from its mix of shops and a slick online presence, which gives shoppers the reassurance – and potential cost savings – of opting to click and collect items from stores rather than have them delivered. With more spare cash to start with, M&S’s core customers are seen as somewhat insulated from cost of living increases and are therefore potentially less likely to be put off by higher prices.  Certainly, M&S’s online discounts of up to 50% are far lower than the dramatic 80% seen at Boohoo and Asos, or 70% at Superdry and Sports Direct, which suggest tougher times elsewhere in the fashion market. M&S’s increased presence in the beauty market is also likely to have been good for business, as strong sales figures from Boots last week reinforced hopes of a good season for face creams and cosmetics, perhaps benefiting from a return to socialising and spending on cheap treats. M&S, which reports on Christmas trading on Thursday along with Tesco, is also seen as a likely winner on food. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, predicts that M&S food could deliver sales growth of more than 10% as its combination of “Remarksable” value lines and innovative ideas draws in shoppers. Listed supermarkets Sainsbury’s and Tesco also look to have fared better than their private-equity-owned rivals Asda and Morrisons. Both increased their market share over Christmas compared with a year earlier, with Sainsbury’s looking to be the strongest performer of the traditional supermarkets, according to data released last week by industry analysts Kantar.   Related: Sainsbury’s boss defends decision to sell customers’ Nectar card data   Both Tesco and Sainsbury’s – which reports on Wednesday – are likely to face questions, however, on the costs and impact of their heavy investments in loyalty card discounts, which are currently being investigated by the competition watchdog. Such tactics seem to have protected the UK’s two biggest grocery chains from losing shoppers to Aldi and Lidl, but could in the long term lose them the sort of drop-in shoppers who are not keen to sign up to a complicated loyalty scheme just to get a decently priced pint of milk. Also snapping at their heels is discounter B&M, another big riser as investors returned to business after the festive break. It reports on Tuesday, and is likely to have benefited from the demise of rival Wilko in the final weeks of the year."

        "content": "Company insolvencies soared last year as businesses struggled with the inflation crisis and the long-term impact of the Covid pandemic, new figures show. A total of 30,199 UK businesses were involved in some kind of insolvency action in 2023 – 52% higher than in 2021, according to Creditsafe, a credit checking agency which tracks 430m businesses around the world. Some of those insolvencies are likely to have been companies which would have failed earlier but were kept afloat by government help during the pandemic, according to Drew Fahiya, Creditsafe’s data director. “For the companies that were doing well, Covid really hurt them, but for the ones that were struggling anyway, it probably gave them a bit of breathing space to get them back where they needed to be,” he said. Others are businesses which where thriving until Covid. The Prop Factory had been turning over £800,000 a year and employing 15 people to make and hire out vintage games such as coconut shies and duck-shoot galleries for corporate events. “We did Facebook’s Christmas party in Dublin, we’ve worked for Google, we did Renault Formula One’s Christmas party,” said Carmen Croxall, the co-founder. That ground to a halt when the pandemic hit, and in spite of a boost in 2022, when there was a mini-boom due to pent-up demand from customers keen to hold a celebration, they closed the event-hire business just before Christmas. “It never really recovered,” she said. “This year was 46% down – there was a seismic shift in the industry because people have made cutbacks, and we were right at the bottom of the pecking order.” Now they are selling most of their remaining props, but hope is on the horizon – they ran a Christmas SelfieLand event last year where 6,000 people paid for the chance to take selfies in front of 20 different backdrops. The venture was inspired by Croxall’s decision to transform her home into a gingerbread house, which went viral, and the SelfieLand profits are helping pay off the remainder of £400,000 of debts the company owes. She plans to open a cafe in their warehouse and create a funfair with their remaining props.Lorna Reeves had a similar experience. “I was the first LGBTQ+ wedding planner in the country,” she said. “We struggled when we got married because there was a lot of ignorance in the wedding industry – it was going well, and then Covid happened.” When restrictions loosened, many clients did not press ahead with earlier plans. “Their lives had moved on, or they had spent a lot of time kicking around so did a lot of planning and research themselves,” she said. “People’s budgets have been smaller. The impacts on society have been so long-lasting it’s like long Covid for business.” She called time on the business last year, and started a new venture, MyOhMy Events, and now employs four people.  Interactive  Claire Hattrick sold her heated couch on new year’s day – the last vestiges of the beauty salon she had run for 17 years. “I was probably earning about £25,000 a year and I had about 80 clients. Suddenly I lost 86% of that during the lockdowns. It just got worse and worse and worse,” she said. “Then we had the price hikes with gas and electricity. I was literally paying for people to come and have a treatment.” Clients aren’t keen on bikini waxes in a cold salon. “I was bringing in maybe £300 a month by the end. We had no support to help us get back on our feet and we’ve just been forgotten about.” Hattrick has pivoted, as the management consultants say, and set up TheExecutiveMenopauseCoach.com with the help of her twin daughters. She is passionate about helping women floored by the menopause. “I’ve now started to get a little bit of money coming in, but if it wasn’t for the girls coming up with the idea and us working our backsides off I would have no money coming in right now.” The question that remains is whether or not insolvencies will return to pre-pandemic levels soon. Creditsafe tracks whether firms are creditworthy by examining banking data and said that in 2023, UK companies paid 45% of all invoices late, up from 35% in 2021 and just over 11 days late, on average. Globally, firms in the US were the slowest to pay, nearly 16 days late on average. So far there are no signs that insolvencies are slowing, according to Stephanie Buckley, who founded the Insolvency Company with her husband Gareth in 2018 and works with businesses that are shutting down. She said 2023 had been a record year for their practice. “We see all sorts of reasons for business failure,” she said. “Grief, baby loss, loss of loved ones, their own health problems – there seem to be a lot more health problems now. “Also people are struggling to recruit. In a lot of industries it is hard to find staff, and that has an impact. And costs have gone up with inflation. Those are the main reasons, but everybody we work with cites Covid and Brexit.” Liz Barclay, the small business commissioner, said that firms had been hit in 2023 by interest rate rises, inflation, business rates, taxes, debt repayments and skills and labour shortages. “This underlines why it’s vitally important that all big customers pay their suppliers along the supply chain as quickly as possible. Late payments and extended payment terms add to those businesses’ woes and are often the straw that brings vital businesses to their knees. We must make 2024 the year we improve payment practices to help all the firms we deal with pay their bills, play their part in growing the economy and stay solvent.” Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “There’s always a lag between economic troubles and a rise in insolvencies, as businesses throw everything they have at attempts to keep going before having to call it a day. With growth sluggish at best in 2023, we may well see an impact on small firms’ finances this year, even if the economic outlook improves.”"

        "content": "On a drizzly morning Luton’s takeaways are preparing for the lunchtime rush. McDonald’s is busy with shoppers, while chains from Subway to German Doner Kebab are opening their doors for the approaching army of hungry stomachs. The Bedfordshire town is one of the UK’s worst spots for obesity, with one hospital admission linked to weight for every 20 residents in 2022. That toll is more than 10 times the rate in Bracknell Forest, Berkshire, according to NHS data. The local council is testing ways to tackle the problem: blocking takeaways from opening near schools, banning adverts for unhealthy foods from council-run hoardings, giving families advice on health and nutrition, and trying to encourage walking and cycling. But a new weapon could soon be in the armoury – one that could have big implications for the food industry and the battle against obesity. Weight loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic for diabetes, are already available on the NHS, and Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, which has been approved for weight loss and, sold as Zepbound, is expected to be available in the UK soon. The drugs have been lauded by celebrities and the super rich who boast about buying the jabs to keep their waists in trim. The Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk’s value has swollen so much amid the weight loss drug boom that it is dominating, and even distorting, Denmark’s economy. But could they really help towns such as Luton become healthier – and what will that mean for the food industry? The global obesity crisis Worldwide, more than a billion people are obese and many more are overweight. On current trends, more than half of the world’s population – 4 billion people – will be overweight or obese by 2035. In the UK, a quarter of people live with obesity and 38% are overweight. The new generation of weight loss drugs is being hailed as a solution to the obesity crisis, at least in part. The prospect of thousands of people using the appetite-suppressing drugs has spooked fast-food chains and sellers of sugary food and drinks, triggering a sell off of share prices across the food sector. The McDonald’s share price, for example, fell by 17% between the end of June and mid-October, wiping almost $38bn (£30bn) off its market value, but has since recovered. While the drugs are expensive and it is not clear how many people will take them, food companies know they will have to adapt. Western lifestyles – unhealthy diets featuring highly processed foods rich in saturated fats, refined sugar and preservatives, and a decline in physical exercise – have spread to other parts of the world. More than half of the adult population in India has abdominal obesity (genetically, Asian people tend to store more fat around the abdomen). According to the World Health Organization’s definition, adults with a body mass index (BMI) from 25 to 30 are classed as overweight and those with a BMI of 30 or more as obese.  Interactive  How the new weight loss drugs work The craze for these therapies means their makers, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, are struggling to keep up with demand. The treatments are injected once a week with a pen device, into the stomach, thigh or upper arm, and mimic the action of a gut hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). When blood sugar levels start to rise after someone eats, the shots prompt the body to produce more insulin, to lower blood sugar levels. This helps control type 2 diabetes, but also helps curb hunger. The drugs suppress appetite and slow the movement of food through the digestive system, so people feel full faster and for longer, and eat less. While the drugs have helped people lose substantial amounts of weight, potential side effects range from nausea, bloating, diarrhoea and fatigue, to more serious stomach, kidney and gallbladder problems and inflammation of the pancreas. The two companies are also racing to come up with weight loss pills. Their US rival Pfizer suffered a severe setback with its pill in early December and abandoned trials of the twice-daily version after more than half of participants stopped taking it because of the side effects – nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The US firm still plans to release data on its once-daily version of the pill. The pharma companies have been criticised for the high cost of the new medicines. In the US, the list prices for Wegovy and Mounjaro are more than $1,000 a month, and many insurers only cover diabetes but not weight loss.  Interactive    They’re not a silver bullet. What they do is they treat obesity very effectively, but they don’t treat the food environment which has led to and driven obesity in the first place.  Matthew Hudson, Luton borough council    John Lathrop and Tory Novakova, US analysts at the French asset manager Amundi, expect a “broad update” of the new therapies, with about 105 million people in the US and 45 million in Europe (Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain) eligible for them. By the end of the decade, they forecast $80bn annual spending on these drugs. Rebecca Tobi, the senior business and investor manager at the Food Foundation, a UK charity, says: “These drugs will be hugely useful for some people, but we need to see them as treatment and not prevention. The food industry For now, food bosses appear sanguine about how big the impact will be. The Walmart US chief executive, John Furner, said recently that people taking the drugs were buying less food: “Just less units, slightly less calories.” Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate consumption of fizzy soft drinks, baked goods and salty snacks in the US could fall by up to 3% by 2035. They estimate that 24 million people, or 7% of the US population, will be taking the new GLP-1 drugs by 2035. A survey carried out of 300 patients taking the shots showed they ate less and cut back the most on foods high in sugar and fat. About 90% of those using the drugs said their snacking declined and 77% said they visited fast-casual restaurants less often. Tobi says: “If people eat less, that is a threat to how a lot of large food business systems are set up in that they make a profit, the greater volumes of food they sell.” However, food industry bosses are not anticipating a big impact on sales as they bet that take-up of the drugs will remain relatively low and users will continue buying their favourite brands – just in smaller portions. “We’re seeing no impact today with GLP-1s and GLP-2, nobody has any idea what the impact is going to be in the future,” McDonald’s boss Chris Kempczinski told Yahoo Finance recently. Cadbury’s owner Mondelēz says that over the next 10 years it expects weight control jabs to hit sales volumes by no more than 1% globally but has yet to see any impact on its business. “Most of the food grocery companies came out with a low single-digit impact,” says Novakova at Amundi. “And these companies are well aware of these risks and will be able to adapt if necessary.” That could be through reducing portion sizes, or using healthier ingredients. Mondelēz says the company is “well positioned to help consumers snack more mindfully”. “We feel the impact has been a little overblown recently, and it’s important to put it into perspective.” Rick Miller, the associate director of food and drink research at Mintel, says: “I don’t think it is going to be the wild dramatic impact being suggested by some.” Miller says it is unclear if the drugs will stand the test of time or fade out like previous drugs, “which were shown not to be effective in the long term”. The need to inject the drugs and the expense are also seen as offputting to all but those most in need of weight control. Even if the jabs are widely taken up in the long term, “people might eat less but better quality”, Miller says. “Some brands have already made that repositioning in the face of reduction in portion size targets in the UK.” Another possible line is “fortification food” – drinks or snacks that have added vitamins and minerals to help people meet daily nutritional requirements while eating less. Miller adds: “Something smaller but has got everything you need.” That idea is supported by Nestlé which says: “We are already working on a wide number of products that could serve as a very helpful companions during the course of the treatment involving weight loss drugs.” The Swiss food company highlighted its high-protein products such as Optifast and Vital Protein that help preserve lean body mass during weight loss, and multivitamin supplements such as Nature’s Bounty to fill nutritional gaps with reduced-calorie intake. Another big UK food retailer says it has yet to begin working on a response to the diet jabs as the perceived market is far too small, as a mix of shortages in the UK and restricted access via the NHS keep a lid on usage. A source there says it would be simple to adapt food ranges should the drugs become popular. “We could just do half portions [on ready meals]. Every bite has got to count and engage your senses. It has got to pack a punch.” Some brands and product categories will be harder hit than others. Jennifer Creevy, the director of food and drink at the trends agency WGSN, says: “Consumers will always want treats but will be looking for tasty and healthy versions. Businesses that have healthy, better-for-you alternatives among their portfolios and invest even further here will win.” She suggests companies will begin to produce “companion products that support consumers after they stop taking these medications to ensure they don’t regain weight” – “complete nutrition products designed to keep you fuller for longer”. Analysts at Goldman Sachs looked at sales data which suggested women in their mid-40s to mid-50s were the most likely users of weight loss drugs. They found that these women were not cutting back on chocolate or alcohol as much as might be expected but were buying more beauty products and switching to smaller treats such as mini muffins so that overall food consumption was down – except chocolate. What investors think To figure out the impact of the new drugs, Moritz Dullinger, a fund manager at Pictet Asset Management in Zurich, has been scanning company statements and transcripts of earnings calls with the help of artificial intelligence, and trawling through message boards manually to look at real-life feedback from patients. “What some people underestimate is that in 10 years, the first GLP-1 drugs will be off-patent,” he says. This will enable generic drugmakers to produce much cheaper versions. “So then we will have less of a price discussion and people who tolerate the drugs well can stay on them. And this will have a big impact on our society.” Obesity drugs could become a lifestyle choice, he and others say – for example, if someone wants to lose 10kg for a family wedding they could use a GLP-1 drug temporarily to suppress their appetite. But a lot rides on whether the drugs will be available as pills one day. Paul Major, director at another big investor, Bellevue Asset Management, is sceptical. “This idea that you can’t be a shareholder in Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks or Diageo is a bit fanciful. Nobody knows how long anyone’s gonna stay on these drugs. What the data shows is if you come off these drugs cold turkey, your appetite will come roaring back … The vast majority of people are not going to take these drugs.” On the ground In Luton, most of those visiting the takeaways forlunch agree that they are not likely to follow in the footsteps of celebrities such as Sharon Osbourne, Amy Schumer and Oprah Winfrey and give the jabs a try. Bev Lewis, 55, says: “I wouldn’t go there. You wouldn’t know what’s in it. I would rather use honey and lemon or something natural.” Lewis says she is more likely to “boil up herbs” from her Caribbean family homeland and eat home-cooked food. “Everyone in my household is on the same wavelength.” Nkechi, 40, who eats takeaways once or twice a month, agrees. “I don’t believe in that way of doing things and they will have some side effects. I eat fast food as a treat, I try to balance things. It is sometimes difficult as I see ice-cream and I think ‘let me just try’ and healthy food is expensive. But with the drugs you would have to pay for it.” Waiting at a noodle takeaway van, Qabilah, 24, says she and a number of her friends have tried drinking lemons boiled in water as a weight-control trick. While she has not heard of the new weight loss jabs she would “probably give them a go” if she felt she needed it – but she remains not entirely convinced.  Matthew Hudson, a public health spokesperson from Luton borough council, says the drugs are “not a silver bullet” and probably should be reserved for those at the most extreme end of treatment to control their weight – surgery. “They are one of the things that can support and potentially help people but we are more focused on prevention and see that as more sustainable and feasible way of supporting the community,” he says."

        "content": "A public health policy that won rare backing from both the Biden and Trump administrations looks ready to open a flow of cheaper prescription drugs from Canada to Florida, ending a decades-long block on the importation of certain pharmaceuticals to the US.   Related: Could exercise pills help create a healthier society?    The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the state approval under a drugs importation program that seeks to lower the cost of medicines for US consumers without imposing additional risks to their health or safety. Pharmaceutical companies in the US cited safety concerns in their opposition to the program, which stalled after approval by Congress at the start of the century and was resurrected during Donald Trump’s presidency. The FDA on Thursday announced that Florida would be the first state allowed to import pharmaceuticals directly from Canadian manufacturers, a victory for the state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, who sued the Biden administration in 2022 for its “reckless delay” in granting approval. “Florida has been ready to deliver cheaper prescription drugs to those that need them for nearly two years,” DeSantis said at the time, his lawsuit calculating that consumers would save $150m in the first year following approval. Several steps must still take place before a two-year license can be issued and the first drugs cross the border. Florida must submit to the FDA details of the individual drugs it seeks to import, and verify their authenticity. FDA-approved labels must also be affixed to all imported Canadian pharmaceuticals. US drug manufacturers, meanwhile, are expected to file lawsuits to try to block the approval, while health authorities in Canada have also taken protective steps. When Trump announced the revival of the import program in 2020, Canadian lawmakers acted to block the export of drugs if it would create a shortage at home. “Canada’s drug supply is too small to meet the demands of both American and Canadian consumers,” Maryse Durette, a spokesperson for Health Canada, told the New York Times in an email. Other states seeking or planning to seek FDA approval under the scheme include Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin, the New York Times reported. Biden has made the reduction of drug costs to US consumers a policy priority. In a separate initiative, his administration has been negotiating the price of certain essential medicines with US pharmaceutical companies and last August announced the first 10 drugs proposed for price cuts."

        "content": "The US workforce added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected by economists, capping another robust year of growth in the face of higher interest rates. Policymakers, weighing when to start cutting borrowing costs, are closely monitoring the strength of the labor market as they try to guide the world’s largest economy to a so-called “soft landing”, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. American employers had been expected by economists to add about 164,000 jobs in December, down from 173,000 the previous month. Recruitment across the public, healthcare, social assistance and construction sectors helped drive growth as 2023 drew to a close. Overall, Friday’s official data showed that 2.7m jobs were added in the US economy over the course of last year – down from 4.8m in 2022. While its growth has slowed, the labor force has defied fears of a downturn after the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive campaign to pull back inflation from its highest levels in a generation. It remained resilient last year in the midst of layoffs and strikes. The headline unemployment rate stood at 3.7% in December, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in line with November. While last month’s jobs growth reading was significantly higher than forecast by economists, the agency revised its estimates for October and November lower. As a result, the US workforce in these two months was some 71,000 jobs smaller than previously reported. As price growth continues to decline, officials at the Fed – which last hiked interest rates in July – are now mulling the future of its battle. Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chairman, said last month that the historic tightening of monetary policy was probably over, and that discussions on cuts in borrowing costs were coming “into view”. The official jobs report is closely scrutinized by Wall Street each month for signs of how the US economy is faring. The S&P 500 started the day slightly higher in New York. Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said: “There is a lot of noise in the data, but we continue to expect that there will be enough evidence of a further loosening in labor market conditions and a decline in inflation more broadly to allow the Fed to begin cutting rates in May.” Growth in private sector employment “continues to slow relentlessly, even after the upside surprise” in December, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Behind the headline, the trend in job growth is slowing, with more softening to come.”"

Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year’s one-off subsidy in Germany.

Have a great weekend! We’ll be back next week. – JK     2.33pm GMT  Davies: 'did not intend to underplay serious challenges' for first-time buyers  NatWest Group chairman Sir Howard Davies has released a sort of mea culpa, a statement to clarify his earlier remarks that it’s not “that difficult” to buy a home and people just have to save for it. He said he “did not intend to underplay the serious challenges” people face buying homes. The interview on radio 4’s Today programme this morning provoked outrage, including from campaign group Generation Rent. Critics said his claims showed he was out of touch with the reality faced by many people trying to buy a home. Clarifying his remarks, Davies said:   Given recent rate movements by lenders there are some early green shoots in mortgage pricing and while funding remains strong, my comment was meant to reflect that in this context access to mortgages is less difficult than it has been. I fully realise it did not come across in that way for listeners and as I said on the programme, I do recognise how difficult it is for people buying a home and I did not intend to underplay the serious challenges they face. People have to save much more than they did in the past and that is tough for first-time buyers. The role for banks in today’s environment is to lend responsibly and support customers to build a savings habit and move towards home ownership.  Torsten Bell, who runs the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the time required to save for a typical first-time buyer deposit has spiralled in recent years.     2.25pm GMT   The dollar has given up the gains made since the US jobs numbers were released, as people realised they are not as strong as it first seemed. The greenback is now flat against the pound and the euro, after jumping 0.5% and 0.6% respectively when the data came out just under an hour ago. While employers hired 216,000 people in December, more than the 170,000 expected by Wall Street, the November and October increases in jobs were revised down by a total 71,000. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. Axel Merk, founder of Merk Investments, said:  Much of early market reaction to non-farm payroll now muted - in part as market may be digesting that the total labor force dropped by 676,000 pic.twitter.com/wAwzRdMuTX— Axel Merk (@AxelMerk) January 5, 2024   Updated at 2.26pm GMT    2.21pm GMT   Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:  There are a few vital signs officials can monitor when trying to diagnose the health of the economy, and the labour market is a crucial one. Developments show that the US labour market isn’t losing steam, ultimately suggesting that economic activity will need a heavier hand to slow it down. That could see interest rate cuts across the pond pushed further out than hoped – bad news for the market, which until recently was pricing in heavy cuts this year.  The data has short-term implications, but the bigger question looks to the future. The resilience shown by the US labour market has been markedly stronger than predicted, which makes bringing things in line without triggering a rock-hard landing becomes a much more delicate task.  2023 overall was a bumper year for the labour market, and the overall temperature is still too hot to be fully comfortable. There’s every chance the Federal Reserve will demand a run of softer macro readings before hitting the rewind button on rates. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the rate of labour growth is slowing, which is a step in the right direction, but there’s work to be done.      2.01pm GMT   Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said:  The slightly bigger-than-expected 216,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in December coupled with a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings means that this labour market report will trigger a further paring back of expectations for a March rate cut. At this stage, however, all that really matters for the Fed is the CPI and PPI data, due next week, which we expect to be more supportive of early action from the Fed. The 216,000 gain last month, was not quite as good as it looks at first glance. Gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 71,000. The increase in December was once again concentrated in only a few non-cyclical sectors, with government employment rising by 52,000 and health & social assistance employment up by 59,000. To the extent that it is still a leading indicator of broader employment trends, the 33,000 decline in temporary jobs is also a concern. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%, but only because a 676,000 drop back in the size of the labour force almost kept pace with a 683,000 decline in the household survey measure of employment. Those declines more than offset the big gains in November, meaning that both are now below the October levels. With the unemployment rate still muted, December brought a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings, which was enough to push the annual rate back up to 4.1%, from 4.0%.      1.59pm GMT   The dollar jumped after the stronger-than-expected increase in US jobs in December, as this suggests the Federal Reserve won’t be in a rush to interest rates. The dollar index hit 103.10, a fresh two-week high, and is now at 102.75, up 0.3%. The greenback strengthened as much as 0.5% against sterling and 0.6% against the euro. It is now trading 0.2% higher against the pound at $1.2650 and against the euro at $1.0917.  Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.49pm GMT   Some 52,000 new jobs were in government while 164,000 came from the private sector.

Economists had expected an increase between 150,000 and 170,000. November’s rise was revised to 173,000 from 199,000 while the October figure was also revised lower, to 105,000 from 150,000, according to the US Labor Department. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, while analysts had expected an uptick to 3.8%.   Updated at 1.42pm GMT    1.29pm GMT   In the meantime, shares in London-listed Revolution Bars have plunged nearly 20% after the company said it would shut eight of its worst-performing bars to reduce future site losses. The company’s bars and pubs trade under the Revolution, Revolución de Cuba and Peach Pubs brands. The closed bars are: Revolution Bars in Beaconsfield, Derby, Reading, St Peters Liverpool and Wilmslow, Revolución de Cubas in Sheffield and Southampton and the Playhouse in Newcastle-Under-Lyme. Negotiations for five of the eight bars have already begun for them to be transferred to other operators or their leases rescinded. The closures come despite a 9% rise in like-for-like sales in the four weeks from 4 to 31 December, the group’s best festive period since 2019. But it is worried about the current macro-economic conditions. Like-for-like sales for the first half, including New Year’s Eve, were on an improving trend but remained negative, with a decline of 2.8%. Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Revolution Bars Group, said:  We have had the best festive trading period for four years with all of our brands recording positive like for like sales and Revolución de Cuba being the standout performer. However, our younger customers are still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis and the national living wage will increase materially in April 2024. Therefore, we have taken the difficult yet ultimately beneficial step for the Group to close several bars which are unprofitable.   Updated at 1.46pm GMT    1.24pm GMT   Less than 10 minutes to go until non-farm payrolls, a key US jobs report, for December. We are expecting an 150,000 increase in jobs after November’s 199,000. The dollar is rising ahead of the data, heading for its steepest weekly rise since May, as traders are scaling back expectations of early US interest rate cuts this year. The dollar is up 0.2% against a basket of currencies, after touching a fresh three-week high. The index is up 1.3% this week so far, its strongest performance since the week to 15 May.     1.04pm GMT   The chair of NatWest Group, Sir Howard Davies, has been criticised as being out of touch, after he said it was not “that difficult” buy a house at the moment. The campaign group Generation Rent said Davies’s comments were “astounding to hear from a senior banker”.

They will advise you on arranging emergency accommodation if necessary (or any temporary alternative trading premises if you are a business with business interruption cover), the information they will need from you to support your claim, and how to go ahead with the immediate clean-up and repair process.  Step 2 - Assessing the damage and finding temporary accommodation. A loss adjuster will be appointed to assess the claim. An initial assessment of the damage will be done, the repair process explained and the options for alternative accommodation outlined. You should expect to hear from your loss adjuster after contacting your insurer and they will get in touch if they need to arrange a visit to your home.  Step 3 - Cleaning and stripping out. Your loss adjuster will organise the cleaning and stripping out of your home. This work should start within four weeks of discussing it with your loss adjuster.  Step 4 - Disinfecting and drying your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will appoint a drying company to disinfect and dry out your home. This can take from a few weeks to several months. Your loss adjuster will give you a timetable and keep you informed.  Step 5 - Repair and reconstruction. Repair work should begin shortly after you get your drying certificate from the drying company. Your loss adjuster will appoint a builder to do the repair and reconstruction work and will keep you updated on expected timeframes.  Step 6 - Moving back into your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will discuss with you when you can return home. Depending on how badly damaged your home is, this can be between a few weeks and a year or more after the flood.  Some insurers will provide “Build Back Better” which offers homeowners the chance to install Property Flood Resilience measures up to the value of £10,000 when repairing their properties after a flood. Speak to your insurer about whether you are eligible.  The ABI’s guide is here.      12.56pm GMT   Here is some insurance advice for homeowners and businesses who have been affected by flooding and storm Henk, from the Association of British Insurers. Damage caused by floods and storm is covered by most standard home insurance and commercial business policies, and comprehensive motor insurance.   Related: Cold weather alert issued after homes flooded and transport network hit across England and Wales – live   Louise Clark, general insurance policy adviser at the industry body, said:  Insurers expect bad weather to strike at any time and events such as this are exactly what your insurance is for. Their priority right now is to help any affected customers recover as quickly as possible. If you have been affected by flooding, contact your insurer as soon as you can and they will be able to offer help and advice.  If you have suffered storm damage: · Contact your insurer as soon as possible. Most will have 24-hour emergency helplines to ensure you get advice on what to do and arrange repairs as quickly as is possible. · If necessary, arrange temporary emergency repairs to stop any damage getting worse, but speak to your insurer first. If you have to arrange emergency repairs yourself, tell your insurer and keep any receipts, as this will form part of your claim. · Do not be in a rush to throw away damaged items, unless they are a danger to health, as these may be able to be repaired or restored. Your insurer will advise. If your home is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out your insurer will arrange for, and pay the cost of, any alternative temporary accommodation you may need in line with your policy. Commercial polices will cover damage to premises and stock. Business interruption cover (which may be included or purchased separately) will cover additional trading costs, such as hiring temporary alternative trading premises if necessary.  Here is the guidance in full.  Updated at 12.57pm GMT    12.52pm GMT    Overall in the UK Construction PMI, construction new work fell in December & it has been falling since August,  which points to further falls in construction activity in 2024 H1 (especially in house building) but... (11/n)#ukconstruction pic.twitter.com/xNuqdQXsZf— Noble Francis (@NobleFrancis) January 5, 2024      12.23pm GMT  UK's construction sector decline eases  The downturn in the UK’s construction sector eased last month to the slowest rate of decline since September, according to a survey. A sustained slump in house building was the main factor holding back construction output, which firms linked to elevated interest rates and subdued confidence among clients. The headline purchasing managers’ index, which tracks changes in industry activity, rose to 46.8 in December from 45.5 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Improving supply conditions meant delivery times for construction items shortened for the tenth month in a row. Price discounting among suppliers contributed to a moderate fall in average cost burdens across the construction sector at the end of 2023. Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey said:   Construction companies experienced another fall in business activity at the end of 2023 as weak order books meant a lack of new work to replace completed projects. House building was the worst-performing area of construction activity, but even in this segment there were signs that the downturn has started to ease. “ Elevated borrowing costs and a subsequent slump in market confidence were the main factors leading to falling sales volumes across the construction sector in the second half of 2023. Survey respondents also continued to cite worries about the broader UK economic outlook, especially in relation to prospects for commercial construction.  However, expectations of falling interest rates during the months ahead appear to have supported confidence levels among construction companies. December data indicated that 41% of construction firms predict a rise in business activity over the course of 2024, while only 17% forecast a decline. This contrasted with negative sentiment overall at the same time a year earlier.  Industry expert Noble Francis tweeted:  UK construction activity fell in December 2023 according to the latest S&P Global UK Construction PMI data (46.8) but it fell a slower rate than in November (45.5) where 50=no monthly change (& below 50 represents a decline in activity).

As anticipated by yesterday’s national numbers, eurozone inflation rate increased in December. But this was mainly driven by the energy component. German energy inflation, up to 4% was the main culprit as energy inflation was impacted by a strong base effect from the one-off gas price break in December 2022. Apart from energy, all the other components continued their disinflationary trend. Although some of the components, such as food remain elevated and subject to some volatility, the disinflation dynamic is still quite clear. Food inflation (which also includes alcohol and tobacco) was at 6.1% in December, down from around 10% in the summer. Moreover, the second monthly increase in unprocessed foods inflation was very likely driven by unfavourable weather conditions and hence should soon readjust downwards. Core inflation dropped to 3.4%, from 3.6% in November, driven by a decrease in non-energy industrial goods inflation. Services inflation remained at 4% over the year, but also in this area the monthly dynamic offers some optimism. The 0.7% m/m increase in services inflation is a touch lower than the 2010-2019 average December monthly increase… Overall, apart from the monthly volatility, this was another encouraging inflation report and further confirms that a quick disinflationary process is underway. But today’s print will not offer any major insights on the ECB easing cycle. We expect that the January inflation print will be much more informative, as large price adjustments typically happen at the start of the year, with this year’s January print also impacted by the end of the energy-related fiscal measures in some countries. We will follow up on this specifically in forthcoming research.      10.52am GMT   Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said:  The increase in headline inflation was mainly driven by energy base effects in Germany. The core inflation rate dropped from 3.6 to 3.4%, indicating that the underlying trend in inflation remains relatively benign for the moment. Food inflation also continued to trend down rapidly. Inflationary pressures made way for disinflation over the course of 2023 as demand weakened and supply shocks faded. This has brought inflation down more than expected at the start of last year. Currently though, base effects from easing supply shocks are moderating and some new inflationary concerns are surfacing. Think of the increased supply chain concerns related to the Red Sea. Besides that, German government measures are also adding to inflation for 2024. The European Central Bank’s mantra has always been that the last leg is the hardest. Is this what we are currently witnessing? Don’t overestimate the inflationary pressures for now though. Demand remains weak, which is a very important disinflationary driver right now. Also, inventories are high, making current supply chain concerns much less inflationary than the ones from 2021. And even though energy price shocks related to the Middle East are a clear risk to the outlook, oil prices are currently still below US$80 per barrel. So overall, the outlook for inflation continues to be quite benign and we expect eurozone inflation to be around 2% again by the end of the year.  And what does this mean for interest rates?  Current inflationary developments therefore seem to support our view that recent market expectations of a first-quarter hike are premature, but don’t think that we’re back to ‘higher for longer’ either. We expect the ECB to start cautiously cutting rates from June onwards, with 75bp in total for 2024.      10.39am GMT  NatWest boss: Not 'that difficult' for people to buy a house  Sir Howard Davies, chair of NatWest Group, has caused a bit of a stir with his comments this morning that it’s not “that difficult” for people to get on the housing ladder. He said on BBC radio 4’s Today programme:  I don’t think it’s that difficult at the moment [to buy a house]. You have to save, and that’s the way it always used to be… But what we saw in the financial crisis was the risk of having people being able to borrow 100% In order to get onto the property ladder and then suffering severe falls in the equity value of their houses and having to leave and having a bad credit record etc. So there were dangers in very, very easy access to mortgage credit. So I totally recognise that there are people who find it very difficult to start the process. They will have to save more. But that is, I think, inherent in the change in the financial system, as a result of the mistakes that were made in the last global financial crisis and we have to accept we’re still living with that.   Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.31am GMT  Electric car sales in UK flatline, prompting calls for VAT cut  The number of new cars registered in the UK has jumped by nearly 18% but electric vehicle demand is flatlining, prompting the industry to call for a VAT cut to stimulate sales. Annual figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) on Friday show 1.9m new cars were registered last year, well up on the previous year’s figure of 1.6m and the highest level since the 2.3m registrations of 2019. The increase is a boost for the automotive industry after the pandemic led to supply chain problems and a shortage of vital computer chips that slowed production. Across the year, 315,000 new battery electric vehicles were sold. That was 50,000 more than 2022, but the number being bought as a share of total registrations failed to grow as expected. They represented just 16.5% of the total, slightly down on last year’s 16.6%.   Related: Electric car sales in UK flatline, prompting calls for VAT cut        10.24am GMT  Eurozone inflation rises to 2.9%  Inflation in the eurozone has risen again and could go higher in the coming months, which makes early interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank less likely. Inflation across the 20-nation bloc rose to 2.9% in December from November’s two-year low of 2.4% because of a reduction of government subsidies on gas, electricity and food. The data are in line with the ECB’s expectation that inflation bottomed out in November. The central bank is projecting that price growth will range between 2.5% and 3% through 2024, well above its 2% target, before slowing again next year. However, underlying inflation – price growth excluding food and energy which tend to be volatile – eased to 3.4% from 3.6%. The ECB, which next meets on 25 January to discuss monetary policy, pushed back against investor expectations of imminent rate cuts last month. It wants to see wage pressures cool first to ensure infation is on track to fall back to its target.      9.47am GMT   Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto Financial Services, said:  European stock markets slipped in early trading, pushing the main indices firmly into the red in the first week of trading in 2024 as the data paints a picture of weakening economic activity and higher inflation.  Weak PMI data for the euro area was confirmed, whilst German consumer inflation surged higher as energy subsidies faded. German’s inflation hit 3.8% in December, up from 2.3% in Nov. Final inflation data for the Eurozone as a whole is due at 10am, expected up to 3.0% from 2.4%.  Meanwhile FOMC minutes earlier this week suggested the Fed is not quite so close to cutting rates; the US 10-year Treasury yield broke above 4%, helping the dollar hit its highest since the middle of December and keeping the pressure on risk assets.  Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris all retreated on Friday morning, with the US jobs report in focus. The Nasdaq notched its fifth straight daily decline on Thursday, whilst the S&P 500 dropped for a fourth session in a row with Apple suffering again on another downgrade. For the week, the FTSE 100 is off about three-quarters of a percent, held up relative to peers with oil firmer, whilst the Dax is down 1.4% and CAC is 2% lower with luxury taking a bit of a bashing on China fears.       9.44am GMT  Stocks fall; crude oil prices rise over 1%  On the financial markets, stocks are falling while crude oil prices have risen more than 1% amid tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude futures are up 87 cents at $78.46 a barrel while US light crude is 97 cents ahead at $73.16 a barrel.

On the stock markets , the FTSE 100 index has fallen nearly 67 points, or 0.9%, to 7,656, as optimism about interest rate cuts fades.  Germany’s Dax is down 105 points, or 0.6%, at 16,513 while France’s CAC has lost 66 points, a 0.9% drop to 7,384. Italy’s FTSE MiB has shed 184 points, or 0.6%, to 30,221.     8.38am GMT  NatWest chair: Likely we will see slow reduction in interest rates  Sir Howard Davies, who chairs NatWest, has warned that we we could see a “rather slow reduction in interest rates” this year because “wage expectations are quite high”. Speaking on radio 4’s Today programme, he explained why lenders have already started to cut mortgage rates in a fierce price war. As financial markets are now expecting a series of rate cuts from the Bank of England this year,  therefore you can, as a bank, fix your interest rate at a slightly lower level than you could even a couple of months ago. And it’s that fixing of the rates in the market that determines what we can offer to customers. So the market expectations of rates are falling, therefore, we can pass that on to people who want a new mortgage.  He said because the Bank of England was criticised for being slow to raise interest rates when inflation shot up mainly due to higher energy and food prices, policymakers will be careful when they reduce borrowing costs.  Even at the last meeting in December, three of the nine members of the [rate-setting] committee still voted for a further increase in rates. So they’re quite a long way away at the moment from a majority in favour of a reduction in rates. And there is a risk of that, having been burned once by reacting too slowly. They are now going to be rather cautious in coming down.  It’s likely that we will see a rather slow reduction in rates during the year. They will of course be influenced by what is going on in retail prices, not rising anything like as rapidly as they were, but still wage expectations are quite high and that if you read the recent speeches from the Bank of England, thats what’s worrying them the most.      8.13am GMT   Here’s a lookahead to what 2024 might bring in the housing market:   Related: Britain’s housing market may be ‘past peak pain’ but what will 2024 bring?       8.11am GMT   The EY Item Club forecasting group said the 1.1% month-on-month rise in the Halifax measure of house prices in December capped off a year when values proved much more resilient than forecasters had expected.  An average of the Halifax and Nationwide measures was down 1.5% in the fourth quarter on a year earlier, in contrast to consensus predictions last January of a fall of 6.5%.  Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the group, said:  Two factors have led to a modest correction. Firstly, unemployment has remained low. Secondly, the rise in mortgage interest rates has been much more protracted than in the past, reflecting a shift in the mortgage stock from variable to fixed rate. Both factors have kept forced sales down and limited supply. The closing months of 2023 saw a recovery in demand for properties, albeit from a low level. Mortgage approvals in December rose to a six-month high. This was probably aided by falling mortgage rates, as investors have priced in a substantial series of rate cuts by the Bank of England this year.  The EY Item Club thinks this recovery should continue as mortgage rates continue to drift down and lower inflation makes for a likely more predictable macroeconomic outlook. The fact that the ratio of house prices to average earnings is down by over a tenth since the 2022 peak, reflecting a fall in prices alongside strong growth in wages, should also support demand.      8.03am GMT       7.42am GMT   This can cause a lot of stress and sleepless nights. My colleague Jedidajah Otte has talked to homeowners who fear a sharp rise in mortgage payments as they come off fixed-rate deals this year.   Related: ‘Sleepless nights’: UK homeowners fear 2024 mortgage timebomb       7.39am GMT   However, mortgage costs are still much higher than they have been in recent years after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 5.25% to fight stubbornly high inflation. (Financial markets expect it to cut rates to below 4% by the end of the year.) As a result, homeowners are facing a £19bn increase in mortgage costs as millions more fixed-rate deals expire and borrowers are forced to renegotiate their home loans after the toughest round of interest rate increases in decades, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Despite an escalating price war between lenders cutting the cost of remortgaging in recent days, economists at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs said many UK households would still experience a dramatic leap in repayments compared with the deals they were leaving behind. In what has been described as a Tory mortgage timebomb by Rishi Sunak’s critics, just over 1.5m households are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals in 2024 – with an increase in annual housing costs of about £1,800 for the typical family, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. As fixed-rate deals expire and households absorb the biggest hit to their finances in the postwar age, with inflation and tax rises taking their toll on spending power, borrowers are turning to a range of measures to cope with the increased costs, from renting out rooms in their homes to drawing down pensions early and even postponing having children.   Related: UK homeowners face £19bn rise in mortgage costs as fixed-rate deals expire    Updated at 7.44am GMT    7.33am GMT   Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Capital markets, said:  The demise of the UK housing market is somewhat over reported. The Halifax reported today that house prices rose by 1.7% in 2023, an increase of £4,800. Most, including us, thought house prices would fall during 2023, and most think they will fall in 2024, but not us. With rising wages, falling inflation, falling mortgage rates, and increasing talk of election related housing stimulus packages we expect house prices to rise in 2024. Our pessimism was misplaced in 2023, and we don’t want to make the same mistake twice.   Updated at 8.02am GMT    7.27am GMT  Introduction: UK house prices rise for third month amid property shortage  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. House prices in the UK rose for the third consecutive month in December, reflecting a shortage of properties on the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. It added that with mortgage rates easing, confidence among buyers may improve in the coming months. The cost of an average home rose by 1.1% to £287,105, just over £3,000 more than in November and the highest level since March, Halifax said. This comes after monthly gains of 0.6% and 1.2% in November and October. Compared with December 2022, values were up 1.7%, the first annual growth in eight months, following a 0.8% drop in November. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said:  The housing market beat expectations in 2023 and grew by 1.7% on an annual basis. The average property price is now £4,800 higher than it was in December 2022. Whilst it’s encouraging that we saw growth in the last three months of the year, this was preceded with property price falls for six consecutive months between April and September. The growth we have seen is likely being driven by a shortage of properties on the market, rather than the strength of buyer demand. That said, with mortgage rates continuing to ease, we may see an increase in confidence from buyers over the coming months.  Across all the UK regions, Northern Ireland recorded the strongest house price growth in 2023, as properties increased in value by 4.1% to £192,153. Scotland saw property prices increase by 2.6% to £205,170. At the other end of the scale, the south east fell most sharply, houses there now average £376,804, a drop of £17,755 or 4.5%. Halifax expects prices to fall by between 2% and 4% this year as many still struggle to afford the sharply higher mortgage costs compared with recent years following a series of Bank of England rate hikes. The question is when will the central bank start cutting rates? Financial markets are betting that the first reduction will come by May. Kinnaird explained:  As we move through 2024, the UK property market will continue to reflect the wider economic uncertainty and buyers and sellers are likely to be naturally cautious when considering making a move. While wage growth is now above inflation, helping to ease cost of living pressures for some and improving housing affordability, interest rates are likely to remain elevated for as long as inflation remains markedly above the Bank of England’s target.  Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said:  The housing market saw a remarkably strong finish to the year, as buyer and seller confidence was boosted by three consecutive interest rate holds and the growing belief that the next move in rates will be downwards. Increased competitiveness among lenders leads to lower mortgage rates and we find ourselves in the midst of a price war. With HSBC launching the headline-grabbing 3.94% five-year fix and reductions from Halifax, NatWest, TSB and other lenders, the gloves really are off. With 2023 being a disappointing year in terms of amount of business done, lenders are keen to get this year off to a cracking start. Increased competition, rates aside, may also lead to lenders broadening criteria to attract business with longer mortgage terms or greater flexibility to allow certain variable incomes. Although those remortgaging this year will still see an increase in their payments, the pain will not be as bad as it could have been.  Later today we will get the US non-farm payrolls report for December, which is expected to show that the economy added 150,00 jobs following November’s 199,000 increase.

        "content": "Inflation across the eurozone rose in December after an increase in energy costs, reversing six months of consecutive falls and easing the pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year’s one-off subsidy in Germany. In the flash estimate for December, inflation in food, alcohol and tobacco prices continued to moderate, easing some of the pressure on households across the bloc as the rate across those categories dipped from 6.9% in November to 6.1% last month. The figures come amid speculation the ECB will begin cutting interest rates within months amid a worsening economic slowdown across the eurozone, having increased borrowing costs to the highest level since the launch of the euro. Financial markets widely expect the world’s largest central banks to slash interest rates this year as inflation falls back after the shock from the Covid pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, while there are growing fears of recession in several advanced economies. Economists said December’s inflation data was unlikely to dramatically shift the timing of the ECB’s first cut in interest rates because an increase in the headline rate had been widely expected after energy support schemes expired. “Some investors will undoubtedly be concerned that this spike in inflation may put the ECB off cutting interest rates sooner rather than later,” said Michael Field, the European market strategist at Morningstar. “However, central bankers were always aware of the potential for this spike in inflation, thus it shouldn’t factor in on their decision-making process. All eyes are on next month’s inflation release, and whether we can get back to that all-important downward trend.” Financial markets are betting the ECB will cut rates six times this year, with the first move coming as early as the spring. However, the central bank’s president, Christine Lagarde, has warned it remains too early to “start declaring victory” over inflation, while arguing that rates would need to remain high for a lengthy period to ensure inflation falls back to its 2% target. Jack Allen-Reynolds, the deputy chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the jump in December was “just a blip” and that inflation across the 20-nation bloc would probably continue to fall over the coming months. “Past declines in food producer prices have not yet fully fed through to consumer prices. Core goods inflation should keep falling as the impact of improved global supply conditions and lower energy prices continues to be felt.”"

        "content": "The chair of NatWest has claimed it is not “that difficult” to get on the property ladder, despite the number of first-time buyers with a mortgage falling to the lowest level in a decade. “I don’t think it is that difficult at the moment,” Sir Howard Davies told the BBC. Pressed about this assertion, he added: “You have to save, and that is the way it always used to be.” His comments to Radio 4’s Today programme follow a report published this week by Yorkshire Building Society, which found that the number of first-time buyers who bought a home with a mortgage fell to the lowest level in a decade in 2023. A 20% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home equated to about 105% of the average annual gross income, according to the report, although this is down from a high of 116% in 2022. Davies told Today: “I totally recognise that there are people who are finding it very difficult to start the process [of buying a house]. They will have to save more, but that is, I think, inherent in the change in the financial system as a result of the mistakes that were made in the last global financial crisis.” On Friday, the lender Halifax recorded the third monthly rise in house prices in a row in December, with the typical home costing £287,105. “Was there ever a more out-of-touch statement about homebuying?” said Marty Naan, a mortgage and protection adviser. “Telling first-time buyers it’s not that difficult to get on the ladder is quite simply a slap in the face to people struggling to make ends meet, never mind save for a deposit on a mortgage.” The campaign group Generation Rent said Davies’s comments were “astounding to hear from a senior banker”. Speaking to PA Media, its chief executive, Ben Twomey, said: “What planet does he live on? We are in a cost-of-renting crisis that is making it incredibly hard for people to buy a home as we hand a third of our wages every month over to our landlord. “Interest rates have increased but house prices have yet to correct, meaning we still need to save for a huge deposit, but also would need a high income to afford monthly mortgage repayments.” Davies later issued a statement saying his comments had been meant to reflect the fact it had become easier to access a mortgage recently. “There are some early green shoots in mortgage pricing and while funding remains strong, my comment was meant to reflect that in this context access to mortgages is less difficult than it has been,” he said. “I fully realise it did not come across in that way for listeners and as I said on the programme, I do recognise how difficult it is for people buying a home and I did not intend to underplay the serious challenges they face.”  It is not the first time that Davies, who is to stand down as chair of the banking group later this year, has faced a furore over ill-advised comments. Last year, he weathered calls for his resignation after initially backing Alison Rose in the row over a media leak pertaining to the closure of the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage’s accounts with the NatWest subsidiary Coutts. Rose was forced to resign as the NatWest chief executive, and the banking group scrapped almost £7.6m in potential payouts over the scandal. In 2022, Davies made headlines when he told hundreds of staff at a private event that he “never felt so embarrassed internationally” as he did at the International Monetary Fund meeting after the UK’s disastrous mini-budget announced by the then chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng."

        "content": "The gold producer Endeavour Mining has fired its chief executive, Sébastien de Montessus, for alleged “serious misconduct” over allegations of an “irregular payment” of $5.9m (£4.7m). London-headquartered Endeavour said it was also investigating whistleblower allegations made against De Montessus “relating to his personal conduct with colleagues”.  Shares in the company fell by 12% on Friday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The company announced the departure of De Montessus, who was also the president of Endeavour, with “immediate effect” late on Thursday. “This follows an investigation by the board into an irregular payment instruction issued by him in relation to an asset disposal undertaken by the company,” Endeavour said in a statement. “The amount of this irregular payment instruction is $5.9m. The board recently became aware of this in the course of a review of acquisitions and disposals, which is ongoing. “Separately, in October 2023, allegations were made against Sébastien de Montessus through the company’s confidential whistleblowing channel relating to his personal conduct with colleagues. Following a recent external investigation, the board had received the findings and, at the point of termination, was considering the appropriate course of action.” Endeavour, which operates four mines in west Africa, including in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, said that its investigation into the allegedly irregular payment was continuing. De Montessus said: “In 2021, I instructed a creditor of Endeavour plc to offset an amount owed to the company to pay for essential security equipment to protect our partners and employees in a conflict zone. The decision had no additional cost to the company and did not benefit me personally in any way. I omitted to inform the board that I had arranged for this offset, which I have freely accepted was a lapse in judgment. “This week I was given 48 hours’ notice of the concerns and no proper opportunity to answer them. As to the other investigation: no misconduct of any kind was discovered because none occurred. I am proud of what we have built together at Endeavour over the past eight years. I will take my time to consider my position with my advisers.” In December, BP formally dismissed its chief executive, Bernard Looney, with immediate effect, and said it would deny him more than £32m in pay and share awards, over “serious misconduct” relating to his past relationships with colleagues."

        "content": "UK house prices rose for a third consecutive month in December amid a shortage of properties on the market, but are forecast to drop this year, according to Halifax. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, which this week joined in new year rate cutting, said that property prices grew by 1.1% in December, after a 0.6% rise in November and a 1.2% increase in October. A typical home in the UK is now worth £287,105, about £3,000 more than in November. However, Halifax said that the monthly, quarterly and annual growth rates were driven by a shortage of properties on the market rather than strong buyer demand.   Related: Britain’s housing market may be ‘past peak pain’ but what will 2024 bring?   “That said, with mortgage rates continuing to ease, we may see an increase in confidence from buyers over the coming months,” said Kim Kinnaird, the director of Halifax Mortgages. It is the first time in eight months that Halifax has reported annual growth in the UK housing market, with prices up by 1.7% year on year in December. “A clean sweep of positive house price growth in December could be considered somewhat of a Christmas miracle given the turbulent year 2023 turned out to be,” said Marc von Grundherr, a director of the London estate agency Benham and Reeves. Figures released by the Bank of England on Thursday showed that mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to 50,100 in November, from 47,900 in October, pointing to a strengthening of demand. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs have estimated that UK homeowners are facing a £19bn increase in mortgage costs by the end of next year as millions more fixed-rate deals expire, putting additional strain on household finances. Halifax still expects house prices to fall by up to 4% this year as high interest rates and inflation stretch mortgage affordability. The lender said that the price of an average UK property would fall by between 2% and 4% this year, despite a new year mortgage rate-cutting spree by major lenders. “As we move through 2024, the UK property market will continue to reflect the wider uncertainty, and buyers and sellers are likely to be naturally cautious when considering making a move,” Kinnaird said. “While wage growth is now above inflation, helping ease cost of living pressures for some and improving housing affordability, interest rates are likely to remain elevated for as long as inflation remains markedly above the Bank of England’s target.” In December, the Bank held interest rates at 5.25% for a third consecutive time – even as the rate of inflation fell to 3.9% in November, its lowest rate in two years. The Bank’s target rate of inflation is 2%. Halifax said that the south-east of England continued to experience the most downward pressure on house prices, with homes dropping by an average of 4.5% over the last year. London remains at the top spot for the highest average house price across all the regions, at £528,798, although prices in the capital have declined by 2.3% annually. Northern Ireland continues to be the strongest performing nation or region in the UK, with house prices increasing by 4.1% annually. Properties in Northern Ireland now cost on average £192,153. “We should be wary of reading too much into a couple of months of positive price data, but there is a growing perception on the property front line that things are turning a corner,” said Jonathan Hopper, the chief executive of Garrington Property Finders. “We’re seeing increasing numbers of strategic buyers, who sat on the fence last year while prices fell, restart their previously paused plans. Buyers are coming back and prices are stabilising as a result.”"

        "content": "If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected. Nevertheless it seems reasonable to predict that certain familiar themes will dominate the international financial picture in 2024. Here we unpack what the next 12 months are likely to hold in store for major economies, interest rates and markets. Political dangers With fears of widening turmoil in the Middle East, and the Russia-Ukraine war on track to enter its third year, geopolitical issues could again rock markets. Disruption to shipping in the Red Sea from Houthi rebel attacks is already pushing up transport costs, adding to inflation pressures, with shipping companies adding thousands of miles to their routes to avoid the region. Vincent Chaigneau, head of research at Generali Investments, says other risks to the 2024 outlook include the possibility of the Opec+ oil cartel rationing production further to push prices up, further weakening electoral support for mainstream parties and increasing tensions between Beijing and Washington during the US election campaign, expected to be fought between the incumbent, Joe Biden, and former president Donald Trump. ABN Amro predict that falling rates should help drive a recovery later in 2024, but warn that risks loom “from a possible Trump 2.0, to a potential EU-China trade spat, and more broadly, the tail risk of a more disorderly decoupling between the west and China”. Elections are taking place this year in countries that represent 60% of global GDP – including India, the European Union and the UK (unless Rishi Sunak holds out to January 2025) – but it is the White House race that markets care most about. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says research suggests “the US stock market traditionally gets a mild attack of the nerves in the final year of a presidency”, but the Bank of America argues the opposite, pointing to a 75% rise in the US S&P 500 index in election years. Allianz Research cautions that overall “the packed election calendar in 2024 will add to economic uncertainty … In this context, governments, households and companies are likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach, postponing key economic decisions.” If Labour wins a UK general election, as polling has consistently predicted, RBC Wealth Management do not expect a strong negative reaction in financial markets. “The party seems to have transitioned towards the centre and has markedly improved ties with the corporate sector,” it says. Shares: a new ‘roaring 20s’? Last year ended with a strong rally across risk assets, with shares and bond prices both strengthening sharply in November and December. The S&P 500 ended 2023 just short of an all-time high, at almost 4,770 points, and many analysts expect it to climb in 2024. Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, predicts the index will end this year at 5,400 points, and climb further to 6,000 by the end of 2025. Yardeni argues that the markets could see a “roaring 20s” rally like the one 100 years ago, with consumers continuing to spend while they enjoy job security, as “the awesome ability of US corporations to generate cash flow” supports the US economy. However, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the S&P 500 would end 2024 roughly where it started, although he sees “particular opportunity in quality stocks” including the US tech sector.  S&P 500 targets by firm for 2024:JP Morgan: 4200Morgan Stanley: 4500Wells Fargo: 4700Evercore ISI: 4750Barclays: 4800UBS: 4850Bank of America: 5000Goldman Sachs: 5100Deutsche Bank: 5100Citi: 5100Oppenheimer: 5200What's your target? 🎯  $SPY $SPX— TrendSpider (@TrendSpider) December 19, 2023  Britain’s FTSE 100 index lagged behind other major indices last year, only rising by less than 4% to finish 2023 at 7733 points, while global markets gained 20%. But the blue-chip index could make up ground. In a poll of interactive investor customers, one in four predicted the FTSE 100 would end 2024 at over 8,000 points. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, calculates that UK companies are undervalued by around 19% compared with international rivals, partly due to Brexit and the UK’s sluggish economic outlook. The UK: recession fears grow Employment is expected to fall, lifting the jobless rate to 5% next year and 5.2% in 2025. UK inflation is also expected to continue downward, with Morgan Stanley predicting it will average 2.8% over the year, down from 3.9% in November but still over the Bank of England (BoE) target of 2%. Meanwhile, fears of a UK recession rose at the end of 2023 after updated GDP data showed a small contraction in July to September. Morgan Stanley forecasts that the UK will contract by 0.1% during 2024, falling into a technical recession of at least two consecutive quarters of contraction. Morgan Stanley told clients: “The UK economy is stuck in a fragile equilibrium, with a challenging policy mix. Exit is unlikely to be painless – we see a technical recession at the turn of the year and a weak economy over 2024.” With the economy weak and price rises slowing, investors are expecting the BoE to slash interest rates in 2024 from the current 5.25% – pricing in a drop to 3.75% by December. The BoE has pushed back against such expectations, repeatedly insisting it is too early to consider cuts.  Homeowners looking to remortgage are already benefiting from the improved forecasts, with major lenders cutting the cost of their fixed-rate deals this week to lower than 4% in some cases. Rates at other central banks The market is generally betting against the “higher-for-longer” theory – the idea that central banks will keep borrowing costs restrictive for some time to fight inflation. Both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to cut interest rates several times in 2024. The Fed is forecast to cut rates to a 3.75%-4% range by the end of the year, down from 5.25%-5.5% today. “The central thesis is that with absolute conviction inflation is heading towards target, labour markets cooling sufficiently and growth at far more subdued levels” interest rates should be lowered, explains Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. In the eurozone, inflation fell closer to the European Central Bank’s 2% target last autumn. In early December, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said this “remarkable” fall in inflation meant further interest rate hikes were now off the table. The global outlook: ‘resilient but sluggish’ Oxford Economics believes the global economy will pull off a soft landing, but adds that growth in 2024 “will likely be lacklustre” by post-2008 standards. It is likely to slow because of factors including high interest rates and government spending squeezes.  Morgan Stanley predicts global growth will slow in 2024 to 2.8%, down from an estimated 3% in 2023. In Europe, they expect barely positive growth of 0.5% in 2024 and 1% in 2025, reflecting “the continued effects of energy supply shocks, especially on Germany, and lagged effects of tight monetary policy”. It predicts China will weigh on growth in emerging markets, while its “global downside scenario” imagines a protracted debt-deflation cycle in China, triggered by widespread defaults in the housing sector, that spills over to other economies. Société Générale captures the mood with a 2024 Global Economic Outlook titled “Resilient but sluggish” and accompanied by an image of a sloth. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, predicts the world economy will “flirt with recession in 2024” and the US will suffer a mild recession in the first six months, with the economy only growing 0.6% over the year, while the eurozone is only seen expanding by 0.2% in its second year of effective stagnation. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says it is more likely than not that the US and Europe will get through their major inflationary episodes without suffering deep recessions. “By postwar standards that would be remarkable. We are not out of the woods, but business and consumers have proved resilient in the face of high inflation and high rates. If central banks can engineer a soft landing, we would be looking at the start of a new upswing in the economic cycle in 2024,” Stewart predicts."

        "content": "This year’s award for the first shopkeeper to cite the weather in its Christmas profits warning goes to JD Sports. Specifically, the group didn’t care for how mild it has been – not good for shifting fleeces – although the same temperatures didn’t seem to bother Next, which turned in its usual upgrades to forecasts. So the story probably lies in the other factors mentioned by JD. The group blamed “more cautious consumer spending” and “an elevated level of promotional activity during the peak trading period”. Possible translation: more and more punters think the entire ‘athleisure’ industry – from big brands such as Nike and Adidas, to the likes of JD itself – had elevated prices to silly levels. Who could blame them? When the retail price of the latest “essential” variation on an old line of Nike trainers is £175, more than a few would-be buyers may conclude that a purchase is actually inessential, or decide to wait until the product goes on sale. In the past, the industry has tended to dismiss such concerns as the fogeyish thinking of those who don’t understand the must-have status of the buzzier fashion ranges. And it has usually been able to demonstrate its point: the hype machine in crossover sportswear is a wonder of modern marketing. Yet this Christmas season seems to have been marked by a mass outbreak of late discounting by big brands and retailers, with JD obliged to join in. The intriguing aspect is that JD’s profits warning, like Nike’s before Christmas, comes at a moment when the trading backdrop wasn’t obviously unhelpful. Overall employment levels, it used to be said, dictate the real incomes of the core 16 to 24-year-old target market and, on that front in the UK at least, there isn’t a problem, notwithstanding wider cost-of-living pressures. As recently as late-September, JD said it expected headline pre-tax profits for this financial year to arrive at £1.04bn, so the latest prediction of £915m-£935m represents a £100m-plus gap that has appeared over the peak season. That’s chunky. JD could still report a 1.8% improvement in like-for-like revenues in the last five months of 2023 and, with the contribution from new stores, overall revenues should still be 8% higher over the course of a financial year that closes in early February. This is still a growth company making a very substantial profit and enjoying the benefit of a diversified revenue base that is split roughly evenly between the UK, the rest of Europe and the US. Nor is JD’s closeness to major brands, and thus its ability to get sweetheart access to the top lines, about to disappear. Yet the 23% slump in the share price still looks rational. There is a new uncertainty here. Has the industry’s phenomenal ability to crank the fashion handle and maintain pricing power reached a natural ceiling for now? JD didn’t venture a forecast for the 2024-25 year. Very wise: the mood among athleisure consumers seems to have turned very suddenly."

        "content": "The world faces a protracted period of weak economic growth that will undermine progress on sustainable development, the UN has warned, as it urged countries to raise investment to tackle the climate emergency. Its annual assessment of the state of the global economy presents a sombre outlook for growth as countries grapple with the impact of higher borrowing costs, geopolitical tensions and heightened risk of climate disasters. Global growth will slow to 2.4% this year from 2.7% in 2023 – significantly below the pre-Covid pandemic trend of 3% – amid “strong headwinds” facing the planet, the World Economic Situation and Prospects report forecasts. The warning comes as leading central banks continue to deploy high interest rates in response to the sharpest inflationary burst in decades after the economic impact of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Warning that sluggish economic growth could undermine progress towards the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) – which include ending poverty and tackling global heating – the report said more international cooperation was required to stimulate growth and promote the green transition. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: “2024 must be the year when we break out of this quagmire. By unlocking big, bold investments, we can drive sustainable development and climate action, and put the global economy on a stronger growth path for all.” The latest forecasts show global inflation is projected to decline from about 5.7% in 2023 to 3.9% this year, helping to ease the pressure on households and businesses. However, the report warns price pressures remain elevated, while sounding the alarm that any further escalation of geopolitical conflicts risks a renewed inflationary burst. The UN’s findings come amid concerns over the impact of disruption to shipping through the vital Red Sea trade route after attacks by Houthi rebels, launched in response to the Israel-Gaza war amid an uneasy diplomatic climate in the Middle East. Economists have warned sustained disruption to shipping, or a wider conflict in the region involving Iran, or the closure of the Strait of Hormuz to shipping – a key route for shipments of oil and gas – could add significantly to global inflation. The UN said it was vital that governments avoided “self-defeating fiscal consolidations” and instead offered more financial support to stimulate economic growth at a time when central banks were keeping interest rates high. “In addition, global climate finance must be massively scaled up. Reducing – and eventually eliminating – fossil fuel subsidies, following through on international financing commitments, such as the $100bn pledge to support developing countries, and promoting technology transfer are critical for strengthening climate action worldwide,” it said."

        "content": "More than £1.8bn has been wiped off the value of JD Sports after the fashion retailer issued a profit warning saying that mild weather and heavy discounting had affected sales before Christmas. Shares in the retail group, which owns Go Outdoors, Blacks, Millets and Size? as well as the JD chain, dived by 23% after the company said it did not expect to make more than £935m in annual profits, 10% below its previous guidance. The drop in price to just below 120p a share – the lowest level in a year – made it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 on Thursday. Sports Direct owner Frasers Group also lost more than 3% of its value on fears that the sportswear market had been tougher than hoped, after Nike warned of poor sales before Christmas. Shares in other retailers selling clothing, including Marks & Spencer and N Brown Group, also took a hit. Analysts at Peel Hunt said that trading and profit margins had fallen below hopes in all of JD’s territories and that underlying sales had fallen in the UK, where a hoped-for “late surge” in demand “did not really emerge”. Jonathan Pritchard, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said: “External factors are mostly to blame here. The consumer is cautious and looking for a deal, and with no especially exciting [sports fashion product] launches, it has been a dullish period.” Last month Nike said sales for the year were likely to rise by only 1%, a more pessimistic view than its previous forecast of mid-single-digit percentage growth. The bestselling sportswear brand said it was cutting jobs and simplifying product ranges to concentrate on newer launches, which are proving more profitable than old favourites. Adidas also reported falling sales in November as it struggles to recover from the fallout from its once highly successful partnership with the rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, which ended after he made antisemitic comments on social media. Alice Price, an analyst at market research firm GlobalData, said the sportswear market in general was experiencing a slowdown and that JD’s focus on fashion rather than technical goods had made it more vulnerable to shoppers cutting spending on discretionary items. A high rate of inflation, particularly on sports footwear, in the past two years has made some think twice about buying the latest version of trendy trainers, while there have been fewer “it products” to grab shoppers’ attention. Price added that JD’s middle-market position and its core brands, such as Nike, were also under pressure as shoppers either moved towards premium specialist brands, such as Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Tala, some of which sell direct online, or high street own-labels such as M&S’s Goodmove. “They are struggling as people are trading up or down.” JD’s profit warning raises fears about a tough Christmas for fashion retailers after mild weather meant many people held off buying coats and knitwear – more expensive items that help deliver high profits in the final quarter of the year. Simon Wolfson, head of the fashion and homeware chain Next, which reported stronger than expected sales on Thursday, told the Guardian: “It didn’t feel to us there was a huge amount more discounting.” However, JD said there had been more than expected – suggesting different parts of the market may have been particularly vulnerable to heavy competition. Régis Schultz, chief executive of the JD Sports Fashion group, said: “Our key markets have seen increased promotional activity during the peak trading season, driven by a more cautious consumer, but we continue to grow market share. We are confident in our strategy and we continue to invest in our supply chain, systems and stores, supported by our strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet.”"

        "content": "Dutch flower growers have called on the UK government to delay post-Brexit border controls on plants and food set to come in from this month, claiming exporters are not ready and that any delays at customs could result in “substantial damages and losses”. VGB, the Dutch association of wholesalers in floricultural products, has written to the UK government warning it of “significant concerns” about industry readiness for the changes, saying they will cause disruption on Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day, the peak season for the sector.   Related: ‘We’re out of step’: how post-Brexit UK is drifting from EU standards   The checks, which make up part of a new post-Brexit border regime, will require European importers to provide health certificates for “medium and high risk” animal and plant products from 31 January, while physical inspections of these goods will start at the end of April. Chrysanthemums, carnations and orchids are among the flowers that will now need to be checked because they are classed as medium risk. Currently, officers visit garden centres after delivery, meaning plants can be cared for while they await inspection. After April, physical controls will happen at the port, meaning lorries and their consignments could be held for hours, putting perishable goods at risk. The Horticultural Trades Association chair, James Barnes, said Brexit had already introduced delays to imports, and that these could get worse under the new regime. He said the number of steps to import a petunia had increased from 19 to 59 since the UK left the EU: “You used to be able to pick up the telephone to a Dutch supplier and place an order of petunias and your goods would be with you on a lorry in 48 hours. “What will happen from the first of April, these checks will happen at the port rather than destination, and lorries will be stopped and opened and cause delay.”  Interactive  The introduction of extra import controls has already been delayed by the government on five occasions. But VGB is calling for a further grace period, with physical checks postponed until September 2025. It also wants a review of which flowers should be deemed high risk. In a summary of the letter shared with the Guardian, the VGB director, Matthijs Mesken, said: “We wish to express our concern regarding the impending introduction of phytosanitary certificates on medium-risk products, scheduled for 31 January 2024. “This timing coincides with the absolute peak of the seasons, which poses challenges for our industry.” He said that while only five types of flowers would be considered “medium risk”, these were present in nearly 85% of the shipped consignments due to mixed bouquets and would cause issues for Dutch exporters. The new certification in January will be followed by more stringent physical checks on products from 30 April. The letter said the April checks could mean delays in products getting to their destination, and could also lead to substantial damage to plants during border checks. Mesken said: “The introduction of [checks] … right in the midst of the planting season and just before the spring bank holiday raises additional concerns.” He explained that the considerable daily volumes passing the borders during this period coincided with the most vulnerable state of plants, during flowering, and would mean that any delays could result in “substantial damages and losses”. The government has said the border strategy was to “protect the UK against biosecurity threats” and the new controls would use “Brexit freedoms to simplify import controls on goods from across the globe”. However, VGB said that Britain currently boasted “Europe’s most efficient border”, and it was crucial this was maintained for the entire logistics network. VGB suggested the UK government push back physical checks of plant imports until at least September 2025.   Related: UK admits extra £330m a year in charges for post-Brexit animal and plant imports   There have been widespread concerns that the new checks could risk pushing up food and plant prices as importers are unable to absorb the new costs linked to the new checks. The Fresh Produce Consortium (FPC), an industry body that claims to speak for 70% of the UK’s fresh produce supply chain, estimated additional annual costs of more than £10m stemming from import charges would have to be passed on to consumers. A spokesperson at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The controls the border target operating model (BTOM) introduces are vital for keeping the UK safe by protecting our food supply chains and agricultural sector from disease outbreaks that would cause significant economic harm. The BTOM makes use of technology and data to make it simple for businesses to trade, limiting administrative burdens and keeping down costs. “We are working closely with stakeholders across all affected sectors within the UK, across the EU and with trading partners around the world to support readiness for the BTOM.”"

Next has upgraded profit hopes for the year after ringing up £38m more in sales than expected in the run-up to Christmas, but warned that difficulties in the Red Sea could delay deliveries and hit sales in the year ahead. The fashion and homeware chain said full-price sales had stepped up dramatically, rising by 10%, in the last two weeks before Christmas. As a result, sales rose by 5.7% in the nine weeks to 30 December, far better than the 2% expected. It is the fifth time in seven months that Next has increased its profit forecast.

The final reading for the US services business activity index from S&P Global rose to 51.4 in December from 40.8 in November, up slightly from the flash estimate of 51.3. Output increased at the fastest rate since July.  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:   Some New Year cheer is provided by the PMI signalling an acceleration of growth in the vast services economy, which reported its largest rise in output for five months in December. The improvement overshadows a downturn recorded in manufacturing to indicate that the overall pace of US economic growth likely accelerated slightly at the end of the year.  Some support to financial services in particular is coming from the recent loosening of financial conditions amid growing hopes of interest rate cuts in 2024. Growth nevertheless remains subdued by standards seen over the spring and summer, with the struggling manufacturing sector dampening demand for businessto-business services and consumers remaining far less inclined to spend on luxuries such as travel and recreation than earlier in the year.  The more challenging demand environment has dampened firms’ pricing power, squeezing service sector selling price inflation to the lowest for over three years on average during the fourth quarter. With sticky service sector inflation being a key area of concern among Fed policymakers, the slower rate of price increase in December is welcome news.      2.47pm GMT   After a year in which industry was knocked off its axis by the coming of age of artificial intelligence and the transition to an online world continued apace, new businesses are emerging and old industries reinventing themselves to adapt.

Related: From HumanForest to BrewDog: five firms to watch in a time of turbulence       2.42pm GMT   Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics, said the Houthi rebel attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea add to inflation risks in the UK.  We assume the disruption to shipping caused by maritime attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea will be relatively short-lived and the recent spike in sea freight prices will reverse. While there will be near-term impacts for some firms and sectors, these won’t be enough to shift our baseline economic or inflation forecasts to any meaningful extent. If the Red Sea were to remain closed to shipping for several months, however, and shipping freight costs stayed around twice the level of mid-December, this could add 0.7ppts to annual CPI inflation rates by the end of 2024. Still, the inflation push from this scenario wouldn’t be enough to stop world inflation from slowing over the course of this year and we doubt it would prevent the Fed and other major central banks from pivoting to rate cuts by around mid-2024. It would, however, be another reason to believe that the rate cuts priced in by markets have gone too far.      1.38pm GMT   More good news: the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time in the US totalled 202,000 in the week to 30 December – fewer than the 216,000 forecast by analysts.

This will benefit 120,000 people who are paid by the hour. Those in London will get £13.15 per hour. This is in line with the real living wage, which is voluntarily paid by more than 14,000 UK businesses. Sainsbury’s says it means it is the “largest supermarket to pay colleagues the new Real Living Wage nationally and the London Living Wage”. The pay rises will give workers an extra £1,910 a year nationally, and £2,290 a year in London. Sainsbury’s said it had also provided staff with free food during shifts in recent years, and increased staff discounts of 15% at Sasinsbury’s every Friday and Saturday and 15% at Argos (which it also owns) every payday.  Updated at 1.05pm GMT    12.44pm GMT  Next shares hit all-time high  Next enjoyed a 10% surge in sales in the two weeks before Christmas, and spoke of a “benign” consumer environment as it upped its profit outlook for the fifth time in seven months, raising hopes for the rest of the high street (sportswear retailers aside). As reported earlier, Next shares hit an all-time high of £85.32 and are now up 4.2% at £84.26, still the top FTSE 100 riser. Next, which owns other brands such as FatFace, Cath Kidston and Made.com, does not expect to have to put up prices in the year ahead as costs have remained steady. Next boss Simon Wolfson had hoped prices would drop this spring but he said they were now likely to hold steady because of the national minimum wage rise in April and problems in the Suez Canal which have driven up delivery costs. He said the attacks by Houthi rebels, which have forced container ships to travel around Africa rather than through the canal, could delay deliveries that might “moderate sales” if the disruption continued for a long period. “A lot will depend on how long this goes on for,” Wolfson said. “The extra sailing time eats into capacity in the network and we could begin to get constraints. At the moment it is an inconvenience not a crisis.”   Related: Next upgrades profits forecast amid bumper Christmas sales    Updated at 12.54pm GMT    12.33pm GMT   Here is our full story on JD Sports.

Sales rose 9.8% year-on-year in the three months to 30 November, driven by Black Friday which its website achieve its biggest ever month of sales in November and its biggest ever day of sales on Black Friday. Boots.com sales grew by 17.5% and contributed nearly a fifth of the total. The Boots app now has 7.2m active members. Store sales were also strong, up by more than 7% in Black Friday week. Electrical items, beauty and skincare, the No7 range and perfumes were the top performing categories, with a bottle of fragrance sold every second of Black Friday week. Flagship stores and shops in travel locations performed particularly well. Beauty sales were up by 11.4% for the quarter, driven by continued strong performance of skincare and premium beauty. Haircare saw sales growth of 10% bolstered by the launch of ten professional and salon haircare brands on the website, while the No7 skincare range posted sales growth of more than 13%. The chain also administered more than 1m flu vaccinations in the quarter. Boots will report on its Christmas sales later in the year but the signs are that it had a strong festive period.  Updated at 12.56pm GMT    12.11pm GMT   The rise in November mortgage approvals to a five-month high points to a pickup in the housing market, as mortgage rates come down amid a price war among lenders, and expectations that the Bank of England will start cutting interest rates soon. Noble Francis, economics Director at the Construction Products Association and honorary professor at the UCL Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, tweeted:  There were 50,067 mortgage approvals in the UK in November 2023 according to the Bank of England, 4.6% higher than in October & 9.9% higher than a year earlier (during the post-Mini Budget spike in mortgage rates & slump in mortgage approvals). (1/n)#ukhousing #housing pic.twitter.com/1mgaf2ZwuJ— Noble Francis (@NobleFrancis) January 4, 2024  Independent economist Shaun Richards tweeted:  The Bank of England will be pleased by the falls in UK mortgage rates https://t.co/06eywLLzkK— Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) January 4, 2024      10.52am GMT   Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club forecasting group, has looked at the Bank of England figures. The number of mortgages approved in November was 50,067, up from 47,888 the previous month and the highest since June 2023. Net mortgage lending flatlined in November, little different from October’s £100m decline. Beck said:  A second successive monthly rise in mortgage approvals in November, albeit from a very low level, was likely helped by the decline in quoted mortgage rates which began last summer… The lag between mortgages being approved and loans dispensed means that the recent pickup in activity should push net lending back into positive territory in the first quarter. Investors’ recent reappraisal of the outlook for interest rates means prospects for mortgage lending have strengthened. Swap rates, which influence the cost of fixed-rate mortgages, fell over November and December, adding to declines earlier last year. This is feeding through to quoted mortgage rates. Provided that the Bank of England fulfils market expectations (the EY ITEM Club thinks the Bank of England will start loosening policy in May and cut rates by 125bps in 2024), then mortgage rates should remain at these lower levels. This should reduce the scale of the unaffordability challenge and reduce the odds of house prices falling further.  Turning to consumer borrowing via credit cards and personal loans, which rose to the highest level since March 2017, he said:  An increase in gross lending, mainly via credit cards, accounted for the bulk of the net rise. If November’s unexpectedly strong increase in lending is maintained, this could present an upside for consumer spending growth this year.   Updated at 12.55pm GMT    10.44am GMT   Contrasting with the upturn in Spain’s service industries, Italy’s service sector remained in decline in December, extending its period of contraction to five months.  However, it improved and was close to moving back into growth, with the headline PMI moving up to 49.8 in December from 49.5 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction; any reading above points to expansion Output fell for a fifth month and new orders continued to fall. Although firms saw cost inflation cool to a 32-month low in December, output prices increased at a quicker pace. The final reading from the sister survey for Germany showed its services firms continued to shrink in December, with the headline index at 49.3, a two-month low.  In France, there was a further solid reduction in output across its service sector, with the final reading at 45.4.     10.28am GMT  Inflation up in German states  Over in Germany, inflation picked up in a number of big states in December, suggesting a bumpy road ahead for national price rises. The annual inflation rate in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, rose to 3.5% in December from 3% the previous month. In Bavaria, inflation rose to 3.45 from 2.8%; in Brandenburg, it picked up to 4.5% from 4.1%, in Saxony to 4.3% from 3.9%; in Baden-Württemberg to 3.5% from 3.4% and in Hessen to 3.5% from 2.9%. This is because of the annual comparison, as there were energy relief measures for gas and heating in December 2022. Inflation had been slowing in previous months.  Economists are forecasting a rise in German inflation to 3.8% in December, from 2.3% in November.     9.54am GMT  UK mortgage approvals pick up, credit card borrowing doubles  Mortgage approvals in the UK picked up in November, while credit card borrowing doubled to £1bn, according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals for house purchases – an indicator of future borrowing – rose to 50,100 in November from 47,900 in October, while approvals of remortgaging increased to 27,000 from 24,000. While approvals rose to the highest level since June, they remained below the long-term average. Mortgage lending to individuals was zero compared to £100m of net repayments in October. This chimes with other signs that the housing market is picking up, although experts are still predicting further price falls this year.   Related: Britain’s housing market may be ‘past peak pain’ but what will 2024 bring?   The Bank of England figures also showed that net consumer credit borrowing rose to a near-seven-year high of £2bn in November from £1.4bn in October, as people borrowed more on credit cards, with that borrowing doubling to £1bn.  Updated at 10.07am GMT    9.44am GMT   This contrasts with the eurozone, where business activity shrank last month, pointing to recession, according to a sister survey. Hamburg Commercial Bank’s PMI, compiled by S&P Global and seen as a good gauge of the economy, was revised higher but remained in negative territory. The headline index was 47.6, the same as in November, indicating contraction (any reading below 50 points to contraction; any reading above to expansion). This suggests that the 20-nation currency bloc, which shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter of last year, contracted again in the fourth quarter, which would put it in recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.  Updated at 12.54pm GMT    9.36am GMT  UK services activity stronger than thought  Britain’s service sector grew at a brisker pace in December than previously thought and optimism among firms hit a seven-month high, according to a survey. The findings will be welcomed by Rishi Sunak who is expected to call a general election this year. Official data published last month suggested the economy could already be in a mild recession. The final headline reading from the S&P Global/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index was 53.4 in December, the highest since June. It was up from 40.9 in November and a preliminary reading of 52.7. Firms’ optimism regarding the outlook for 2024 improved for the second month in a row to its highest since last May, driven by hopes of a sustained turnaround in client demand. The composite PMI, which combines the services survey with a weak reading of the manufacturing sector published on Tuesday, rose to 52.1 in December, the highest since May, and compared with 50.7 in November.  Updated at 9.38am GMT    9.03am GMT  Next boss warns Suez Canal disruption could lead to slower sales  The Next boss Simon Wolfson has warned that disruption to shipments through the Suez Canal could lead to slower sales growth this year. If attacks by Iran-backed Yemeni Houthi militants in the Red Sea continue throughout 2024, the clothing and homewares retailer’s sales growth would be affected, he said. He told Reuters:  It will be a factor. If it continues, it will moderate sales growth in that we’ll have slightly less stock in the country than we would like.  After a stellar Christmas performance, Next is still at the top of the FTSE 100 with the shares up 4.8% to a record peak. JD Sports, on the other hand, which warned on profits this morning, is at the bottom of the index with the shares falling 23%. JD is on track for a record daily fall, as the share price fall wiped nearly £2bn off its market value.  Updated at 9.39am GMT    8.30am GMT  Spain's services upturn picks up in December  The recent upturn in Spain’s service industries continued last month, with activity rising modestly for a fourth month in a row – perhaps because mild weather has lured Spaniards to the beaches, boosting spending. A closely watched survey from Hamburg Commercial Bank showed the headline services PMI (purchasing managers’ index) at 51.5, up from 51 in November, signalling the highest growth since July. This was better than economists had expected. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:   In contrast to the overall economic weakness in Europe, Spain’s service sector appears to be charting its own course. Rather than succumbing to the broader economic downturn, service providers in Spain are still on an expansion trajectory. While it is far away from a full-blown boom, the resilience is surprising, especially considering the subdued mood in the manufacturing sector and the lacklustre performance of the service sector in other parts of the eurozone.  This noteworthy performance may be attributed to two key factors: the new government’s commitment to extend measures supporting private households and, secondly, the warm temperatures in recent weeks possibly inspiring residents of Spain to head to the beaches, leading to increased spending.      8.18am GMT   In France, inflation picked up slightly in December on the back of higher prices for energy and services. A preliminary estimate from the national statistics office INSEE showed annual inflation rose to 4.1% from 3.9% in November, in line with economists’ forecasts. Food price inflation slowed to 7.1% from 7.7% but energy prices rose by 5.6% year on year, faster than the 3.1% in November. Services inflation accelerated to 3.1% from 2.8%.

Martin told City A.M that people have “always overindulged at Christmas and then tried to compensate in January”.  To an extent Dry January has just given a name to what happened anyway. But perhaps it is turning into a minor cult, even so. Overall, I’m not sure that pubs can legitimately advise people to start drinking in January if they don’t want to.

Points to UK GDP in Q4 recovering from a soggy October— Simon French (@shjfrench) January 4, 2024      7.47am GMT   Charlie Huggins, manager of the ‘Quality Shares Portfolio’ at Wealth Club, who owns shares in Next, said:  Next has pulled yet another rabbit out of the hat today, leading to a further upgrade to its full-year sales and profit guidance. It has demonstrated once again why it is considered one of the best run retailers around. UK consumer spending appears to have defied gravity. A strong employment market and rising wages have helped cushion inflationary cost pressures, meaning consumers have continued to fill their Christmas stockings with Next’s wares, despite the gloomy economic headlines. Next’s online sales were particularly strong reflecting better stock availability and excellent operational execution. This stands in stark contrast to other retailers like Superdry which have struggled in the prevailing economic environment. The future for Next looks bright and is reflected in the group’s guidance to grow sales and profits again in the year ahead. Next’s core proposition is clearly resonating with the UK consumer and is being augmented by intelligent acquisitions of brands like Fat Face. With inflation falling and wages rising, the economic picture also looks a lot less bleak than at the start of last year.   Updated at 8.23am GMT    7.45am GMT   Next said it had done especially well online after improving its service. Online sales rose by 9.1% in the three months to the end of December following a decline in the previous three months. Retail analyst Richard Lim added:  Their online sales were the driving force this Christmas but it was only made possible with the evolving value of their stores. Click and collect, showcasing products in shops, and returns to stores are all critical requirements for an increasing number of consumers. Their clever acquisitions over the last few years are also beginning to reap rewards.  Next has been on a buying spree and recently acquired the casual clothing chain FatFace. It also snapped up Cath Kidston, the online furniture retailer Made.com and JoJo Maman Bébé since the height of the Covid pandemic.  Updated at 8.24am GMT    7.39am GMT  Introduction: Next raises profit forecast after Christmas sales surge; JD warns on profits  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK clothing chain Next has raised its profit forecast for the fifth time in seven months, as it reported better-than-expected sales for the Christmas period, while JD Sports Fashion blamed warm weather for a worse-than-expected performance and warned on profits. The fashion and homewares retailer said sales rose by 5.7% year-on-year in the nine weeks to 30 December, better than its previous estimate of 2% growth. In the last two weeks before Christmas, sales jumped by 10%. It upgraded its profit before tax estimate by £20m to £095m, up by 4% from last year. Of that, £17m came from the sales beat so far and £3m from an upgraded sales forecast for January. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, said:  These figures are astonishingly strong and they will set them apart from the competition. There’s a gap emerging between those retailers who have invested heavily in their digital proposition over the last decade with those who have not and Next is leading the pack.  Next went into the end of season sale with 12% less stock than last year. The retailer said:  On the face of it, the consumer environment looks more benign than it has for a number of years, albeit there are some significant uncertainties.  Next pointed to wages rising in line with, not more than, inflation, but said it does not intend to raise its selling prices in the year ahead. Risks include a weakening employment market, as vacancy rates in the UK have already fallen over the last six months, and if this continues, is likely to result in increased unemployment. Fixed-rate mortgage deals will continue to expire forcing homeowners to refinance at much higher rates than they have been used to in recent years. Next also mentioned that difficulties with access to the Suez canal (caused by Houthi attacks in the Red Sea), if they continue, are likely to cause some delays to stock deliveries in the early part of the year. The largest cost increase will be wage inflation, estimated to be about £60m, due to inflation and the rise in the national living wage. The sports retailer JD Sports didn’t fare as well, and blamed milder weather and a glut of promotions in the sports market. Like-for-like sales rose by 1.8% in the 22 weeks to 30 December, behind its expectations, while total revenue growth was 6%. It lowered its estimate for profit before tax and adjusted items to between £915m and £935m, 10% below its previous guidance of £1.04bn. Its new chief executive Régis Schultz said:  We have made good progress against our five-year strategic plan, delivering global organic revenue growth of 6% in the period, against very tough comparisons with last year, and opening over 200 new JD stores in the year. Our key markets have seen increased promotional activity during the peak trading season, driven by a more cautious consumer, but we continue to grow market share.

        "content": "Germany’s emissions hit a 70-year low last year as Europe’s largest economy reduced its reliance on coal. A study by the thinktank Agora Energiewende found that Germany emitted 673m tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, 73m tonnes fewer than in 2022. The drop was “largely attributable to a strong decrease in coal power generation”, Agora said, accounting for a reduction of 46m tonnes in CO2 emissions. Emissions from industry fell significantly, largely due to a decline in production by energy-intensive companies. Electricity generation from renewable sources was more than 50% of the total in 2023 for the first time, while coal’s share dropped to 26% from 34%, according to the federal network agency. Germany had resorted to coal following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow cut off gas supplies. But since then Germany has significantly reduced its use of the fossil fuels. Simon Müller, the director of Agora, said the renewables record brought Germany in line with its target to produce 80% of its electricity from wind and solar by 2030. Despite this fall in coal reliance, the thinktank said, “most of the emissions cuts in 2023 are not sustainable from an industrial or climate policy perspective”. Müller said: “The crisis-related slump in production weakens the German economy. If emissions are subsequently relocated abroad, then nothing has been achieved for the climate.”  In all, the thinktank estimated only 15% of the reduction in 2023 constituted “permanent emissions savings”. To hit its climate targets, Germany needed a “barrage of investments” to modernise industry and reduce the carbon footprint from heating, Müller said."

The fashion and homeware chain said full-price sales had stepped up dramatically, rising by 10%, in the last two weeks before Christmas. As a result, sales rose by 5.7% in the nine weeks to 30 December, far better than the 2% expected. It is the fifth time in seven months that Next has increased its profit forecast. Next does not expect to have to put up prices in the year ahead as costs have remained steady.

He said the attacks by Houthi rebels, which have forced container ships to travel around Africa rather than through the canal, could delay deliveries, which may “moderate sales” if the disruption continued for a long period. “A lot will depend on how long this goes on for,” Wolfson said. “The extra sailing time eats into capacity in the network and we could begin to get constraints. At the moment it is an inconvenience not a crisis.”  Next said it had performed particularly well online after it improved its service, with sales rising by 9.1% in the three months to the end of December. Sales in stores rose by 0.6% after a fall in the previous quarter. The retailer said it now expected to make full-year profits of £905m, £20m more than previously hoped. Lord Wolfson said the company had traded better than expected because it had underestimated the effect of online service improvements after last year, when deliveries were affected by an “extremely congested” warehouse and the Royal Mail strikes. Richard Lim, the chief executive of analysts Retail Economics, said: “These figures are astonishingly strong and they will set them apart from the competition. There’s a gap emerging between those retailers who have invested heavily in their digital proposition over the last decade with those who have not and Next is leading the pack.” Next’s share price rose by almost 5% on Thursday – hitting an all-time high of £85.32 - as the company said it expected full-price sales to rise by 2.5% in the year ahead and up by 6% in total, including new brands such as Gap and Reiss and discounted goods. Wolfson said the year ahead was “looking like a more normal year” after three years of the pandemic followed by the cost of living crisis, with wage inflation now running ahead of price inflation. “On the flip side, inflation in wages may impact employment,” he said. The stronger-than-expected trading figures will lift hopes for other retailers for the festive season, when shoppers had been expected to cut back on buying clothing amid tight household budgets and renewed interest in travel. The chemist and beauty chain Boots on Thursday revealed it had also had a strong autumn and Christmas period, reflecting a good season for beauty products in 2023. The company said sales rose 9.8% in the three months to 30 November led by a 17.5% rise in online sales and strong beauty sales – up 11.4%. The company said Black Friday on 24 November was Boots’s biggest ever day of sales, with one bottle of fragrance sold every second. The company will not report on Christmas trading until later this year but said: “Early indications suggest a strong Christmas period with sales from Black Friday week until the new year beating last year’s excellent performance.” However, the upbeat mood was offset by a profit warning from JD Sports which said mild weather in the early autumn and higher-than-expected levels of discounting in the run-up to Christmas had both hit sales."

        "content": "Britain’s housing market is “past peak pain”, the upmarket estate agent Savills has said. The big mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide building society have recorded monthly house price gains in recent months, which have taken some by surprise. But that does not mean the annual declines in property prices are over. Just over 60% of households (about 16 million) own their homes in England and Wales, but property has been an engine of economic growth since the financial crisis ushered in an era of low interest rates, with the wealth it creates fuelling spending on goods and services. When house prices rise – or fall – there is an economic ripple effect. So what will 2024 bring for the all-important housing market, and which geographic areas are likely to attract the most interest from buyers? The forecast from lenders and estate agents is mixed: 2024 is set to be a second year of falling house prices in the UK, with values expected to drop by up to 4% year on year, despite a likely recovery in the second half underpinned by lower borrowing costs as the Bank of England begins to reverse its long cycle of rate increases. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, says: “People are becoming a little bit more optimistic. It’s still going to be difficult for households but hopefully the squeeze on incomes will continue to lessen because growth is outpacing inflation.” Coupled with lower mortgage rates, affordability should improve, although this would take time, he adds. “Affordability is still stretched.” A few days into the new year, HSBC has become the latest high street lender to lower its mortgage deals, and brokers predict the price war among lenders will continue. At the same time, with the economy on the brink of recession and with the ongoing cost of living pressures, and sharply higher interest rates than in recent years, many people, particularly first-time buyers, will still struggle to buy a home in the coming months. In 2023, UK house prices fell by 1.8%, according to Nationwide; the drop was much smaller drop than expected at the start of last year, when experts forecast declines of between 5% and 12%. Mortgage approvals fell by a quarter last year and housing transactions fell by nearly a fifth; both figures are the lowest in at least a decade. Most regions of the UK posted falls apart from Northern Ireland, where prices rose by 4.5%, and Scotland, up by 0.5%. Most property companies are predicting further small declines in 2024, ranging from a flat outcome to a 4% drop, followed by a return to growth in 2025. Knight Frank expects prices to fall by 4% in 2024, less than the 5% it forecast earlier, as the economy stabilises and attention turns to when the first interest rate cut will come. Lower-than-expected inflation has fuelled expectations of a series of rate cuts next year. The City is expecting as many as six quarter-point cuts, taking the Bank of England’s base rate from 5.25% to about 3.75% by the end of 2024. Financial markets are betting that the first reduction will come by May. Many lenders have already started trimming their mortgage rates, to an average of 5.92% for a two-year fix and 5.53% for a five-year fix, according to Moneyfacts. Intensifying competition meant many would-be buyers could get much better deals than those headline rates. The mortgage lender John Charcol says: “Lenders will be looking to capitalise on the pent-up purchase demand and those coming to the end of their fixed rate in the first half of 2024, so we should expect to see continuous battle amongst lenders.”  Interactive  Halifax is expecting house prices to fall between 2% and 4% in 2024, and Nationwide says they could be flat or fall by a small single-digit figure. Savills and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) are predicting a drop of 3%, while the property websites Zoopla and Rightmove have predicted drops of 2% and 1%. JLL explains that price falls earlier in the year would outweigh any increases in the second half, meaning single-digit annual falls by the end of 2024. Frances McDonald, a director in Savills’ residential research team, says: “We’re expecting the housing market to bottom out in the first half of 2024, because that’s when you begin to see more meaningful cuts to lending costs on the back of Bank base rate cuts.” About 1.5 million homeowners will come to the end of their fixed-rate mortgage deals this year, and many will have to refinance at much higher rates than they have been used to in recent years. Last year, 1.6m fixed-rate deals expired, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. So far, the market downturn has not been as severe as expected. Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says: “Price declines have not been as steep as forecast in most residential markets. Low transaction volumes may skew the numbers but there are other factors supporting prices. “A strong jobs market, the availability of longer mortgages, the fact more homes are owned outright than with a mortgage (35% versus 29% according to the latest English Housing Survey) and the absence of forced selling due to tighter mortgage stress-testing rules since the global financial crisis have all helped avoid steeper declines.” This year, forecast price falls will be steepest in London, the south-east and east, down between 3.5% and 4%, while the north-east, Scotland, Wales and West Midlands are set to post the smallest declines: between 1.5% and 2%, according to Savills’ projections. Among the towns and cities that have done well is Huddersfield, where house prices rose 8.7% last year, adding £22,137 to the average price of a home, according to Halifax. Bradford came second with 8.5% growth, followed by Falkirk in Scotland with 6% growth, and Hillingdon in London, where property values rose 4.5%.  Interactive  McDonald says: “Lender forbearance has been much better than we’ve seen during previous downturns” and that there had not been a surge in forced sales. Under the government’s mortgage charter, struggling mortgage holders are given a 12-month grace period before their home is repossessed as well as the option to switch to interest-only payments. She says the wider economic picture should help, with a healthy jobs market meaning borrowers could keep up with repayments. “Unemployment isn’t expected to increase very much and that’s why we’re not forecasting any more significant falls.”"

        "content": "The bosses of Britain’s biggest companies will have made more money in 2024 by Thursday lunchtime than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year, according to analysis of vast pay gaps amid strike action and the cost of living crisis. The High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said that by 1pm on the third working day of the year, a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than a UK worker’s annual salary of £34,963, based on median average remuneration figures for both groups. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, the umbrella body for UK trade unions, said: “While working people have been forced to suffer the longest wage squeeze in modern history, City bosses have been allowed to pocket bumper rises and bankers have been given unlimited bonuses.” Nowak blamed politicians for allowing the gap between bosses’ and workers’ pay to increase. “The Conservatives are presiding over – and enabling – obscene levels of pay inequality,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We need an economy that rewards work – not just wealth.   Related: UK financial regulators scrap cap on bankers’ bonuses   “That means putting workers on company boards to inject some much-needed common sense into boardrooms. It means taxing wealth fairly. And it means a government that is willing to work with unions and employers to drive up living standards for all.” The average pay of CEOs has increased by 9.5% since March 2023, while workers’ median pay has increased by 6%. The average pay of FTSE 100 CEOs dropped slightly during the pandemic, but has since increased by about a quarter. Some City figures have called for UK CEOs to be given big uplifts in pay in order to compete with the amounts paid to the bosses of US firms. Legal & General Investment Management, one of the largest UK pension and insurance firms, last month called for “necessary flexibility” in pay in order to attract the best talent with “remunerations structures that are more closely aligned to US-style pay”. The High Pay Centre also calculated how long it would take for other top earners to surpass the median UK worker’s full-time earnings:  Other FTSE 350 executives (comprising FTSE 100 executives other than the CEO, plus CEOs and other executives of FTSE 250 companies) earn an average of £1.3m, so would only need to work until 10 January for their pay to overtake the average worker. Partners at so-called “magic circle” law firms earn an average of £1.9m, so would need to work until 8 January to do the same. Partners at the “big four” accountancy firms have an average pay of £870,000, so would need to work until 16 January. Top bankers (so-called “material risk takers”) at the UK’s five biggest banks earn £807,000 on average, and will also overtake average workers by 16 January. Everyone in the top 1% of full-time UK earners earns at least £145,000, so will overtake average median full-time worker by 29 March.  Last year the government scrapped an EU rule capping the bonuses of bankers at 100% of salary, a measure that had been introduced in 2014 with the aim of avoiding another banking crisis. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, said: “Lobbyists for big business and the financial services industry spent much of 2023 arguing that top earners in Britain aren’t paid enough and that we are too concerned with gaps between the super-rich and everybody else. They think that economic success is created by a tiny number of people at the top and that everybody else has very little to contribute. “When politicians listen to these misguided views, it’s unsurprising that we end up with massive inequality, and stagnating living standards for the majority of the population.” Laurence Turner, the GMB union’s head of research and policy, said: “The widening pay inequality at work is bad for businesses and bad for the economy. “Instead, of channelling profits to those at the top, we need a sustainable recovery with more money in working people’s pockets.”"

        "content": "The Liberal Democrat leader has accused Post Office bosses of misleading him over the Horizon IT scandal in which hundreds of branch owner-operators were wrongly prosecuted. Sir Ed Davey, who was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012 when the software issues started coming to light, said he regretted not doing more to help victims who were wrongly accused of stealing but claimed that executives had blocked him from meeting campaigners. Speaking to Times Radio, he said: “I feel that I was deeply misled by Post Office executives … they didn’t come clean. There were definitely attempts to stop me meeting [campaigners]. “We were clearly misled. I think ministers from all political parties were misled.” On Monday, ITV began broadcasting Mr Bates vs the Post Office, a four-part drama charting the fight for justice by branch owner-operators wrongly prosecuted because of faults in the Horizon computer system being used to help with accounting. Alan Bates, who is played by Toby Jones in the drama, said that in 2010 he approached Davey, then postal affairs minister, but the MP said he did not believe a meeting “would serve any purpose”. This week, Davey said Post Office executives were now “dragging their feet” and “not bringing evidence to the inquiry”. He added: “Government ministers need to do more – I hope they watch this series and realise they’ve got to come forward with a proper compensation package.” On Wednesday, Post Office workers wrongly accused of stealing as a result of the Horizon faults said many were still waiting for compensation four years after winning a court case proving their innocence. Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office relentlessly pursued branch owner-operators across the UK for alleged theft, fraud and false accounting, despite knowing there were faults in Horizon IT software they were using, resulting in more than 700 prosecutions. The scandal has often been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. In 2019, a group of Post Office operators won a high court case in which their convictions were ruled wrongful. That was after a prosecution process that had ruined lives and had been linked to four suicides. Dozens of victims have died without receiving compensation. “Some have been waiting over 20 years and suffering for far too long,” Bates told the Mirror. “It’s money they are owed. Don’t extend the deadline for payments because you can’t extend people’s lives.” Noel Thomas, who was sentenced to nine months in prison in 2006 but whose conviction was quashed in 2021, said: “I might never see [full compensation] because a lot of my friends have gone. A lot of people I met from this process have passed away.” Others have told heartbreaking stories about the financial and personal ramifications of being prosecuted and convicted to the public inquiry into the scandal. Siobhan Sayer was separated from her distressed six-month-old daughter when investigators visited her home in 2008 seeking £18,000 in funds missing from her Post Office business. Pauline Thomson, who ultimately avoided jail, spoke of how she was sentenced on the day her granddaughter was born. Lee Castleton, who called the Post Office’s helpline 91 times as he suspected the Horizon IT system was at fault, had to represent himself in court as he could not afford a lawyer and was made bankrupt after a two-year legal effort to clear his name. A member of the Post Office’s legal team told the inquiry that it knew Castleton would not be able to pay costs of £321,000 if he lost but the state-owned company wanted to “show the world” it would defend the Horizon system. The 2019 ruling paved the way for millions of pounds of future payouts, and led to the court of appeal quashing the convictions of workers who were wrongly accused of committing crimes. However, there have been concerns about delays to the payments and further blunders, including tax being charged on the compensation. By last month, 142 appeal case reviews had been completed out of 900 people convicted during the scandal, with 93 convictions overturned and 54 upheld, withdrawn or refused permission to appeal. A total of £24m has been paid out in relation to overturned convictions. In September, ministers announced that every branch owner-operator whose wrongful conviction had been overturned would receive £600,000 in compensation from the government. The overturned convictions process is one of three different compensation schemes that have been set up as the scandal has developed. More than £130m has so far been paid to about 2,500 Post Office workers across the three schemes. However, last month it emerged that the Post Office had almost halved the amount set aside for payouts as fewer owner-operators than expected had won or brought appeals. The Post Office said in its annual results covering the year to the end of March that it was now holding £244m for compensation payments, down from £487m a year ago, after 38% of appeals against convictions were either turned down, withdrawn or unsuccessful. A Post Office spokesperson said: “We’re acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and we’re doing all we can to provide redress both in respect of paying compensation and assisting the Horizon IT Inquiry. The inquiry was set up to establish independently what went wrong in the past and accountability for it. It would be inappropriate to comment separately from the proceedings of the inquiry.”"

        "content": "“We continue to view Thames Water as a long-term investment,” said the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the £75bn pension fund for UK academics, as it wrote down the value of its stake in the Thames’ parent by nearly two-thirds, or almost £600m. Top marks for cheerfulness, but it’s a line that recalls the old joke about the definition of a long-term investment: a short-term investment gone wrong. USS and Canadian pension fund Omers, the other late arrival on Thames’ register in 2017 (they replaced the departing Macquarie and its co-travellers), surely cannot have imagined that the long term would stretch quite so far over the horizon. As USS says, it’s taken no dividends so far, and the current business plan imagines no income for shareholders until 2030 at the earliest. That’s a near-eternity in investment terms for utility assets, which are supposedly prized for their ability to generate steady cash. “What could investors have known beforehand?” asked a paper published on Wednesday by Edhec Infra, a research institute and data provider. Quite a lot, it concludes, noting three “red flags”. First, what it calls “twisted” regulated incentives encouraged overborrowing. Second, there was so much debt in Thames that it “should have been clear from 2016 onwards” that there would be no payouts for many years. Third, a combination of high debts and underinvestment meant Thames had become more risky than its peers: underperformance, high costs and fines would happen “sooner or later”. USS and Omers might reasonably argue that Edhec Infra’s analysis is written with the benefit of hindsight. That’s true. And it’s also the case that the regulatory system re-sets every five years, with new allocations made for capital costs, bills, capital expenditure and so on. So any backward-looking analysis uses data that couldn’t have been assumed at the time. And it’s fair to day that higher energy costs and inflation haven’t helped in the past two years. All the same, the researchers are surely right on the basic point: buying out Macquarie, circa 2017, was a high-risk punt even at the time. Public anger with water companies and the state of the waterways was already intense. The Ofwat chair of the day, Jonson Cox, was venting his feelings by writing open letters calling for “a step change” in the way Thames “operates and behaves”. Regulatory run-ins and court cases were becoming more common, including one where a judge whacked Thames after a major spillage of raw sewage and said: “It should not be cheaper to offend than to take appropriate precautions.” In short, the tide was already turning in 2017. That is why it is hard to muster any sympathy for the late-arriving shareholders. Yes, a lot of damage was done in the decade of dividend extraction under Macquarie’s ownership, as is widely recognised, but the 2017 vintage entered with their eyes open, or should have done. It looks as if they simply overpaid and underestimated the effort and catch-up investment required. Not every water company is in a Thames-like mess. One can also speculate, as Edhec Infra’s analysts don’t, as to whether Thames’s fragmented ownership has been a factor. Omers, with 32%, and USS, with 20%, are the biggest shareholders, but the cast also takes in the governments of Abu Dhabi (10%) and China (9%), the manager of BT’s pension fund (9%) and a second Canadian fund (9%). It makes for a bloated 15-strong board at the level of Kemble Water, the parent. Six of the 15, according to the last accounts, also have “alternative directors to represent them when they are unavailable”. USS itself – on its home patch and more publicly associated with Thames – may be active and engaged. But the structure as a whole smacks of control by investment committees scattered around the globe, which is not obviously a formula for dynamism in a crisis. After the writedowns, the next challenge for the investors is whether to commit more capital, a question that will hinge in large part on whether Ofwat will accept a series of exceptional demands in Thames’ proposed business plan, including relief from fines and a 40% hike in customers’ bills. Given the recent history – pre and post-2017 – there is no reason for Ofwat to be generous."

        "content": "Eurostar has been censured by the advertising watchdog after misleading potential customers over the cost of seats during its sale last summer. The Advertising Standards Authority found the train operator had breached rules around misleading advertising and prices after its adverts claimed that customers could secure trips to Paris, Brussels and Lille “from just £39 each way”. It concluded that only a “very small percentage” of tickets were available at that price and has warned Eurostar not to make such price claims in the future. The judgment comes after a torrid festive period for the operator, when services were hit by mass cancellations caused by staff strikes, and a burst pipe led to flooding of a tunnel under the Thames. The complaint to the ASA was raised by a customer after they were only able to find one ticket from London to Paris at the advertised price. The body of the promotional email, which was sent last July, called on travellers to “soak up every second of summer”, while large text in the body of the email said: “TREAT YOURSELF TO A EUROPEAN GETAWAY … FROM JUST £39 EACH WAY.” When approached by the ASA, Eurostar said 39,000 seats had been available at the advertised price at the time the email was sent and this was clearly stated in the terms and conditions at the bottom of the text. It said that while it did not know when the complainant had searched for a ticket, the number of tickets available at the price would have decreased as more were sold. Eurostar added that the email clearly stated that tickets were subject to availability and it had received no direct complaints from customers about the promotion. After analysing data sent from Eurostar, the ASA judged that the rail operator had been unable to demonstrate that a “significant proportion” of tickets between London to Paris had been available “from” £39 during the promotional period. When the promotion was launched only 9,500 standard class seats had been available at that price. Similarly low percentages of tickets between London and Brussels and Lille had been available at that price.   Related: ‘Not what I had in mind’: Eurostar cancellations leave thousands stranded   The ASA concluded: “Because we considered that a significant proportion of tickets had not been available at the “from” price, we concluded that the claim ‘treat yourself to a European getaway from just £39 each way […] with a summer getaway in August or September’ was therefore misleading.” On Saturday, thousands of travellers were left stranded when more than 40 Eurostar services in and out of London were cancelled after flooding in a tunnel on the line caused chaos. Pre-Christmas travel to and from the continent was also severely affected after an unexpected strike by Eurotunnel workers forced Eurostar to cancel most of its trains on 21 December. Commenting on the ASA ruling, a Eurostar spokesperson said: “We value customer feedback, including complaints and take great care in the way that we word our advertising and the number of tickets that we offer at the promotional price during particular time periods. “We understand and take onboard the ASA’s ruling which is related to seat availability in part of the promotional period, and we are committed to ensuring that this scenario does not occur again.” • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. Recent flooding of a tunnel under the Thames was caused by a burst pipe, not bad weather as an earlier version said. "

        "content": "One of the world’s largest insurance companies has been forced to pay thousands of pounds in interest to small businesses whose Covid insurance payout claims were delayed. The QBE Group’s initial payout just before Christmas of more than £386,000 to 86 companies raises the potential for a total outlay by insurers of up to £1.6bn in interest to customers, it is claimed. About 60 insurers have been accused of unfairly delaying making payouts on business interruption policies to 370,000 small businesses, from restaurants and bars to hairdressers and guesthouses. Last year, the UK’s financial ombudsman ruled that an 8% annual rate of interest should be paid on the sum, pro rata, roughly covering the period between the claim being declined and it being actually paid. The payment by the QBE Group of £386,215 to the clients of the loss assessor is said to be a key step towards thousands more businesses receiving similar payouts. Jeff Salmon, chief executive of Salmon Assessors, said his clients had suffered two years of injustice and that others should come forward to make claims. “To say this was a ‘David and Goliath scenario’ is an understatement,” he said. “It was an uphill slog, with the insurers seemingly purposely procrastinating every step of the way.” About 370,000 small businesses made insurance claims after the coronavirus lockdowns left them unable to trade. Many of those policyholders had their claims initially declined on the grounds that the business interruption policies were not designed to cover a government-imposed lockdown. In 2020, the high court found in favour of policyholders after the Financial Conduct Authority brought a test case to court, but six of the eight insurers named in the case, Arch Insurance, Argenta, Hiscox, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA, appealed. It was not until the supreme court ruled in the policyholders’ favour in 2021 that some claims were paid out. Businesses then sought compensation for the delays in payments. In a key case, the financial ombudsman ruled that a dental practice whose claim had been initially declined but later approved should be paid interest by its insurer, QBE. The company had subsequently sought further clarification of the ruling but paid up just before Christmas. Salmon said that every policyholder should now claim interest from their insurance company if the claim was delayed. With QBE paying out £4,500 on average in interest to each claimant, the total potential cost to the insurance industry was said by Salmon to be more than £1.6bn. A spokesperson for QBE said: “Covid-19 business interruption claims can be very complex. As such, the claims handling process is sometimes unavoidably lengthened. Naturally, QBE always ensures that we comply with all our regulatory and legal obligations related to these claims, that we consider our customers’ particular circumstances and that we handle the claims in as timely a manner as possible.”"

Inflation is now at its lowest level since April 2022, but many consumers are still feeling the pinch. Prices for sweets, eggs and frozen potato products rose fastest but prices fell for dairy items, including butter, milk and cream.

Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office relentlessly pursued branch owner-operators across the UK for alleged theft, fraud and false accounting, despite knowing that there were faults in Horizon IT software they were using, resulting in more than 700 prosecutions. The scandal, frequently described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, has now been dramatised in a series currently airing on ITV.

Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Nissan were among the companies to ask for delays in enforcement of the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate that obliges them to sell increasing proportions of electric cars or face heavy fines, according to documents seen by the Guardian. However, Volkswagen, Ford and Tesla argued that the ZEV mandate should be tougher.

Ministers had promised that by the end of this parliament, they would spend £2.4bn a year on agriculture. This money was to replace the EU’s common agricultural policy, which paid farmers for each hectare of land they managed. Instead, the government promised that farmers could improve the natural environment and be paid handsomely for delivering public goods, thus helping nature and keeping farms in business.

Paul Dales, chief UK economist, said:  We still think that interest rates will be reduced from 5.25% now to 3.00% in 2025. That’s a little lower than the trough of 3.25% currently priced into the financial markets.      2.35pm GMT   Wall Street has opened lower as investors took some profits, and ahead of the Federal Reserve’s minutes of its last meeting. The Dow Jones lost 85 points, or 0.2%, to 37,629 while the S&P 500 opened nearly 18 points lower at 4,725, a 0.37% drop, and the Nasdaq fell 125 points, or 0.8%, to 14,641.     2.29pm GMT  AstraZeneca payment sends C4XD's shares soaring  A biotech company led by a former chair of the UK government’s Covid vaccines taskforce has received a drug development milestone payment from AstraZeneca, sending its shares soaring. C4X Discovery, a drug discovery company listed on London’s junior AIM market, received a milestone payment of $11m. Its shares jumped more than 50% on the news, and is now trading about 45% higher at 12.63p. AstraZeneca, the UK’s biggest drugmaker, is using C4XD’s programme to deliver an oral therapy for the treatment of inflammatory and respiratory diseases, with a focus on chronic respiratory disease. Under their partnership, C4XD could receive up to $400m from AstraZeneca over time. C4XD was founded in Manchester in 2007 by two scientists and created its own virtual reality platform for drug discovery. Its interim executive chairman and chief executive is Clive Dix, who was interim chair of the vaccines taskforce during the pandemic and has also chaired the BioIndustry Association. A life sciences veteran, he began his career in industry at Switzerland’s Ciba-Geigy (now part of Novartis) and GlaxoWellcome, and was co-founder of two companies that were later snapped up by Biogen and Pfizer. Dix said:  This significant preclinical milestone payment marks the progress AstraZeneca has made in driving the NRF2 Activator programme forward. NRF2 is a challenging target and this achievement provides further validation of our ability to generate differentiated, quality molecules in immuno-inflammation. We believe that our unique approach can deliver transformative oral therapies for patients suffering from immuno-inflammatory diseases. This is a great start to our year and we are confident of seeing further progress across our entire portfolio in 2024.  The biotech company’s largest shareholder is Richard Griffiths, a serial private investor, with a 22% holding.  Other top shareholders are financial institutions Polar Capital and Bombard Odier Asset management with over 17% each, followed by Baillie Gifford and Canaccord.  Updated at 2.55pm GMT    1.53pm GMT  FTSE 100 boardrooms show more stability than football club dressing rooms  Sixty league clubs changed their manager in 2023 compared to 19 changes in chief executive (and 31 in chief financial officer) at FTSE 100 firms, according to research by the stockbroker AJ Bell.  The average tenure of a FTSE 100 chief executive is 5.4 years (and that of CFOs is 4.1 years) compared to just 1.5 years for all football league managers (and 2.3 years for the Premier League alone). Two football managers – Wayne Rooney at Birmingham City and Matt Etherington at Colchester United – have already lost their jobs this year, while seven FTSE 100 firms have announced a change of CEO and 13 a change in CFO for 2024. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:  In 2023 it looks like shareholders and boardrooms showed more patience than football club executives and supporters, even if headline stock market indices struggled to perform and boardroom turnover was unusually high. Nineteen FTSE 100 firms saw a change in chief executive, well above the post-2000 average of 13, while a new manager pitched up at no fewer than 60 of the 92 Premiership and Football League clubs in 2023, with seven of those 60 getting in a new man (and they were all men) on two occasions and two making three changes. Again, the FTSE 100 showed more stability here, as three interim bosses stepped aside – Mark FitzPatrick at Prudential, David Egan at RS Group and Nicandro Durante at Reckitt Benckiser – and only one more was appointed, when Murray Auchinloss had to fill the gap caused by Bernard Looney’s fall from grace at BP. Three months on and BP is yet to decide whether Mr Auchinloss will get the top job on a permanent basis or whether another candidate will prevail.  The total of 19 changes in CEO among FTSE 100 firms was, however, unusually high. The average since 2000 is 13 and only 2020’s total of 22 is higher since the turn of the century, Mould noted.  This comes after two relatively quiet years in 2021 and 2022, although they followed a year of huge boardroom turnover in 2020, which saw 22 changes in CEO, the highest figure this century. Another seven changes have already been announced for 2024 and one (DS Smith) for 2025. Of those, only DS Smith has yet to select its new leader, as the search for Miles Roberts’ successor continues and the packaging giant has time on its side.   The succession within the FTSE 100 planning feels more orderly than it is at Championship team Birmingham City and League Two’s Colchester United, who have sacked Wayne Rooney and Matt Etherington as their managers in the first few days of the New Year.  Nonetheless, Mould said  2023 was perhaps a more challenging year than 2022. Even if the long-awaited recession failed to materialise, the UK economy could not gather much positive momentum and the FTSE 100 hardly set the world alight either, as it lagged the majority of its major stock market index peers, with the notable exception of China’s Shanghai Composite index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. Sticky inflation, rising interest rates, Quantitative Tightening and geopolitical uncertainty all mean that building any real head of steam post Covid-19 and lockdowns was perhaps not as easy as many had hoped.      1.05pm GMT  HSBC joins mortgage rate-cutting war with deals below 4%  HSBC has become the latest big UK lender to announce across-the-board mortgage interest rate cuts, with leading names announcing reductions of up to one percentage point. The bank’s new deals announced on Wednesday include a headline-grabbing five-year fixed remortgage deal of 3.94% for those borrowing up to 60% of the property value. From tomorrow, HSBC’s two-year fixed rate for remortgages will dip below 4.50% for the first time since early June last year, with the headline rate hitting 4.49%, again for those with at least 40% equity in their home. For those looking to fix longer term, HSBC is now offering a 10-year fixed rate deal starting from at 3.99%, suggesting that the bank is convinced rates are only going lower.   Related: HSBC joins mortgage rate-cutting war with deals below 4%       1.02pm GMT  German unemployment edges higher  Unemployment has risen slightly in Germany but much less than expected, and last year’s jobless rate was one of the lowest since German reunification. The Federal Employment Agency said the number of people out of work increased by 5,000 to 2.7 million between October and November. Analysts had expected a 20,000 increase. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.9%. Andrea Nahles, the agency’s chair, said:  If we look back at 2023, we can see that the weak economy has left its mark on the labor market — however, considering the extent of the stress and uncertainty, the labor market is still holding up well.  Germany’s unemployment rate has risen from 5% in March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. The agency has previously said that the arrival of more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees added 0.4 percentage points to its jobless rate. At the same time, many German companies and sectors still report labour shortages.     11.33am GMT  Stocks fall on second trading day of 2024  Last year was a blast for many stock markets, but today, on the second trading day of 2024, UK and European shares are drifting lower again, following in the footsteps of Asian markets and Wall Street yesterday. The FTSE 100 rose in early trading but is now down 56 points, or 0.7%, at 7,665 – on the index’s 40th birthday. Germany’s Dax has lost 0.6% while France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MIB are around 1% lower. Stock futures are pointing to fresh losses on Wall Street when it opens later, while yields (or interest rates) on US government bonds extended gains ahead of the the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s last meeting. They should give us some pointers as to the Fed’s thinking on the economy and rate cuts. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said:  European markets are following the bearish precedent set by US equities yesterday, with Apple having led a wider big tech sell-off. While we have seen the S&P 500 enjoy a 14% gain in the last two months of 2023 alone, that extended move points towards a strong possibility that we could see some profit taking come into play before long. Questions remain over the likeliness of the 150-basis points worth of rate cuts expected by the markets currently, and thus there is a risk that the Federal Reserve members will seek to reign in those expectations somewhat. Today’s FOMC minutes will provide one such opportunity for the disparity between market rate expectations and the Fed outlook to narrow, with traders keeping a close eye on the language behind a meeting that was widely considered to be highly dovish. With many Fed members emerging to reign in expectations following that meeting, there is a good chance that we see a somewhat less expansive view than that expressed by Jay Powell. After all, the dot plot expectations signal a likely three rate cuts this year, bringing risk for equities given the current market pricing for six.  Turning to the Kantar data, he said:  Today has seen good news on the inflation front in the UK, with the annual rate of grocery price inflation falling sharply from 9.1% to 6.7%. With the Russia-Ukraine conflict having sparked a sharp surge in European food prices, we are finally seeing those pressures abate. This further helps the Bank of England’s cause, with the latest CPI figure of 3.9% bringing increased hope that we will soon see inflation return back to target this year.

Analysts at Engie EnergyScan said:  Forecasts for lower temperatures and lower renewable generation and technical buying are lending some support this morning. But, given comfortable stock levels and strong supply, the price upside potential appears limited.  The British day-ahead contract rose 5.5p, or 7.7%, to 77p per therm while the February contract was up 2.73p, or 3.6%, at 79p per therm. The benchmark month-ahead Dutch contract rose 5.1% to €31.70 per megawatt hour, while the March contract hit €31.45, up 3.9%.

Europe’s largest airline said that in early December “most” of the larger online travel agent sites – including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak – “suddenly removed Ryanair’s flights from sale on their websites”. The airline said that while these travel sites only accounted for a “small fraction” of Ryanair’s bookings, the sudden removal had affected its load factor by “1% to 2%” in December and January, and would “soften short-term yields”. Load factor is the percentage of available seats that an airline is able to sell on each flight. Ryanair said that it had responded by releasing more lower-priced fares to consumers directly through its own website.   Related: Ryanair ticket sales hit after travel agent websites delist airline       9.41am GMT   Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, has looked at the slowdown in UK grocery inflation. According to Kantar, it slowed to an annual rate of 6.7% in December, the lowest since April 2022, from 9.1% in November, in the fastest month-on-month decline on record.  While inflation is coming down, prices are still rising on average albeit at a slower pace, meaning that customers are still having to spend more to obtain a similar number of items. The cost-of-living crisis has prompted shoppers to trade down to cheaper, unbranded products, a shift which has boosted sales of supermarkets’ own-label lines such as Sainsburys’ Taste the Difference. Price sensitivity among consumers has improved the fortunes of the German discounters Aldi and Lidl which enjoyed stellar Christmas sales, allowing them to increase their combined market share to 17%. The two supermarkets have intensified price competition in the UK, prompting other supermarkets to offer discounts and promotions and think of innovative ways to drive customer demand such as a renewed focus on their loyalty schemes. While Marks & Spencer is not included in the Kantar figures, it was a standout stock market winner for 2023, with shares hitting a five-year high, valuing the company at over £70m.   Updated at 9.42am GMT    9.39am GMT   Back in the UK, there is more good news for consumers, as Superdrug has announced that it is reducing its prices on more than 150 everyday items, from baby and healthcare products to cosmetics, as of today. Prices have been cut by as much as 50% on own-brand items. The retailer said is had previously frozen the prices of more than 5,000 items across its stores and online for limited periods in recent years. Jamie Archer, own-brand director at Superdrug, said:  We know that recent years have seen prices rocket due to the rising cost of living, so are happy to be able to reduce prices to help shoppers.      9.06am GMT  Turkey's inflation rate rises to nearly 65%  In Turkey, it’s a different picture. Annual inflation climbed to 64.77% in December, from 62% in November, according to official figures. The upward trend is expected to continue in coming months after a big rise in the minimum wage. Inflation ended the second year in a row at almost 65% for the first time since the late 1990s. The reading is in line with forecasts from the central bank and the government. The government’s decision to raise the official minimum wage by nearly 50% is likely to push inflation even higher in the coming months. It could go beyond 70% by May. This will mean more interest rate hikes, following seven rises since June. The central bank expects inflation to slow in the second half of this year, to 36% by the end of the year — still more than seven times the official target. Governor Hafize Gaye Erkan will present fresh forecasts in February. Policymakers have warned that domestic demand, along with “stickiness in services inflation,” are among the main factors pushing up prices. In December, restaurant and hotel prices jumped 93% year-on-year, while overall services inflation nearly hit 91%.  Updated at 9.06am GMT    8.25am GMT  UK grocery price inflation slows to 6.7%, data shows  Grocery price inflation in the UK slowed to an annual rate of 6.7% in December, while retailers enjoyed their busiest Christmas since 2019, according to the data firm Kantar. Inflation is now at its lowest level since April 2022, but many consumers are still feeling the pinch. Prices for sweets, eggs and frozen potato products rose fastest but prices fell for dairy items, including butter, milk and cream. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said:  The rate of inflation is coming down at the fastest pace we have ever recorded, but consumers are still facing pretty hefty pressures on their budgets. Retailers were clearly working hard during the festive period to offer best value and win over shoppers, and promotions were central to their strategy. Nearly one third of all spend in the four weeks to Christmas Eve was made on items with some kind of offer, the highest level since December 2020 and £823 million more than last year.”  Britons made 488m trips to the supermarkets over the four weeks to 24 December, 12m more than a year earlier, and the largest number at Christmas since pre-pandemic times. A record £13.7bn passed through the tills last month, with the average household spending an all-time high of £477. The discount chains Aldi and Lidl hit their highest ever market shares for the festive period while Britain’s two biggest supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury’s, were also among Christmas winners. Lidl’s sales grew 13.8% year-on-year in the 12 weeks to 24 December and Aldis were up 9.9% taking their combined market share to 17%. Sainsbury’s sales rose 9.3% while Tesco’s sales were up 7.5%. Shoppers spent £13.7bn on groceries in the run-up to Christmas – 7% more than a year before – as they sought out bargains and switched to discounters to try to offset price inflation. Fraser McKevitt explained:  As we expected, this Christmas was a whopper. Friday 22 December turned out to be the most popular shopping day, when just over 25m trips were made and consumers spent £803m in physical stores – that’s 85% more than the average Friday in 2023. Online’s share of the market held steady at 11.6%, as nearly one in five households got a delivery in for the big day.

UK retail bosses have warned that the Houthi rebel attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea are delaying shipments, which will affect product availability and could push up prices in the UK. Maersk and other large shipping firms have diverted vessels away; they are now taking a much longer rote around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and up the west side of Africa. The British Retail Consortium warned this could have knock-on effects on product availability and prices. Chief executive Helen Dickinson said this was “as a result of higher transportation and shipping insurance costs”. She added:  Over the coming months, some goods will take longer to be shipped.  Leeds-based Boxer Gifts designs games and seasonal presents, which are made in China and then shipped to Europe via the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. Thomas O’Brien, boss of the family-run business, told the BBC that some of its costs had gone up by 250% over the last fortnight.  We just about got used to shipments arriving on time after Covid, but at the moment with the Red Sea, that’s adding another 10 to 14 days to shipments. You end up with a two or three week delay. We’ve got Valentine’s Day products that are likely to be delayed and miss Valentine’s Day. The same effect is going to be felt on Mother’s Day meaning a huge chunk of our selling time for these games is missed.  Oil prices are steady this morning, with Brent crude trading at $75.88 a barrel while US light crude is at $70.3 a barrel. Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Maersk have halted sailings through the Red Sea until further notice, while France’s CMA-CGM is increasing shipments between Europe and the Mediterranean. On a more positive note, the FTSE 100 turns 40 today. It started the year with a 0.15% drop yesterday. Our financial editor Nils Pratley has looked at its ups and downs over the last four decades.   Related: Footsie turns 40: FTSE 100’s rise, rise and stagnation over four decades   On the first trading day of the new year, many stock markets fell back yesterday after notching up gains in recent weeks. Traders have reassessed the outlook for interest rate cuts: markets had been pricing in as much as 160 basis points of cuts in the US for 2024, twice as much as the Federal Reserve projects, but are now pricing in less than 150bps. Expectations of a Fed rate cut by March have fallen back to an 85% probability and similarly at the European Central Bank the chance of a cut by March is now seen at 59%, down from 71% last Thursday, as analysts at Deutsche Bank noted. The minutes of the Fed’s last meeting, out later today, should shed more light on the central bank’s thinking. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed down 0.6% yesterday, while the Nasdaq saw a larger, 1.6% decline. Stocks in Asia declined overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei slipping 0.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.9%, the Australian market dropped 1.4% and the South Korean market shed 2.3%. In 2023, global financial markets confounded gloomy expectations when stocks rallied and bonds reversed heavy losses made early in the year. Many major share indices posted double-digit gains as falling inflation raised hopes of interest rate cuts next year, while recession fears faded at least for the US. Britain’s FTSE 100 lagged though, and gained less than 4% last year.

        "content": "Several of the world’s biggest carmakers lobbied the UK government to try to weaken or delay rules to accelerate electric car sales and cut Britain’s carbon emissions. Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Nissan were among the companies to ask for delays in enforcement of the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate that obliges them to sell increasing proportions of electric cars or face heavy fines, according to documents seen by the Guardian. However, Volkswagen, Ford and Tesla argued that the ZEV mandate should be tougher. The lobbying was contained in responses to a government consultation shared with the Guardian by Tom Riley, the author of the Fast Charge, an industry newsletter. In September, Rishi Sunak pushed back a ban from 2030 on all sales of petrol and diesel cars to 2035. However, despite delaying the flagship green policy, the government stuck with the related ZEV mandate plans to force carmakers to sell more and more electric cars each year. Under the ZEV mandate, 22% of new cars sold in 2024 must be zero-emission, a figure that rises steadily to 80% by 2030. Carmakers’ responses to the new rules were heavily redacted, with pages of text blacked out at the carmakers’ request. Nevertheless, they reveal the arguments the companies made against one of the UK’s key policies to reduce its carbon emissions and reflect the uneven progress in the race between manufacturers to shift to electric cars – and the panic in some parts of the car industry that they could lose out because they are not shifting quickly enough. The carmakers who backed delaying the full ZEV mandate argued that the rules came too late for them to change production plans to increase electric vehicle sales. Japan’s Toyota, the world’s top car seller in 2022 but a laggard in the electric car race, said it was “extremely concerned” by the UK targets up to 2027, which would be “challenging for manufacturers like Toyota” and could cause financial and brand damage. Toyota has bet heavily on hybrid cars that combine a petrol engine with a battery, and has argued for a delay to fossil fuel bans to protect its Derbyshire hybrid car factory. JLR has the most UK car factories, producing Jaguar and Land Rover cars, but is only now launching its second electric car, a Range Rover, five years after its first, the I-Pace. The manufacturer said it was “far from certain” that carmakers could hit the targets, and that “targets in the early years are set at unachievable levels”. The Vauxhall maker Stellantis and Japan’s Nissan also backed delays in different forms. After the lobbying the government included “flexibility” in the final rules, including provisions to allow carmakers to miss targets in one year if they sold more in other years. There was also a provision for manufacturers of fewer than 2,500 cars a year that exempts them from the rules until 2030. The British sports car makers Aston Martin Lagonda and McLaren both argued that they would be unable to meet the targets. Aston Martin said legal action against supposedly unfair regulations could follow. Other manufacturers strongly backed the rules. The US carmakers Ford and Tesla argued that the government should force carmakers to sell even more electric cars. Elon Musk’s Tesla, which pioneered electric car sales and has just been overtaken by China’s BYD as the biggest seller of EVs, said the rules were “not sufficient to drive more than organic market evolution” and said “it is possible that targets that look a stretch today will quickly be surpassed”. Ford said it “believes that the suggested trajectory can be met by many manufacturers across the UK market, and will ensure that those that are lagging accelerate their development appropriately, with the option of trading certificates to make up any shortfalls”. Germany’s Volkswagen, the world’s second-largest carmaker, said the targets were “ambitious but seem to be generally feasible”. Riley, who obtained the documents under freedom of information laws, said: “Clearly a lot of carmakers, whilst being enthusiastic about the EV transition in public, had reservations about these trajectories in private. It will be interesting to see how this manifests with the ZEV mandate kicking in from January.” The carmakers were approached for comment. Toyota shared a previous statement welcoming the ZEV mandate and its inclusion of flexibilities, while a Stellantis spokesperson said the company had argued for enforcement of the mandate to kick in in 2025. An Aston Martin spokesperson said the company had a “clear plan to have an electrified line-up of sports cars and SUVs” but shared specific challenges for smaller manufacturers. He added: “Aston Martin will be fully compliant with the regulations published by the government and will seek to achieve the targets set out.”"

        "content": "Addressing competition issues and increasing unemployment benefits and pensions are ways the Albanese government could tackle cost-of-living pressures but they would have to be coupled with savings to avoid reigniting inflation, economists say. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Wednesday said he had asked Treasury and the finance department to develop “further propositions” for providing cost-of-living relief by the May budget. “[What] are the measures that can take pressure off families on cost-of-living without putting pressure on inflation. That’s the key issue here,” Albanese said in Sydney at his first press conference for 2024. “If you were just to distribute additional cash to people, you potentially make inflation worse and therefore don’t help to solve the problem.”   Related: Golden zone: could Australia’s economy pull off a miracle in 2024?   Australia’s consumer price inflation rate peaked in December 2022 at 8.4% and has generally trended down ever since, reaching 4.9% last October. Households and businesses have been squeezed by 13 interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank during the current tightening cycle that began in May 2022. Pressure for more relief is likely to mount as the government’s own finances remain robust in the short term at least, with the strong chance of a second consecutive budget surplus this fiscal year. Cost-of-living support is already about $23bn. The challenge for the government, though, is there are few measures it can take that will have immediate effect and the ones it implemented in 2023 may have diminished effects if extended this year, the analysts said. “The first thing for people to remember is it’s hard,” Chris Richardson, an independent economist, said. If governments in Australia or elsewhere “could take care of the cost-of-living crisis, then everybody would be using that magic wand”. The approach taken last year often involved “rejigging money”, so households ended up better off at the expense of companies, Richardson said. Examples included setting a price cap on gas that trimmed some of the windfall profits of energy companies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rather than any actions drillers themselves took. Doubling typical pharmacy prescriptions to 60 days was another. “The money comes out of profits and goes into punters’ pockets,” he said. “There’s a case for that where profits aren’t reasonable, where something has stopped competition working.” Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, called on the government to develop a “serious cost-of-living package” that was “squarely targeted to give help to people who need it the most”. Goldie noted the near doubling of support during the Covid pandemic lifted 646,000 people, including 245,000 children, out of poverty. The government’s own Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee found lifting daily jobseeker and related payments to 90% of the age pension from the current $54 to $70 would merely return them to 1999 levels. “The government must also target energy relief to people who are the most disadvantaged, including by investing in energy efficiency upgrades and solar installations in social housing and low-income rental housing and mandating energy efficiency standards in private rentals,” Goldie said. Independent economist Saul Eslake said the government deserved “a great deal of credit” for not spending additional revenues that had landed via higher commodity prices, inflation or other sources, unlike some previous Coalition governments. “That ought to be the template,” he said. “They should avoid the temptation to just throw cash at households.” Richardson said any increase in benefits, such as rental assistance, could be offset by further cuts or delays in “bad infrastructure projects”. In November, the government said it was cutting 50 such projects. According to the RBA, government electricity rebates, increased childcare subsidies and other changes in government policies “subtracted around half a percentage point from headline inflation [of 5.4%] in the September quarter”.   Related: Australia’s property market faces fresh peaks and troughs with slowing prices and interest rates tipped to drop   One challenge is that policies that helped households last year may not have the same effect as last year, Eslake said. Childcare support, for instance, was already covering much of the cost of that service. Other possible actions could include tweaking or delaying the controversial stage-three tax cuts that will pump about $21bn into the economy next fiscal year. Reducing the GST temporarily from 10% to 9% would help reduce prices immediately but would require compensating the states to the tune of $8.8bn a year, Richardson said. Some price pressure relief, though, may already be on the way, easing the need for government action that anyway wouldn’t take effect until after the May budget. Wholesale power prices, for instance, were down 70% in the September quarter from a year earlier and should at least result in smaller increases in 2024. Global oil prices have also dropped in recent months, bringing the prospect of cheaper motor fuel. “We do see inflation continuing to moderate – it’s just a question of how quickly,” said Taylor Nugent, a senior Nab economist. Nab is among the minority of banks to predict the RBA has one more rate rise to come, most likely in February. Nugent said while government subsidies might reduce “measured inflation” by lowering the cost of item picked up by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the actions only mask the “aggregate” inflation in the economy. The support “means that people have more money to spend on other things, and so, on a forward-looking basis, it puts upward pressure on inflation, more generally”, he said. “That slows that rebalancing of supply and demand that the RBA is looking for in order to get inflation back on a more stable basis.”"

        "content": "Ryanair has said that it has seen a drop in the number of tickets it has been able to sell after a number of major online booking websites stripped the budget carrier’s flights from their listings. Europe’s largest airline said that in early December “most” of the larger online travel agent sites – including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak – “suddenly removed Ryanair’s flights from sale on their websites”. The airline said that while these travel sites only accounted for a “small fraction” of Ryanair’s bookings, the sudden removal had affected its load factor by “1% to 2%” in December and January, and would “soften short-term yields”. Load factor is the percentage of available seats that an airline is able to sell on each flight. Ryanair said that it had responded by releasing more lower-priced fares to consumers directly through its own website. In December, the airline announced a 10% discount sale on more than 400,000 fares for travel between January and the end of March. Ryanair said the removal of its flights from the travel websites would not materially affect its full-year financial forecasts for passenger numbers or profits. The company claimed it welcomed the move by the websites, alleging that many of them overcharge customers with extra fees. “Ryanair will respond to this welcome removal of our flights from OTA [online travel agent] websites by lowering fares where necessary to encourage all passengers to book directly on Ryanair.com where they are guaranteed to always get the lowest fares without OTA overcharges, fake contact info, or other pricing/refund scams.” Ryanair said it was not clear what the reason was behind its removal from the sites but said it may be down to a recent Irish high court ruling, which it said granted Ryanair a permanent injunction against the screenscraper Flightbox from “unlawfully scraping Ryanair.com content” for online travel agents. The company said its flights were still available on some sites, such as Google Flights, which it said “do not add any hidden mark-ups” and direct consumers to complete their bookings on its own website. On Wednesday, the airline released its latest update showing that passenger numbers rose 9% year on year in December but its load factor fell by one percentage point. More than 900 Ryanair flights were cancelled last month because of the Israel-Gaza war and the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan. The update comes amid a long-running dispute between Ryanair and online booking sites, with the airline having launched legal action in the US against the Booking.com owner, Booking Holdings, and its subsidiaries, including Kayak, Agoda and Priceline. Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak were contacted for comment."

        "content": "UK shoppers spent £13.7bn on groceries in the run-up to Christmas – 7% more than a year before – as they sought out bargains and switched to discounters to try to offset price inflation. The number of items bought rose by 2% in December as prices climbed by 6.7%, according to analysts at Kantar, although that was down from 9.6% in November – making it the biggest monthly drop in inflation the data firm has ever recorded. Prices for sweets, eggs and frozen potato products rose fastest but prices fell for dairy items, including butter, milk and cream. With household budgets tight and heavy competition for business among the major chains for the big festive shop, almost a third of all spending in the four weeks went on discounted items, the highest level since December 2020. Britons made 488m visits to supermarkets in the month, making it the busiest festive period since 2019 as households made multiple trips in search of bargains – a way of shopping they had moved away from during the coronavirus pandemic.  Interactive  Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “As we expected, this Christmas was a whopper. Friday 22 December turned out to be the most popular shopping day, when just over 25m trips were made and consumers spent £803m in physical stores. That’s 85% more than the average Friday in 2023. “The rate of inflation is coming down at the fastest pace we have ever recorded, but consumers are still facing pretty hefty pressures on their budgets. Retailers were clearly working hard during the festive period to offer best value and win over shoppers.” The appetite for Christmas dinner was particularly strong as heavy discounts, including on bags of traditional vegetables for as little as 15p, drove volumes of parsnips, sprouts and potatoes up 12%, 9% and 8%. Festive meats including pigs in blankets, sausages, hams and turkeys were also up by 6% collectively. McKevitt said: “We’re creatures of habit when it comes to Christmas, and our data shows that the classic festive plate remains much the same. However, mince pies and Christmas puddings did buck the trend. They were less popular this year, with volumes falling by 4% and 7% respectively.” However, McKevitt said Britons did not appear to have lost their sweet tooth as a 5% rise in cream sales suggested “dessert was still very much on the menu”, just in a less traditional form. Kantar said Aldi and Lidl were the fastest-growing grocery chains, with sales up 13.8% and 9.9% in the three months to 25 December. However, Tesco and Sainsbury’s, the UK’s two largest supermarkets, also took a share, with Sainsbury’s grabbing more than Aldi to claim a 15.8% slice of the market, its highest level since 2020 as sales rose 9.3%, making it the best performer among the traditional chains. Tesco’s share rose 0.1 percentage points to 27.6% as its sales rose by 7.6%. Asda lost the biggest slice of market share – 0.4 percentage points – as its sales rose 3.4%. Morrisons had the lowest sales growth of the major chains, with sales up only 3.2%, well behind inflation, so that its slice of the market shrank by 0.3 percentage points to 8.8%. Shoppers made 488m more trips to stores – 2.5% more than last year – but online’s share of the grocery market remained steady at 11.6%, as almost one in five households got a delivery in time for 25 December, another trend that helped the big supermarkets fight off competition from the discounters, which do not sell groceries online."

        "content": "The amount of electricity generated by the UK’s gas and coal power plants fell by 20% last year, with consumption of fossil fuels at its lowest level since 1957. Not since Harold Macmillan was the UK prime minister and the Beatles’ John Lennon and Paul McCartney met for the first time has the UK used less coal and gas. The UK’s gas power plants last year generated 31% of the UK’s electricity, or 98 terawatt hours (TWh), according to a report by the industry journal Carbon Brief, while the UK’s last remaining coal plant produced enough electricity to meet just 1% of the UK’s power demand or 4TWh. Fossil fuels were squeezed out of the electricity system by a surge in renewable energy generation combined with higher electricity imports from France and Norway and a long-term trend of falling demand. Higher power imports last year were driven by an increase in nuclear power from France and hydropower from Norway in 2023. This marked a reversal from 2022 when a string of nuclear outages in France helped make the UK a net exporter of electricity for the first time. Carbon Brief found that gas and coal power plants made up just over a third of the UK’s electricity supplies in 2023, while renewable energy provided the single largest source of power to the grid at a record 42%. It was the third year this decade that renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, hydro and biomass power, outperformed fossil fuels, according to the analysis. Renewables and Britain’s nuclear reactors, which generated 13% of electricity supplies last year, helped low-carbon electricity make up 55% of the UK’s electricity in 2023.  Interactive  Dan McGrail, the chief executive of RenewableUK, said the data shows “the central role that wind, solar and other clean power sources are consistently playing in Britain’s energy transition”. “We’re working closely with the government to accelerate the pace at which we build new projects and new supply chains in the face of intense global competition, as everyone is trying to replicate our success,” McGrail said. Electricity from fossil fuels was two-thirds lower in 2023 compared with its peak in 2008, according to Carbon Brief. It found that coal has dropped by 97% and gas by 43% in the last 15 years. Coal power is expected to fall further in 2024 after the planned shutdown of Britain’s last remaining coal plant in September. The Ratcliffe on Soar coal plant, owned by the German utility Uniper, is scheduled to shut before next winter after generating power for over 55 years. Renewable energy has increased sixfold since 2008 as the UK has constructed more wind and solar farms, and the large Drax coal plant has converted some of its generating units to burn biomass pellets. Electricity demand has tumbled by 22% since its peak in 2005, according to the data, as part of a long-term trend driven by more energy efficient homes and appliances as well as a decline in the UK’s manufacturing sector. Demand for electricity is expected to double as the UK aims to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 because the plan relies heavily on replacing fossil fuel transport and heating with electric alternatives. In recent weeks, offshore wind developers have given the green light to another four large windfarms in UK waters, including the world’s largest offshore windfarm at Hornsea 3, which will be built off the North Yorkshire coast by Denmark’s Ørsted. The German utility RWE has also agreed to buy the Norfolk Boreas, Norfolk Vanguard East and Norfolk Vanguard West from Sweden’s Vattenfall in a €1bn deal that is expected to revive plans for the projects, which were derailed last year by rising supply chain costs. • This article was amended on 3 January 2024 because an earlier version mistakenly said the Ratcliffe on Soar coal plant had been generating power for 24 years; in fact it has been operating since 1968."

        "content": "One of the biggest investors in Thames Water has slashed the value of its stake in the debt-laden utility by almost two-thirds, weeks after the company admitted that it does not have enough money to make its debt repayments. A fund controlled by Thames Water’s second largest investor, the University Superannuation Scheme (USS), reported a loss of almost £600m last year after writing down the value of the embattled water company as it struggles to shore up its balance sheet. The USS, the largest private pension fund in the UK, holds a 20% stake in Thames Water’s ultimate parent company, Kemble Water, mostly through its subsidiary Church Water Investment. The investment vehicle said the value of its stake in Kemble had fallen to £364m last year from £956m in 2022. This could imply that the value of Britain’s biggest water company has plummeted from almost £5bn in 2022 to £1.9bn last year. The second major write-down of Thames Water’s valuation in recent months follows cuts made by the company’s largest shareholder, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (Omers), in July last year. One of Canada’s biggest public sector pension funds revealed a one-third write-down after reporting that its 30% stake in Kemble had fallen from a valuation of £979m at the end of 2021 to about £700m in 2022. A spokesperson for USS said the fund continued to back Thames’s turnaround plans and would provide “patient capital” to support the “long-term needs” of the company. Thames’s mounting financial woes have cast doubt over the future of the company as it struggles to raise the funds needed to tackle a debt pile of around £18bn and increase investment to tackle sewage overflows and water leaks. The company, which serves about 25% of households living in England, admitted to MPs late last year that it does not currently have enough cash to cover its debt repayments. It faces repayment deadlines for £1.4bn debt in the coming years, including £190m in April. Fears for the future of Thames reached fever pitch last summer after its former chief executive Sarah Bentley resigned and it emerged the government was drawing up rescue plans in case an emergency re-nationalisation was required. The company last month appointed Chris Weston, a former British Gas executive, as its new boss with a pay package of up to £2.3m a year. USS said: “The challenges facing Thames Water are the manifestation of historic under-investment over multiple decades and, more recently, the significant financial impact of soaring energy prices and other inflationary cost pressures. However, we have given our backing to Thames Water’s latest business plan. “As a long-term investor, we can provide patient capital and be an active, responsible steward of the company. While the value we place on our Thames investment may go up or down as part of our regular revaluations, we continue to view this as a long-term investment, in line with the long-term needs of the scheme.  “That is why we were willing to commit additional funds to the business in March [in 2023] and have shown willingness to commit more in the future.” Thames failed to reach its goal of securing £1bn in emergency funds last July, after its shareholders agreed to make £750m available to shore up the company’s balance sheet until 2025. It has emerged that around £500m of this package is a loan which will require interest payments of 8%. The USS spokesperson added: “We have not received a shareholder dividend or payments of interest on any shareholder loans since we first invested in 2017, with shareholders instead re-investing capital back into the business to drive improvements.  “We remain of the view that, with an appropriate regulatory environment, the long-term objective of repairing important UK infrastructure and paying pensions to our members are in strong alignment.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-02T18:32:53+00:00",
        "content": "The new year game of awarding knighthoods and damehoods, as it relates to high-profile business people, has long felt like a nonsense. As the examples of the de-gonged Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland and James Crosby at HBOS (who gave up his knighthood voluntarily) should have taught us, at least wait until these people’s careers are over before trying to judge their contributions. In any case, the boardroom brigade doesn’t need extra baubles. No harm would occur if they were excluded from the show. But, within this imperfect system, let’s acknowledge that Sir Tim Martin, the founder and chair of JD Wetherspoon, is a deserving candidate for a gong via standard criteria. He was a controversial pick in the new year crop, presumably because so many people loathe his Brexit sermons and in-your-face “no deal” beermats, but, if we’re talking about services to the hospitality industry, Martin has put in a shift that is hard to match. Back in 1979, when he founded the company, the beer trade was in such a uncompetitive and customer-unfriendly state that the Beer Orders were needed a decade later to break up the dominance and tied estates of the big six national brewers. JD Wetherspoon prospered in the liberalised environment because it concentrated on selling a decent pint at a low price, and ensuring real ales (an imperilled category back in the day) were available. Unlike other pub-only operators that emerged in that era, Martin refrained from balance sheet financial engineering, which is to his credit and another reason why the chain has proved a long-term winner. It can afford to invest for the long-term and Martin, still touring the country three days a week to inspect the premises, is on top of tiny details. The unfussy pubs obviously aren’t to everybody’s taste, but they operate a basic “open to all” philosophy: you’ll struggle to find similar establishments where college students and retirees coexist. The pro-Spoons view that the pubs provide a modern form of social hub is an exaggeration, but it’s directionally correct. The task of reinventing high streets would certainly be harder if the 800-strong chain had not re-purposed so many premises vacated by banks, building societies and cinemas. On pay for staff – which seems to be the non-Brexit objection in some quarters to Martin’s knighthood – JD Wetherspoon can hardly be blamed for low salaries in an entire industry. For the record, the company says starting pay is above the national minimum wage and that 10,600 staff have been there for more than five years, which suggests a certain level of loyalty in a sector with high levels of turnover. An employee share ownership scheme has distributed 26m shares since 2006, which will amount to tiny sums in many cases but also equates to 20% of shares in circulation today, which one suspects is a far higher ratio than most companies with similar schemes. The company also pays a lot of tax when there isn’t a pandemic. There is an effort by the usual suspects to cloak Martin’s gong with an “up yours” message to “remoaners”. Don’t rise to the bait. In business terms, Martin has built an operation that is popular with its customers and genuinely different from its competitors. That’s roughly what the flawed system is supposed to recognise."

BYD, which has been backed by the US investment billionaire Warren Buffett since 2008, is on track to beat Tesla’s production for a second consecutive year. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, said that it produced 3.02m new energy vehicles in 2023, ahead of Tesla which announced Tuesday that it made 1.84m cars. However, BYD’s sales figures include 1.6m battery-only cars, and 1.4m hybrids, which means Tesla is still the leader in the production of electric battery-only cars. Nevertheless, in the final quarter of last year BYD outsold Tesla in battery-only car sales - 526,000 to 484,000 - for the first time. Most of BYD’s vehicles sell at a lower price point than Tesla, which derives about 20% of its sales from the Chinese market. Chinese electric car makers such as BYD and Nio have set their sights on becoming major players in international markets, with a particular focus on Europe. In December, BYD, which currently sells five models in Europe and has plans to launch three more this year, announced plans to build a new production plant in Hungary. Last year, the company said it did not consider building its first European car factory in the UK because of the impact of Brexit. China’s top-selling electric car maker is targeting sales of about 800,000 cars annually in Europe by 2030. BYD said that the UK had not even made a top 10 list of possible locations to build its first European car plant. The Hong Kong-listed BYD, which was founded by former university professor Wang Chuanfu and began developing batteries in 1995, intends to become a global powerhouse in the electric vehicle market.  Updated at 3.04pm GMT    2.25pm GMT  BT misses deadline to remove Huawei kit from mobile network over security concerns  BT has missed the deadline to remove Huawei equipment from its mobile network, following a UK government order that the Chinese company’s technology posed a security risk. In 2020, the government ordered UK telecoms operators to replace Huawei technology used in core 5G mobile and broadband networks, where personal data is processed, as part of a wider ban over national security concerns that the Chinese government may be able to access customer information. Huawei, which had been the preferred supplier of the hi-end technology for next generation UK telecoms networks, has always denied the allegations. BT estimated that the work removing and replacing the technology from alternative suppliers would cost the telecoms group £500m. At the time, Philip Jansen, the former chief executive of BT, said that the company would have “no problem” meeting the 31 December deadline. “All 4G and 5G data sessions and voice calls are now delivered by non-Huawei core equipment – meaning that over 99% of all core traffic is now being served by non-Huawei kit,” said a BT spokesman. The remaining 1% of data that is yet to be migrated off of Huawei tech is on EE’s old 2G and 3G networks. BT said the process of removing Huawei kit from the core of its networks, which involves migrating 30 million active customers, has been “unprecedented in terms of scale, cost and complexity”. Companies that miss the year-end target could be fined as much as 10% of their revenue, or £100,000 for every day they aren’t compliant, although officials are likely to look leniently on the timeline for completion of such a complex task. Virgin Media O2 has said it has removed all the required equipment from its broadband and mobile networks. Vodafone has said that it did not have Huawei kit in its core networks. The government is allowing Huawei to be involved in the non-core parts of the UK’s 5G network, the masts and towers, but with a 35% cap on use of the Chinese company’s equipment which must be met by 2027.     12.12pm GMT  Chip equipment maker ASML forced to stop some exports to China as tech battle escalates  Chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML has been ordered by the Dutch government to restrict the shipment of some of its exports to China, prompting Beijing to urge the Netherlands to “respect market principles”. The company said that the “partial revocation” of its export licence, which affects several lines of its state-of-the-art laser lithography machines which are crucial in the mass production of microchips, said the ban would only affect a “small number of customers in China”. The move comes ahead of new restrictions coming into effect at the end of January, after the Netherlands followed the US and Japan in imposing strict curbs on technology exports. In a statement the company said that after discussions with the US government it has “obtained further clarification of the scope and impact of the US export control regulations”. The company added: “We do not expect the current revocation of our export license or the latest US export control restrictions to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023.” Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged the Netherlands “to be impartial, respect market principles and the law, take practical actions to protect the common interests of both countries and their companies and maintain the stability of international supply chains”.     11.21am GMT  Bitcoin surges to 21-month high topping $45,000 on hopes of wider trading  Bitcoin hit a 21-month high of just over $45,000 as investors hope that US regulators will give the greenlight to the wider trading of the world’s largest cryptocurrency and its rivals. Bitcoin hit an intra-day high of $45,532 (£35,737) on Monday night, the highest level since April 2022, and the first time it has traded above the $45,000 mark since then.  Traders, who drove big big price gains for bitcoin all last year, are excited at the prospect that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). This would open the market to allow investors to buy a product that tracks the share price of bitcoin without actually having to own the cryptocurrency.  Investors are also awaiting the impact of a process known as “halving”, where every few years the reward offered to miners is slashed, which reduces the market supply and has historically resulted in share price rises. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said:  “After the heavy selling in 2022, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been enjoying a resurgence and it feels like the crypto winter is over,” “After rallying over 150% in 2023, bitcoin continues its ascent. Growing hopes that US regulators will approve a bitcoin ETF are providing a tailwind to the cryptocurrency. The upcoming bitcoin halving event is also creating a lot of excitement among crypto investors. Historically bitcoin prices have picked up following a halving event.”      10.51am GMT  UK manufacturing production declines for 17th successive month  The UK manufacturing sector declined for a seventeenth successive month in December, capping a dismal year marked by job cuts and falls in new orders and output. The latest flash estimate fromm the S&P Global/CIPS purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell back to 46.2 in December - a score of 50 represents the neutral mark - having hit a six-month high in November.  The flash report also found that business optimism fell to a 12-month low in December “reflecting a faltering economy, client closures and high interest rates” Caroline Litchfield, partner and head of manufacturing and supply chain sector at Brabners, said:  “December was reflective of a dismal year for the sector. Nevertheless, many manufacturers are optimistic for the year ahead as fresh stimuli – including the Government’s £4.5 billion advanced manufacturing pot and regional Investment Zones – create more fertile grounds for investment.”   UK #manufacturing PMI fell back to 46.2 in December from 47.2 in November, remaining below the neutral 50 mark for the 17th month running... 😦(Fortunately, the service sector is doing much better, so the composite PMI is back above 50) pic.twitter.com/R7abxsGvdR— Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) January 2, 2024      10.25am GMT  Food inflation falls to 18-month low but retail bosses warn on acceleration risks  The rate of food price inflation fell to an 18-month low in December, but retail bosses have warned that there is a risk that the rate could rise again this year. Grocery price inflation fell from 7.7% in November to 6.7% last month, the lowest level since June 2022, helped by falls in the price of wine, port and sherry before Christmas. Fresh food inflation also fell to 5.4% in December, compared to 6.7% the previous month, according to new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). However, overall shop price inflation remained static at 4.3% because non-food products had a “challenging December” with price inflation rising to 3.1% from 2.5% in November. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, warned that shop prices are at risk of accelerating again this year. “Retailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down in 2024, but there are obstacles on the road ahead. New border checks for EU imports, hundreds of millions more on business rates bills from April. Government should think twice before imposing new costs on retail businesses that would not only hold back vital investment in local communities, but also push up prices for struggling households.” My colleague Sarah Butler has the full story here.     9.31am GMT  Digital bank Chase UK targets profitability next year as savers look for deals  Chase UK, the digital bank launched by US giant JP Morgan two years ago, could reach profitability as soon as next year as savers hunt around for the most competitive deals in the market. Canary Wharf-based Chase UK, which launched in 2021 with the goal of challenging the UK banking sector still dominated by a handful of high street lenders, said that it has attracted more than two million customers and manages around £15bn in deposits. “We’ve been building the bank rapidly, so we believe that we can bring the UK business to profitability in 2025,” said Shaun Port, managing director of Chase UK, speaking to the Press Association. “We want to be a major player in the UK banking scene, and to do that, we obviously need to make banking with Chase compelling.” In November, Daniel Pinto, president of JP Morgan, said that he expected the UK bank to break even in the next 12 to 18 months - at least two years earlier than previously expected. JP Morgan had warned that losses from the UK digital bank would be about $450m (£352m) in 2022, and had estimated estimated a similar amount for last year. Port said that Chase UK is “efficient” and “careful on costs” as it moves the loss-making business toward profitability. He added that there is a “clear desire to be more resilient” among customers, with people more actively managing their finances, including by transferring their monthly salary into accounts with higher interest and then moving money out to cover major bills. “The banking sector is in good health, but people can do more to earn more from their money, rather than just leave it with their existing provider and getting very little on their savings,” he said. Chase UK is set to offer credit cards this year as it looks to further expand its consumer products. Chase is also reportedly looking to launch in Germany and other European Union countries this year.  Updated at 9.44am GMT    8.38am GMT  Oil prices rise after Iran sends warship to the Red Sea after Houthi ship attacks  The price of oil has surged by almost 2% in the first trading session of the New Year, after Iran sent a warship into the Red Sea. The price of Brent Crude rose to almost $79 a barrel in early trading as tensions continue to rise in one of the world’s most vital shipping routes. Iran sent a warship to the Red Sea following the US Navy’s sinking of three Houthi boats, killing 10 militants, to repel an attack on a Maersk container vessel over the weekend. Attacks on boats transiting the route by Houthi rebels out of Yemen has forced shipping companies to use the alternative and much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead of risking using the Suez canal to enter the Mediterranean Sea. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, says:  “The prospect of escalating conflict in the region threatens energy supply stability through the important shipping channel, not to mention global economic activity, if it sparks broader hostilities through the Middle East.”   Global oil prices surged around 2% on 1st trading session of 2024 amid supply disruptions following a conflict in the Red Sea and expectations of a strong economic stimulus in China, the top crude importer.Brent #crude at $78.33 per barrel (+1.95%)https://t.co/ulzx85tcu6 pic.twitter.com/QvJudQSBqR— Mettis Global (@MettisGlobal) January 2, 2024  Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, the world’s fifth biggest container company, said that it will continue to re-route its vessels around southern Africa until at least 9th Janaury.  Updated at 1.02pm GMT    8.09am GMT  Introduction: Aldi and Lidl enjoy record Christmas sales as shoppers seek to stretch festive budgets  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Aldi and Lidl enjoyed record Christmas sales as shoppers turned to discount chains to stretch household budgets over the festive season amidst the cost of living crisis. Aldi said that sales topped £1.5bn for the first time in the four weeks to Christmas Eve, with sales up 8% year-on-year, and has pledged to cut prices to keep up the pressure on rivals. Meanwhile, Lidl said that its deluxe product range underpinned a 12% year-on-year sales increase in December, as shoppers sought a “touch of luxury at lower prices”. Both chains said that Friday 22nd December, the last weekday before Christmas, proved to be a record trading day with Aldi, the UK’s fourth biggest chain, saying 2.5m customers used its stores for their full festive shop. Last week, consumer card spending figures from Barclays showed that discount supermarket chains accounted for an all-time high 15.5% grocery spending last year, up a percentage point on 2022, as consumers looked for ways to reduce the cost of their weekly shop. “The German discounters which are best known for their rock bottom prices have enjoyed a stellar Christmas amid the cost-of-living crisis as price sensitive consumers trade down to Aldi and Lidl’s attractively priced offering,” said Victoria Scholar, head oof investment at Interactive Investor. “The two supermarkets have intensified price competition in the UK, prompting other supermarkets to offer discounts and promotions and think of innovative ways to drive customer demand such as a renewed focus on their loyalty schemes.” The agenda  9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing report for December 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI report for December 2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI report for December   Updated at 9.09am GMT "

        "content": "Britain’s factories started the year on a weaker footing after 17 consecutive months of contraction, as higher borrowing costs and a slump in demand took their toll. Factory output fell by more than expected in December after a drop in orders from domestic and export clients, according to the latest snapshot from S&P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. In a survey of about 650 manufacturers, which is closely watched by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the economy, company bosses said a worsening economic backdrop, clients delaying orders and poor weather conditions had contributed to the latest decline. The reading on the S&P Global/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) weakened to 46.2 in December, ending a run of three months of improvement and down from a seven-month high of 47.2 in November. The gauge of business activity remained below the 50 mark, which separates growth from contraction, for the 17th consecutive month. It comes as manufacturers come under mounting pressure from higher borrowing costs after 14 consecutive increases in the Bank of England base rate since December 2021. Demand for manufactured goods has also fallen back amid a slowdown in international trade and as households grapple with the cost of living crisis. Rob Dobson, the director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said demand in the manufacturing sector remained “frosty” at the end of 2023. “The downturn has hit manufacturers’ confidence, which dipped to its lowest level in a year, and encouraged renewed cost caution with further cuts to stock levels, purchasing and employment. “With concerns about high interest rates and the cost of living crisis hurting demand, the outlook for manufacturers in the months ahead remains decidedly gloomy.” Lower demand from key trading partners in the US, mainland China, mainland Europe and Canada led to a drop in new export business in December, while job losses were recorded for a 15th consecutive month as businesses pushed to make cost savings. Business optimism among manufacturers dipped to a 12-month low, reflecting a faltering economic outlook and higher borrowing costs. However, S&P Global and CIPs said companies still expected average production volumes to increase over the coming year. City investors are betting the Bank will be forced to launch a sharp round of interest rate cuts this year as inflation continues to fall back from the highest level in decades and the economy struggles for growth momentum. Financial markets are pricing in as many as six interest rate cuts from the current level of 5.25% to about 3.75% by December. Highlighting the pressure on companies, the Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index, which measures business leader optimism and prospects for the UK economy, fell back to -28 in December from -21 in November. Roger Barker, the director of policy at the IoD, said the Bank cutting interest rates could help to “kickstart business confidence” over the coming months. “With inflationary pressures abating, business is in dire need of a boost if it is to help drive meaningful economic growth in 2024.” Separate figures from the financial services sector compiled by the accountancy business KPMG showed a recovery in confidence among companies despite continued worries over high inflation and interest rates. According to a survey of senior executives in banking, insurance, and asset management, a majority of 87% said they were confident about overall business growth in the first quarter. However, more than half said persistent inflationary pressures would still pose the biggest challenge for their business, followed by 46% citing higher borrowing costs as the most pressing challenge. Karim Haji, the global and UK head of financial services at KPMG, said: “It’s great to see financial services leaders go into the new year feeling confident despite ongoing economic turbulence, which is set to continue to challenge the sector in the first quarter.” "

        "content": "If 2023 marked the likely tail end of the fastest rise in interest rates in three decades, this year will reveal just how hard the economy’s landing will be. To be sure, households trying to get by on jobseeker at $54 a day or $43 for the youth allowance could argue the economy has not been airborne for them for years. “People on low incomes have been pushed to the absolute brink, forced to make impossible choices between feeding themselves, paying their rent or turning the lights on,” says Edwina MacDonald, the acting chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service. The September quarter national accounts showed overall consumption had stalled. Excluding inflation, household disposable income was down by 5.6% over the year and 8.3% below its peak two years earlier, according to the Commonwealth Bank’s head of Australian economics, Gareth Aird. A snapshot of available data so far for the October-December period “suggests we may see an outright contraction in GDP over the quarter”, Aird says. But those grim tidings for the year’s end tell only part of the tale. The end of 2023 may be close to the nadir in this part of the economic cycle and, barring an unforeseen blow, an upswing shouldn’t be far behind. Government’s outlook upbeat That employers ignored the Reserve Bank’s November rate rise to add more than 61,000 staff shows there is still momentum in the labour market. Home prices, too, reversed an early drop during 2023 to end the year close to or above previous highs bolstering at least the paper wealth of owners. The government’s midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), released on 13 December, revealed the budget to be in unexpectedly rude health with a second straight surplus in range for the first time since 2007-08.   Related: Australia’s economy 2023 report: how it started v how it’s going   Few peer nations are as well placed. New Zealand recently increased its projected budget deficit by more than half for the year to next June and has delayed a return to surplus until 2026-27. The UK government borrowed almost £100bn ($190bn) in the half-year to October and the US clocked up a US$314bn (A$450bn) deficit in November alone – the most ever for that month. The Myefo, though, was also more upbeat than the May budget about how much the global economy would support Australia’s GDP. Net exports should add a full percentage point to growth in 2023-24 – rather than the 0.5 percentage points expected seven months earlier. That revision was significant, given annual GDP was only tipped to expand by 1.75%. A forecast improvement on the trade front buoyed the 2024-25 outlook even more. GDP growth was unchanged at 2.25% but the net exports contribution will jump from zero to 0.75 percentage points, according to Treasury’s model. Overseas inflation trends also look like helping. US inflation has continued to decline. China’s producer prices sank by 3% in November, indicating the world’s biggest exporter will include deflation in what it ships abroad. A year ago, many forecasters were predicting the RBA would end 2023 with rate cuts. Their prognostications hinged in part on inflation falling faster than it has. The economy would also be skirting recession by now, many thought. As it happened, both inflation and growth turned out to be higher than they tipped, with Opec oil supply cuts and the later Israel-Hamas war pushing up energy prices. But just as Myefo presumably gives the government scope to increase support for consumers and businesses if needed, the RBA has the capacity to start cutting the cash rate from its 12-year high of 4.35% to help counter any sudden downturn. As it stands, markets are already fully pricing in the first 25-basis point cut by June, according to the ASX rates tracker. Overseas trends may be helpful too. The US Federal Reserve is now tipped to start cutting its main interest rate in 2024. Such a move would give the RBA cover to do the same without worrying about a fall in the Australian dollar jacking up the cost of imports and slowing the decline of our inflation. Economy not slowing down Deutsche Bank’s Phil O’Donoghue remains among the more hawkish of Australian-based economists, being the sole surveyed expert to predict the RBA would raise the cash rate in December. He predicts that increase will now come when the board next meets in February but will be followed by four cuts, or a full percentage point, to bring the cash rate to 3.6% by the end of this year as inflation slows. O’Donoghue believes Australian households can absorb the higher borrowing costs so far.   Related: Jim Chalmers’ lucky budget surplus is no comfort to workers whose pay is shrinking | Greg Jericho   “Australian households still have about $180bn in excess Covid-era savings,” he says. “[Given] current levels of household debt and interest rates, the savings pool would cover the national mortgage interest bill for about six quarters.” The RBA, too, is monitoring financial stress. In December Andrea Brischetto, the head of its financial stability unit, found fewer than 2% of borrowers were having to cope with both an income shortfall and a small savings buffer. One factor that helped to keep the economy expanding in 2023 was the jump in population, including a record net 518,000 migrants in the year to June. (Per capita GDP has been flat or in retreat for three quarters.) According to Myefo, net migration will drop to 375,000 this fiscal year. That will still be 60,000 more than factored into the May budget. For 2024-25, it retreats to 250,000, or 10,000 people fewer than the budget predicted. That will be welcomed by those hoping for a slowdown in the cost of housing, whether for purchase or rent, but will remove one factor propelling GDP.  Still, economists such as Judo Bank’s Warren Hogan say the economy should remain on a “soft landing” track. The recent labour market figures “suggest the economy may prove resilient in 2024”. “It is hard to see a sharp downturn in the economy while employment and incomes are expanding,” Hogan says, and “there’s a lot of construction work going on” even after the government cut support for 50 infrastructure projects. “You don’t look at [the national accounts] and think the next step for the economy is another leg down.” Cherelle Murphy, EY Oceania’s chief economist, agrees. “The government sector doesn’t really look like it’s slowing down,” Murphy says. A lot of the states’ infrastructure spending “is actually ramping up into [this] year”. The need to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy – as emphasised by the energy market operator recently – should provide one “little bit of upside to [next year] 2024”, she says. Another may come from the expansion of the care economy, whether for the NDIS or an ageing population. Such industries tend to be jobs-rich and help to explain why Myefo and the RBA both project the unemployment rate to peak at 4.5% or less. As to how the RBA might act in 2024, Murphy notes the new governor, Michele Bullock, has stressed the central bank “is trying really hard not to destroy the economy by over-tightening” even as it reins in inflation. “They’re trying … something which has not really successfully been done in the past too many times,” she says. Perhaps 2024 will be one of those occasions."

        "content": "In the next four years, British entrepreneur Mansoor Hamayun expects to connect 36 million people to an electricity source, many for the first time. It is an ambition that would see his clean energy company, Bboxx, expand its reach tenfold across sub-Saharan Africa. The London-headquartered company has grown from an idealistic startup with hopes of transforming the lives of African households to a company offering pay-as-you-go solar power, batteries, smartphones and electric motorbikes to about 3.6 million people across Africa in little more than a decade. Now, a $100m (£78m) investment from EnerTech, a Kuwait-based investor, is about to spur its fastest growth yet. “Bboxx will turbocharge the impact we have on communities across sub-Saharan Africa,” Hamayun says. “Our shared vision is to transform the lives and livelihoods of our customers by giving them access to clean and affordable energy, clean cooking, e-mobility and technology like smartphones, that genuinely unlock their potential, day by day.” Bboxx was founded by Hamayun and two university friends – Christopher Baker-Brian and Laurent Van Houcke – to gain a foothold in the enormous untapped energy potential that the African market represents. It is one of a growing number of companies pioneering a new approach to energy supply: off-grid and pay-as-you-go. Hamayun’s story began about 15 years ago with 60 households in Rwanda. Over the course of a summer, while studying at Imperial College London, he set up a charity that provided six villages with solar electricity for the first time. The project continues to generate power to this day. The project began as an “academic challenge”, he says. At the time about 1.6 billion people globally were without access to reliable sources of electricity – and these numbers threatened to spiral as population growth outpaced progress on the world’s sustainable development goals. Since then, the number of people living without access to electricity across Asia’s developing economies has plunged, while Africa has remained largely in the dark. About 570 million people on the continent do not have access to electricity, and another 840 million are connected to an unreliable grid. “Africa is the biggest unserved consumer market on earth,” says Hamayun. Bboxx offers simple solar and battery systems which can provide light and power to homes that have no access to a stable electricity grid. The company also offers clean cookers, electric water pumps, smartphones and electric motorbikes. The impact is often profound. Access to reliable electricity can provide the power to open small businesses, educate children and safeguard the ill or vulnerable. “It’s transformational,” Hamayun says. “Electricity is so fundamental to ensuring an acceptable quality of life. I met a customer in Kenya last year who was extremely proud that her daughter had just been accepted to a medical university. She said the ability to have lights continuously at home helped tremendously in educating her children. They worked so hard, but the fact that we contributed a little bit towards that outcome … well, it’s incredibly motivating for all of us.”  Interactive  A customer in Rwanda recently praised Bboxx for increasing the amount of milk his cow was able to produce. “And I couldn’t work out how we had influenced this man’s cow,” he laughs. “He explained that thanks to the electricity he was able to run a water pump for the first time; and more water for the cow means more milk. In hindsight, it all makes total sense.” The story has stayed with Hamayun as a reminder of the myriad, unexpected ways that electricity can alter the lives of those who access it for the first time. The Bboxx business model hinges on Africa’s telecoms boom and the widespread adoption of “mobile money” banking, which has made pay-as-you-go an accessible option for millions of people who could not afford a longterm pay-monthly contract. “People might not be able to pay $30 a month for a service, but they can afford to pay $1 a day. Yet a lot of service-based offerings still call for monthly billing. It’s a very western way of thinking.” Switching from kerosene lamps and stoves to solar power and clean cookers is often cheaper, too, says Hamayun. “People don’t realise it’s expensive to be poor in Africa. A lot of goods are more expensive there than in the UK. We’re offering a cheaper option on better terms.” Hamayun says Bboxx’s rivalry with similar companies is not in the battle for potential customers, but in the area of recruitment. “Where competition is fierce is in finding capital and talent,” he says. “There is a limited pool of money, which is smaller than what the size of the market requires.” Bboxx has the backing of Japanese utility giant Mitsubishi and France’s Engie, and has secured regional partnerships with major western energy companies including EDF to help increase their reach across the continent. For these major utilities Africa provides a testbed for a new, digital data-led energy system still in its infancy in the developed world. Already, the continent is “leapfrogging” the need for centralised fossil fuel power plants and costly grid systems by leaning on renewables and data, Hamayun says. “There really are no limits to the scale that you can grow in this market. Take Nigeria: it has a population of about 228 million people, but this is forecast to grow to 400 million by 2050. Already, its power grid is extremely unreliable, so the size of the challenge is enormous. But at the same time, it is a country with a young population that has the ability to change and adapt to new technology. “You have all of these factors at play at the same time, which makes Africa very exciting.” CV Age 35 Family Married with a “kid on the way” Education Masters of engineering, electrical and electronic engineering from Imperial College London Pay £300k + “other typical CEO stuff” Biggest career mistake “Not focusing on the culture of the business from Day Zero and maintaining it throughout” Best advice he has been given There is no shortcut to hard work Overused phrase Make the impossible, possible What he does to relax Socialising in all its forms.

The four years since a new deadly virus spread around the world from the Chinese city of Wuhan has been a catalogue of woe for the global economy. 2023 has been the first year since 2019 to be relatively shock-free, in the sense that there has been no repeat of the pandemic of 2020, the supply-chain bottlenecks of 2021 or the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The financial repercussions of conflict in Israel have, until this point, been limited to the region. But that may change. The global economy is still not in a good place as 2024 dawns. Here are a few things to look out for in the year ahead. 1. Central banks start to cut interest rates Higher interest rates from all the world’s big central banks (other than the Bank of Japan) have had the desired effect. Inflation is on its way down across developed economies and, so far, the side-effects of the medicine have not been as bad as feared this time last year. But with a slowdown under way in the US and recession a looming threat in the UK and the eurozone, attention is now focused on when borrowing costs will be cut and which central bank will be the first to move. Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, thinks the Fed might act more quickly than the European Central Bank even though the growth outlook in the eurozone is “significantly worse”. History and recent experience suggest the ECB is institutionally more hawkish than the Fed, he says. With UK inflation coming down faster than expected, the Bank of England will struggle to maintain its ultra-cautious approach to rate cuts for much longer. Markets are now pricing in as many as six interest rate cuts by December, forecasting a possible base rate drop from 5.25% to 3.75%. 2. A developing-country debt crisis Problems have been mounting for the world’s poorest countries since the start of the pandemic, with many trapped by a double whammy of weaker growth and rising interest rates. Countries that borrowed heavily in US dollars during the 2010s have seen their repayments soar to record levels in recent years and, according to the World Bank, in the past three years there have been 18 sovereign defaults – more than in the previous two decades combined. The list of countries struggling with their debts includes Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon and Pakistan. A debt relief scheme established by the G20 in 2020 has far offered only modest help to a small number of countries. The World Bank chief economist, Indermit Gill, said: “Record debt levels and high interest rates have set many countries on a path to crisis.” Argentina, led by the newly elected right-wing populist Javier Milei and with inflation above 140%, is a country to keep an eye on. 3. Pre-election tax cuts A budget aimed at garnering support for the government is a stone-cold certainty given how far behind the Conservatives are in the opinion polls. After cutting national insurance contributions in November’s autumn statement, Jeremy Hunt will follow up with a reduction in income tax in the budget. A general election must take place in the UK by January 2025 at the latest, but the Conservatives and Labour are already working on their manifestos in readiness for a possible snap poll in the spring. Hunt will be able to justify cutting tax because the government’s financial position is benefiting from falling market interest rates and lower inflation, which reduce debt interest payments. Even so, the budget sums will only add up on the assumption that there will be post-election cuts in public spending that the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank believes are unrealistic. Tough decisions loom early in the next parliament for whoever is chancellor. 4. A deepening US-China cold war Britain is not the only developed country on election watch in 2024. The US chooses its president in November and, as things stand, the race looks like being a rerun of the Joe Biden versus Donald Trump contest in 2020. Relations between the US and China are unlikely to improve whoever wins, because the world is splintering into rival blocs and spheres of influence. US growth is likely to disappoint in the first half of 2024 as past interest rate increases feed through, while China’s post-lockdown recovery is flagging. Beijing is grappling with some big problems: a troubled property sector, rising youth unemployment, weak European demand for its exports, and an increasingly protectionist US. If anything, the cold war between the two biggest economies is likely to get frostier in 2024 as both the US and China turn inwards. The biggest risk is that the cold war turns hot with a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,– something that would dwarf the war between Russia and Ukraine in terms of its economic impact. 5. The unstoppable rise of generative AI One of the areas where competition between the US and China is fiercest is the race to develop generative AI – technology that can produce text, videos and other forms of content almost instantaneously. Many experts see generative AI as the successor to steam power, electricity and the internet: a general purpose technology that will transform economies and societies. Generative AI arrived with a bang in 2023 and its rapid growth will continue in 2024. On the plus side, AI has the potential to lift countries out of a prolonged period of lowproductivity, with the biggest gains to those that move fastest. On the debit side, there are concerns that the implications of AI have not been thought through, with “smart machines” potentially leading to a concentration of wealth and power, disrupting labour markets, influencing elections and even posing an existential threat to humans. A feature of the year ahead will be policymakers grappling with the regulatory challenges posed by the new technology. These include ensuring that the benefits are not concentrated in the hands of a few big tech companies; reskilling workforces; and the use of generative AI to create fake content. 6. Rising oil prices A disruptive oil shock was the dog that didn’t bark in 2023. When Hamas chose the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war to launch its attack on Israel, there were fears of a surge in the price of crude to match that seen in late 1973, but it didn’t happen. The price of a barrel of benchmark Brent crude rose initially – from $84.58 to a peak of just under $94 – before falling back amid hopes that the war will be confined to Gaza. But in recent weeks there have been signs of a broader Middle East conflict developing. BP has suspended shipments of oil through the Red Sea after attacks on ships by Houthi rebels from Yemen. Two of the world’s biggest container operators, AP Møller-Mærsk and Hapag-Lloyd, have sent ships on a longer route around Africa after the action by the Iran-backed militants. The risks are clear. About 10% of crude passed through the Red Sea in the first half of 2023, while closure of the Strait of Hormuz would choke off about 20% of global supply. The global economy is less dependent on oil than it was five decades ago but a prolonged disruption to supply would push crude prices up above $100 a barrel and lead to a fresh rise in inflation."

        "content": "Super-rich overseas property hunters are increasingly buying luxurious apartments with private security because of concerns about their personal safety, a study has found, as sales of homes over £15m in London rose in 2023. Wealthy people are buying newly built flats in “high-security super-luxury apartment buildings offering concierge security and amenities” in some of the capital’s most affluent neighbourhoods, according to the research by the high-end estate agency Beauchamp Estates and property service LonRes.   Related: UK property market: what will happen to house prices and mortgage rates in 2024?   The study found that flats in Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Hyde Park and Whitehall were selected, rather than houses, amid heightened “concerns over personal security and privacy”. Billionaire and multimillionaire buyers spent a combined £1.3bn on 54 luxury London properties selling for more than £15m each in the 2023 calendar year, up from £1.05bn on 49 properties in 2022. The buyers were mostly from the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE or China. There was a 137% increase in the number of “super-luxury new-build London apartments” sold for over £15m to 19 worth a combined £385m. This was an increase from eight worth £181m in 2022. The super-rich have been warned by their advisers that they could soon expect people with “pitchforks and torches” coming to look for them unless they do more to use their fortunes to help the millions struggling with the cost of living crisis. At an investment conference organised by Spear’s wealth management magazine, members of the global elite and their financial teams were last year warned by progressive advisers that there was a “real risk of actual insurrection” and “civil disruption” if the yawning inequality gap between rich and poor was allowed to widen as a result of energy and food price rises hitting squeezed households. The wealthy are prepared to pay considerably more for apartments than houses on a per sq ft basis, according to the research, which analysed Land Registry filings. Super-prime apartments sold for an average of £4,306 per sq ft compared with £3,011 per sq ft for houses. One apartment in Mayfair sold for more than £8,000 per sq ft. There was a flurry of luxury house sales in the final weeks of the year, which Beauchamp Estates said was probably due to “when many wealthy overseas families are in London during late November and December doing Christmas shopping in Harrods, Selfridges, Sloane Street and Bond Street they also take the opportunity to visit trophy homes in the UK capital and agree major property deals”. The agency added: “Just like domestic high-street shoppers identifying want to purchase but taking their time before they actually buy the world’s super-rich have waited for the Christmas sales before doing a flurry of big purchases in London’s trophy real estate market.” Just before Christmas, the Indian billionaire Adar Poonawalla, known as “the vaccine prince” because of his family’s vast vaccine factories, agreed to buy a house in Mayfair for £138m. Poonawalla’s Serum Life Sciences company is buying Aberconway House, which at 25,000 sq ft is 24 times the size of the average English home, from the daughter of the late Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk. Poonwalla is familiar with the house, having rented it from Kulczyk’s daughter for £50,000-a-week since 2021. However, the UK’s two most expensive properties on the market have failed to sell. They are 2-8A Rutland Gate, a 45-room “private palace” overlooking Hyde Park, whose owners are looking for bids in the region of £200m, and The Holme, a 40-bedroom house set in four acres of Regent’s Park, which is on the market for £250m."

        "content": "Shop prices continued to rise at 4.3% in December as a price rise on non-food items offset easing costs on food. The increase in the price of goods in stores compared with a year ago was the same rate of inflation as in November and came after several months of easing. Retailers warned that new border checks on EU goods entering the UK, which are due to begin from April, could further push up prices.   Related: Britons cut back on dining out and buying clothes, Barclays reveals   From 30 January, imports of items including some animal products, plants and plant products, and high-risk food of non-animal origin from the EU will require health certificates, followed by physical inspections of these goods at the UK border from the end of April. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium trade body that represents most big retailers, said: “Retailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down in 2024, but there are obstacles on the road ahead [including] new border checks for EU imports, [and] hundreds of millions more on business rates bills from April. “Government should think twice before imposing new costs on retail businesses that would not only hold back vital investment in local communities, but also push up prices for struggling households.” Analysts have also warned that the rise in the legal minimum wage, due to come in from April, will also keep up pressure on prices. Dickinson said non-food products had a “challenging December” with price inflation rising to 3.1% from 2.5% in November as prices bounced back after Black Friday discounts and before the January sales. Food price inflation decelerated to 6.7% in December – the lowest level since June 2022 and down from 7.7% in November – helped by falls in the price of wine, port and sherry before Christmas. Fresh food inflation also fell to 5.4% in December from 6.7% in the previous month. The overall rise in prices came despite widespread discounting on the high street as retailers tried to clear stocks of clothing after a mild autumn. Hard-pressed consumers have also been cutting back on buying new clothes to prioritise spending on travel, entertainment and trips to the pub over the past year, according to the latest data from Barclays. Despite the problems, Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said price cuts on clothing had been mitigated by a “disciplined market” – indicating that retailers had been cautious about the amount of goods they ordered. Mike Watkins, the head of business insight at analysts NielsenIQ, said promotions on food were at a four-year high as there was “a lot of pressure on discretionary spend” as households struggled with higher bills on essentials such as energy and petrol. With families closely watching their budgets, supermarkets battled to win over the big Christmas shop by offering discounts on key festive meal items, from sprouts to turkeys. Bags of carrots and other veg could be bought as cheaply as 15p in the week before Christmas."

        "content": "The grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl both rang up their best ever Christmas sales performance in the UK as shoppers sought ways to save cash during the cost of living crisis. Lidl’s sales rose 12% in the four weeks to Christmas, helped by an 11% rise in sales of the chain’s premium Deluxe own-label foods, while sales of its Montaudon brut champagne doubled. The German-owned chain said 4.5 million people visited its tills in the run-up to Christmas. Popular products included its own-brand Christmas jumper, sales of which were up 40%.   Related: UK grocery inflation sticks at 4.3% despite lower food price rises   The supermarket is likely to have grown faster than all of its rival grocers over Christmas, continuing its run from November. At Aldi, sales rose by 8% to top more than £1.5bn in the four weeks to Christmas for the first time. The grocer said the strong figures topped a year in which it had attracted half a million more shoppers as they switched away from mainstream supermarkets including Tesco and Sainsbury’s. The retailer said its customers had bought 42m pigs in blankets. Alternatives to the traditional turkey were popular, with 25% more Specially Selected gammon joints popped into baskets. Lidl and Aldi had their busiest ever day of trading on Friday 22 December. The stock market-listed supermarkets Tesco and Sainsbury’s are due to report how they fared in the run-up to Christmas next week as part of the annual flood of festive retail figures, which escalates on Thursday when the fashion and homewares chain Next reports. Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, promised to continue lowering the cost of groceries, and said the retailer was “really grateful that so many customers chose Aldi for their main Christmas shop this year”. Ryan McDonnell, the chief executive of Lidl in Great Britain, said: “I’m incredibly proud of our performance this Christmas in what was the busiest trading period in our history. As the fastest-growing supermarket in the country, we welcomed more customers through our doors than ever before. “Deluxe proved to be a standout winner this Christmas, with record-breaking sales, as we saw customers not only start their festive celebrations early but trade up to premium lines across all categories.” The strong trading figures come after industry data showed that Aldi and Lidl gained market share in November while Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose and the Co-op lost out. Tesco and Sainsbury’s, the UK’s two biggest supermarkets, gained share as they offered loyalty card holders additional discounts. Grocery discounters have fared well during the cost of living crisis as households look for ways to save money after energy bills, petrol and household goods have risen in price. In the past year, shoppers have been switching to the discounters, as well as buying more own-label goods, to offset hefty food price inflation, which was 6.7% in December, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium. The discount retailers have experienced a bounce-back after a tough time during the Covid pandemic when many shoppers chose to buy more groceries online, a service that the cut-price grocers do not usually offer as they cannot do so profitably. Aldi and Lidl have taken a bigger slice of grocery sales by opening dozens of stores each year, while the big chains are opening just a handful of large outlets. Lidl has 960 stores and Aldi 1,010, and both have plans to expand much further."

        "content": "Oil prices have risen sharply after Iran rejected calls to end support for attacks by Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea and sent a warship to the key trading route. In the first trading session of the new year, Brent crude rose $1.73, or more than 2%, to $78.77 a barrel on Tuesday, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $73.36 a barrel, up $1.71, or 2.4%. Prices were driven higher by fears of supply disruption amid the tensions in the Red Sea, which leads to the Suez Canal.    Related: Aldi and Lidl enjoy record Christmas sales; Red Sea tensions lift oil price - business live   Some shipping companies have paused sailings on the route in favour of the longer trip around the tip of Africa. Rerouting the vessels adds expense and up to 20 days to deliveries for shipping companies. On Tuesday, Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, which had a ship attacked near Yemen last month, said it would continue to divert its vessels away from the Suez Canal and around the Cape of Good Hope until at least 9 January for security reasons. Other companies are expected to follow suit. As of 29 December, 166 vessels had been rerouted and 28 heading for the Suez Canal were paused, according to the supply chain advisory group Project 44. It said daily traffic volumes in the canal were on average 55% lower than before the attacks. Oil prices were also supported by hopes of strong demand over China’s spring festival holidays in February and economic stimulus in the country, which is the top importer of crude.  Interactive  A Reuters survey of economists and analysts predicted that the average price of Brent crude would be $82.56 a barrel this year, compared with the 2023 average of $82.17, as they expect global tensions to remain but demand to be capped by weak global growth. The rise in the wholesale cost of oil could ultimately push up prices for UK drivers at the pump. Iran state media reported that the Alborz destroyer crossed the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and entered the Red Sea on Monday but did not specify its mission except to say that it periodically conducted operations in the Red Sea in order to secure shipping routes. The move comes as the UK is reportedly considering airstrikes on Houthi rebels and the US said its navy sank three boats that had been targeting a container ship in the Red Sea. The US said its helicopters had fired at four boats from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen that had attacked a commercial vessel owned by the shipping company Maersk. On Sunday, Maersk said its crew was safe and it would pause all shipping in the Red Sea for 48 hours. The incident was the latest of nearly 20 attacks that have led some shipping companies to abandon the Red Sea route altogether. This month a Royal Navy destroyer joined international efforts to deter attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea. HMS Diamond joined American and French warships in a US-led taskforce called Operation Prosperity Guardian."

        "content": "A fitter working for the furniture chain Sharps Bedrooms is taking legal action for better employment rights in a case that could open the door to improving conditions and pay for thousands of gig economy workers fitting kitchens, bathrooms and cupboards for big chains. David Lockwood, who has been classed as a self-employed independent subcontractor by Sharps, says he should instead bedefined as a worker – an official employment status which comes with benefits including holiday pay, statutory sick pay and the right to the legal minimum wage. It is understood that fitters working on kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms for other big brands are employed in a similar way.  The legal action comes before one of the busiest times for household furniture sellers, which launch a string of discounts to win over shoppers before the peak sales period in March. Lockwood, 58, has worked for Sharps, which is based in the Midlands, for about 30 years installing pre-made fitted furniture such as wardrobes and cupboards. He claims that the company denies him agency in his role, subjects him to financial penalties and denies him the right to carry out work for competitors – elements that could define him as a worker. He has enlisted the law firm Leigh Day to help fight his case. He says the company, for example, controls the dates, times and fees for his work and would impose a financial penalty if he did not give at least 72 hours’ notice if he could not attend a job. The action against Sharps, which has been owned by the UK private equity group Epiris since 2021, comes after a string of legal battles over the rights of workers in the gig economy. Ryan Bradshaw, a senior associate solicitor at Leigh Day, said: “David has been a loyal worker for Sharps Bedrooms Ltd for decades, yet the company treat him as a subcontractor and are in control of David’s work, setting the fees and parameters of his work. “Furthermore, they are allegedly assuring customers that David is a member of their staff, yet putting ‘subcontractor’ on his pay statements and terms of engagement.  “We hope that by bringing this legal claim, David’s employment status can be settled and he will have access to the holiday pay and sick pay that he is owed.” Lockwood said: “After working for 25-plus years in full-time service to Sharps Bedrooms, I feel totally failed and disrespected by them. I believe that they have used unlawful loopholes to take advantage of hard and loyal workers.” The case, which is being supported by Law for Change, a community interest company, is the latest to challenge the rights of works in the gig economy.  Law for Change was set up by the campaigning lawyer Stephen Kinsella to fund public interest cases that it believes will contribute to lasting social change. In 2021, Uber was forced to pay its drivers the minimum wage and holiday pay after the supreme court dismissed the ride-hailing app’s appeal against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers. However, the takeaway and groceries courier firm Deliveroo continues to class its UK riders as self-employed independent contractors after the supreme court upheld previous judgments that they could not be classed as workers because they had the right to arrange a substitute to perform their duties if they did not want to or were unable to. Gig economy employment status remains a grey area as ministers have failed to bring in a modern employment bill with more protections despite promising to introduce new legislation a number of times since reforms were first mentioned in the Queen’s speech in 2019. A spokesperson for Sharps said: “We disagree with the claims made by David Lockwood and Leigh Day and will be robustly challenging any legal action.”"

        "published_date": "2024-01-02T07:00:55+00:00",
        "content": "The owner of one of Britain’s biggest oil refineries has extended a loan facility with an arm of an oil company founded and part-owned by a Russian billionaire who is under sanctions. Essar Oil (UK), which owns and operates the Stanlow oil refinery near the River Mersey in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, stopped all imports of Russian fuel in 2022, in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. The decision came after unionised dockworkers refused to unload Russian cargoes at Stanlow, which supplies 16% of UK road fuel, while the government later imposed a ban on imports that might benefit the Kremlin. Recently filed accounts reveal that the company has extended a credit facility with Litasco, the oil trading division of Moscow-based Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company. Litasco itself is not subject to sanctions. Essar Oil (UK) – part of the Essar Group owned by the Indian billionaire Ruia brothers – has a $500m (£393m) “extended payment facility” on crude oil with Litasco, the accounts show. The agreement is effectively a credit line allowing Essar to buy fuel and pay later. The two-year deal came to an end in May 2023 but has been extended until June 2024, before the money is paid back under an “unwind and settlement” agreement. According to the accounts, $320m of a total $500m was due for repayment within 12 months as of the end of March 2023. Repayment will be funded by a combination of profits and new loans. Litasco is wholly owned by Lukoil, whose founder and 8.5% shareholder  was placed under sanctions by the UK in April 2022. In its statement of reasons for sanctioning him, the British government said: “Through his directorship of Lukoil, Alekperov continues to obtain a benefit from and/or continues to support the government of Russia by working as a director […] of entities carrying on business in sectors of strategic significance to the government of Russia, namely the Russian energy sector.” Lukoil is under sanctions in the US but not in the UK or EU, while Litasco is not under sanctions in any of the jurisdictions. Alekperov stepped down as a director of Lukoil shortly after he was placed under sanction but remains an 8.5% shareholder. A high court ruling handed down in November – part of a dispute between Litasco and a Senegalese oil company – found that neither Litasco nor Lukoil could be considered under the control of a sanctioned person. During that case, a company called Der Mond Oil and Gas Africa argued that Litasco should be treated as if it were designated for sanctions because it was under the control of either Alekperov or Vladimir Putin. Mr Justice Foxton dismissed this argument, noting that although Putin could take control of Litasco should he decide to do so, he did not exert any influence over the company. He added that it was “wholly improbable” that a payment made to Litasco would benefit Putin. A spokesperson for the company said: “EOUK took immediate action to stop all Russian diesel imports many months ahead of the government deadline and our peers in the sector, by identifying alternate sources and ramping up our own production. We do not import any fuel of Russian origin. “We operate at all times in line with sanctions legislation. Our focus now is very much on the massive opportunity presented by the energy transition and our ambition to become the world’s first low carbon refinery, while also making Stanlow the catalyst for the broader decarbonisation of the north-west.” Essar Oil (UK)’s loan arrangement with Litasco has previously raised concerns in Westminster because the contract gives the company a charge over Stanlow Terminals Ltd. In theory, this means the terminal, a vital piece of the UK’s energy infrastructure, could fall into Litasco’s hands if Essar Oil (UK) were to default on its debts. The impact of the pandemic on Essar’s finances led to disquiet among government figures about the arrangement in 2021, when the company was wrestling with debts to HM Revenue and Customs. Fears for its financial health persisted after its losses deepened from $221m to $321m in 2021. has always insisted that its finances are robust and that Litasco has no influence over the Stanlow terminal. It has since returned to profitability, reporting a $66m post-tax profit in 2023, largely because of a $56m tax credit."

There is “no question of the FT 30 index disappearing,” opined the deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, arguing that the new-fangled creation would sit happily alongside the paper’s own FT 30, the pre-eminent barometer of the UK stock market since 1935. It did not work out that way. The FTSE 100 grabbed attention from the off, just as its designers intended. It was created by the London Stock Exchange and the early players in the futures and options market for the then emerging era of electronic trading and derivative products. A catchy shorthand – the Footsie – helped. Companies’ pure stock market capitalisations dictated weightings within the index, as they still do, ensuring mathematical discipline and easy replication. A total of 100 constituents, updated quarterly, was adopted not only for the sake of a round number but also because 100 stock symbols was the maximum that could be displayed on a single page of the new Topic electronic information terminals that the exchange was flogging.  Interactive  The FT 30 did not stand a chance. Each stock in its narrow index was given equal weight, meaning weird upsets occurred if a single small company plunged in value. A selection based on a hand-picked sample of the UK economy, with prices updated only hourly, also felt woefully old-fashioned. In the era of privatisations (BT came in the first year of the Footsie) and big bang in 1986, the market wanted to trade more of everything listed in London. During Black Monday in 1987 – when the Footsie fell 10.8%, and then 12.2% the next day – the index and the colourful trading screens provided visuals for television. “When the market crashed, it flashed red. It captured the imagination not just of the media, but also of the investing public,” says Mark Makepeace, who spent 35 years building the exchange’s (now enormous) index business. The FT’s sniffiness in 1984 was because it had been carved out of the original talks. On day one – 3 January – the index was called the SE 100, with the initials standing for Stock Exchange. An irate FT muscled its way into the tent a few weeks later and the name became the FT-SE 100, with the hyphen eventually dropped. The FT 30 can still be found prices page of the paper (reading glasses advised), but it is a curiosity that has never interested funds that track indices. The score for the Footsie after four decades is a rise from 1,000 points at launch to 7,733, though that understates the total return because the constituents obviously paid dividends along the way. With dividends reinvested, a £1,000 investment in the Footsie in 1984 is now worth £22,550. If that sum sounds enormous, remember the powerful effect of compounding. The annualised rate from owning the Footsie for 40 years is slightly more than 8%, which comfortably outstrips inflation but is not Warren Buffett’s 20%-ish. Twenty-six companies survive from the original index, although some, such as Aviva and NatWest, are really reconstituted entities. The disappeared originals – names such as Hanson Trust, Hawker Siddeley and Trafalgar House – recall another age. The best years were the run to the turn of the century. On the last day of 1999, the height of the dotcom mania, the Footsie came close to 7,000, so another 773 points over the next 23 years represents slim pickings, dividends notwithstanding. But the designers’ aim of latching on to derivatives and indexed financial products has been a commercial triumph, as Makepeace chronicled in his book, FTSE. The rise of passive investing via exchange-traded funds and index funds has been the biggest development in global stock markets over the past 30 years. The FTSE International business that emerged a decade after the launch of the Footsie, and then became FTSE Russell via acquisition, is now a big component of the parent, the London Stock Exchange Group. It makes its money by selling real-time data to fund managers and other financial players, and via licensing fees. FTSE Russell is one of the big three index names, alongside MSCI and S&P, and offers indices in stocks and bonds around the globe. Low costs, choice and the ability to create new indices lie behind the revolution. “Indices are for the world of investing as recipes are for the world of cooking,” says David Sol, the head of policy and governance at FTSE Russell. The FTSE 100 itself, though, is showing its age. It contains some excellent long-term performers (see below) but is heavy in banks, insurers and international miners that rushed to London in the 1990s and early 2000 for the prestige of Footsie status. As such, it has become a symbol of how the 21st-century technology revolution has bypassed London. After years of consultations, reviews and regulatory tweaks, the exchange and the government are contemplating bigger reforms to attract high-growth firms, but the lobby to bring back Arm Holdings, a former Footsie star, failed. The Cambridge-based chip designer, which was bought by SoftBank in 2016, relisted in New York. The view of Makepeace, who left FTSE Russell four years ago, is instructive: “The FTSE 100 is at an inflexion point. The companies that make up the Footsie are the older industries. We face climate change and huge challenges ahead. If you look at the FTSE 100 in 40 years from now, it will look nothing like today’s index. London needs to open up and attract new companies. Technology is driving this and the US is a magnet for companies who are leaders in new technologies. “London has to think about the new industries of the next 20, 30 years. It used to be a strength of London to get those companies to list in the UK and get them to stick with the UK. It’s no good having a market made up of old industries because it will bring the others down.” How have the originals fared? Cigarettes and analytics win. From the original 100 members of the FTSE 100 index, only a quarter are still present in recognisable form. A few of those, including NatWest and Shell, have been through too many corporate reorganisations to allow meaningful data on 40-year compound returns for shareholders. But, within the measurable collection, two names stand out as top performers: British American Tobacco, returning 16.4% a year, and Relx, with 14.4%, according to the stock exchange’s data. The critical phrase in the calculation is “with dividends reinvested”. Over a period as long as 40 years, dividends can provide the fuel for the compounding effect, often a long-term investor’s best friend. That is especially the case with BAT, which has demonstrated that even declining industries can throw off huge quantities of cash. After a huge legal settlement with US regulators in 1998, the tobacco industry became a cash machine. Between 2000 and 2017, BAT’s share price – so ignoring dividends – rose tenfold. The performance will not feel so pretty for buyers at the top, however: the shares have since halved.  Interactive  The flyer in the pack, then, is really Relx, possibly the most quietly impressive performer among big UK-listed companies over the past 20 years. In 1984, the company was Reed International, a trade book and magazine publisher, and became Reed-Elsevier in 1993 via merger with a Dutch scientific publisher. The Relx name was adopted in 2015 and the company is now the ninth largest on the London market, worth £58bn, more than the rest of the FTSE 100 media sector combined. In reality, Relx is best thought of as an information and analytics firm with a specialism in scientific, legal and medical data – flagship businesses include the Lancet and LexisNexis. And it is rare in that it is already commercialising artificial intelligence in its products. The compounding effect in its case flows from a year in, year out ability to grow revenues faster than costs. The share price has risen almost sixfold in the past decade."

        "content": "There were contrasting reactions when the US rating agency Moody’s downgraded China’s A1 credit rating outlook from stable to negative last month. Financial markets, focused on the economy, paid it barely any attention. Chinese state media, looking at the politics, saw red. Global Times called it “biased and unprofessional”. A few days later, the Ministry of State Security issued a statement stipulating that the only purpose of “negative talk” was to doubt or deny China’s socialist system, and to contain its development. The Chinese Communist party’s prickly attitude to criticism is not uncommon. It chooses instead to propagate a narrative of continuous success in which its own role is pivotal. It recognises that China confronts big challenges nowadays, but attributes them to low confidence, thinks they are fleeting, and says they’ll be resolved in 2024. The reality, though, is that systemic problems have over the years become features in China’s $19 trillion economy. The real estate market has tipped over after an almost unbroken 20-year boom, which the government itself encouraged. At about a quarter of GDP, housing now faces years of shrinkage as it adjusts to chronic oversupply and lower household formation. Property developers, local governments and state enterprises have high levels of debt and many face debt service difficulties. The virtual absence of inflation reflects inadequate aggregate demand. Stalled productivity growth, the politicisation of regulation and the business environment, rapid ageing, high youth unemployment and inequality also figure prominently. It may seem churlish to draw attention to these things in the world’s second-largest economy, centre of global exports, manufacturing and supply chains, and home to brands such as Alibaba, Tencent and TikTok. Yet Japan, 30 years ago, reminds us that it is quite possible to have islands of technological excellence and leadership, and also deep economic imbalances, deflating asset bubbles, over-indebtedness, and institutional weaknesses that compromise growth and prosperity. Technological prowess could not prevent Japan from succumbing to its proverbial lost decades, and there is no reason to think differently about China. China’s 2024 outlook is likely to be more challenging than last year’s. The party will probably adopt a 5% GDP growth target again, but it may prove more elusive than 2023’s, which had Covid weakness in 2022 as a comparison. Last month, the annual Central Economic Work Conference set out priorities for 2024, including science and technology innovation, stronger demand, stability, rural development and integration, and low carbon and ecological investment. Yet the government also said that impediments to recovery remain, citing inadequate demand, overcapacity in several sectors, weak social expectations and “still numerous risks and hidden dangers”. Those expecting meaningful macroeconomic stimulus and reforms will continue to be disappointed. There will be some tax cuts and fee reductions for businesses and more support for the beleaguered housing market but only to stabilise the economy. Monetary and credit policies will remain “prudent”. There is no suggestion that the government will adopt serious measures to boost consumer demand and household incomes. It is reported to have decided instead to “strengthen economic propaganda and public opinion guidance, and promote a positive narrative of China’s economy”. In other words, cheerleading. It is easy to see why Xi Jinping was minded to meet Joe Biden in San Francisco in November. Both sides wanted to stabilise their most important external relationship, for a while at least, and Xi’s interest was clearly the economy. He also met EU Commission officials recently in Beijing to try to keep the EU close for trade and access to technology, but distant politically from the US. No one should be fooled into thinking, though, that the slight thaw with the US and EU amounts to more than expedience. Indeed, a new trade war threat looms on the horizon, not least with the EU. Chinese industrial policy, based around the proliferation of large-scale industrial funds and state subsidies and access to foreign technology has in the past resulted in excess capacity in sensitive areas such as steel and renewables, and is now being reflected in Chinese electric vehicle and battery production. The Chinese auto industry produces at less than 60% capacity utilisation, and exports about 12% of its current 27 million unit production, in which the share of electric vehicles is rising steadily. America’s 27.5% tariff on Chinese-made car imports make it a tougher market to crack. It is also trying to strengthen its own manufacturing capacity in new electric vehicles, renewables and semiconductors through the passage of the Inflation Reduction and Chips and Science Acts, and the imposition of export controls on sales of sensitive products to China. If Trump is re-elected in November, the bipartisan position regarding China would probably not change, but he might again emphasise trade policy as he did in his first term. Europe, where tariff rates are much lower, offers a much more fertile opportunity for Chinese exports of its cars and its overcapacity. To this end, the EU Commission has initiated an anti-subsidy investigation, which is liable to result in restrictions and tariffs on imports of electric vehicles made in China. German and other auto manufacturers are shuddering already in the face of the steep increase in imports of Chinese autos, especially electric vehicles. Faced with an array of domestic economic problems, China should ideally substitute market and structural reforms for the more familiar strategy of doubling down on already high manufacturing investment and exports. But it won’t. As a result, the economy will become still more unbalanced. This policy focus will trigger a new round of trade war as China’s industrialisation and export push forces the US and Europe to import more Chinese products and de-industrialise. The US, EU and other industrial countries will not go meekly to another deindustrialisation graveyard in this way.

        "content": "Nemuel DePaula has never been afraid of big pivots. The Brazil native immigrated to Boston at age 10, started his own graphic design business, Grita, while still in high school, and moved himself and the business across the country to Los Angeles in 2013. Four years later, DePaula took a gamble again with Lenita, the part-time mobile flower shop he launched and named after his mother.   Related: How can this matcha tea trader keep nurturing her business now that she’s expecting?   DePaula, 35, has been captivated by flowers since childhood. “The first thing I ever stole was a rose,” he said with a laugh as he recalled the perfect bloom he snipped from his neighbor’s garden and slipped to his mom as a small child. Over the years, his aesthetic sensibilities evolved from purloined roses to less conventional species. His latest love is the “graffiti anthurium”, a tropical flower with a natural paint-splattered effect that resembles a bloodied orchid – but in a cool way. For many years, DePaula operated under the assumption that his flower shop days would come much later in life. Instead, opportunity struck in the form of a used 1991 Dodge Aeromate truck he found on Craigslist. “In Los Angeles, food trucks are popular, and we’re blessed with the sun year-round,” DePaula said. “So I thought: why don’t I just take a stab at a weekend flower truck?” DePaula bought the vehicle for $6,000. He gave it a fresh coat of shell-pink paint, and took it out around Los Angeles on select Saturdays and Sundays. In addition to flowers, he sold handmade gifts by local artists as well as his own line of greeting cards and cheerfully branded Lenita merchandise, such as truck-shaped enamel pins and mod flower stickers. What began as a quirky side hustle eventually blossomed into DePaula’s full-time priority: a profitable business with a customer base of its own. The numbers are on his side: according to the market research firm Arizton, the US floral gifting market is predicted to grow from $12.25bn in 2022 to $18.9bn in 2028.   I really want to sell people more of an experience than just a product  Nemuel DePaula    Although DePaula continues to take occasional graphic design commissions, Lenita became his central focus this past May. With the help of three silent partners – two of whom are his twin brother and their 37-year-old sister – he opened Lenita’s first brick-and-mortar retail space in Los Angeles’s hip Highland Park neighborhood. The cozy storefront, which used to house a nail salon, is nestled between a bar and grill and a pizza parlor in a retail strip located across the street from the legendary art deco Highland Theater movie house. Committing to a storefront spurred more ideas and desires. DePaula wanted to scale the business beyond flowers and handicrafts. “I really want to sell people more of an experience than just a product,” he said. He’d already had a taste of causing a stir with his flower shop on wheels. “The truck already does that for us, just by being a flower truck. It’s very unexpected and unique,” he said of the vehicle that inspires people to snap photos for social media. Ensuring that a storefront would have a similar effect is a bigger lift. To create a similarly immersive retail experience, DePaula and his team of three part-time retail employees, a part-time events and communications coordinator, and a rotating crew of four to six freelancers are working to tap into Lenita’s potential as an event space. Customers can pay a fee to spend a few hours learning a new skill against the store’s flower-filled backdrop. Recent offerings include sessions on wreath making, flower arrangement and jewelry design.   Related: Lucy Yu’s thriving New York bookstore burned down. How can she rebuild without burning out?   From an operational standpoint, DePaula sees these workshops as serving a dual purpose: they provide the business with a supplementary revenue stream – workshop tickets cost anywhere from $75 to $185 a person – and the events attract new customers into the shop. Some of those customers might even make in-store purchases after class, or return when a friend has, say, a party or a ballet recital. Eventually, DePaula hopes that the craft workshops will be one among many additional in-person program offerings at Lenita; he’s thinking about things like artisan pop-up shops and artist installations. But while DePaula believes that workshops are what sets Lenita apart, he concedes that they may also be his small team’s biggest hurdle. “Getting regular people to come into the shop to do workshops is a cool idea, but how, exactly, do we do it?” he said. DePaula has struggled to broadcast the business’s offerings beyond flowers and goods. He and his team have two customer bases, and challenges to go with each of them. They have been careful not to stray far from their original purpose, for fear of alienating the original client base of flower truck fans who enjoyed the creative flower arrangements. They are also mindful of not turning off new customers who might balk at the store’s unorthodox offerings and artisanal pricing. “When you come into a shop that is sourcing flowers from local farms and is keeping the money within the community, but selling at a higher price point than the grocery store, people don’t always understand why,” DePaula said. As Lenita puts down its roots, DePaula must ultimately figure out how to continue to grow revenue in a way that feels true to his original vision. The Guardian asked three experts to consider DePaula’s predicament and share their advice.John Mullins Associate professor of management practice in marketing and entrepreneurship at the London Business School DePaula has already deftly positioned his business in such a way that offering workshops led by local crafters and artists will fit right in. He’s long been selling handmade gifts, and his flexible brand does not limit what he can sell in the same way as a brand with a name like, say, “Flower Power” would. Moving forward, DePaula should prioritize developing a regular monthly calendar so that his customers will know when to expect workshops to run. This can even be somewhat minimal at first. He should also focus on sourcing the right crafters and artists from the local community. DePaula needs to ask himself just a few questions to get started. First: what per-person price points will sell best, and at what times and days of the week? I recommend that he run some experiments and see what works. Second: what should be the revenue split between the partners and Lenita? My advice is to let the partners keep all their earnings. Finally: which local crafters and artists already have a local following? For this, I suggest he ask his regular customers who they’d like to see and what they’d like to make with their own hands. Puja Bhola Rios Chief revenue officer for Frame.io, and author of Get It Together: A Winning Formula for Success from the Boss You Need If I were DePaula, I would prioritize focusing on growing revenue and profit for the current business. Then I would think about the costs and potential strain of scaling the current business. Workshops would be my last priority. Everything boils down to the numbers. DePaula needs to establish how much revenue he is realistically expecting from workshops in order to determine whether they are worth the strain on his staff. In the meantime, he should focus on maximizing revenue in Lenita’s core competency. Does Lenita have an up-to-date website with online purchasing options? Has Lenita captured as much of the wedding, holiday and funeral market as it can? If the answer to either of these questions is no, he needs to address those gaps before expanding the business. As for the question of how to market Lenita’s new, expanded brand identity to both new and existing customers: until DePaula fully understands Lenita’s current numbers and has captured as much of the total addressable market that he and his team can, there is nothing to communicate yet. Vivian Tu Former equities trader, personal finance content creator and author of Rich AF: The Money Mindset That Will Change Your Life The first step is to figure out which part of his business brings the most revenue. Since flowers are the main component of the business, my guess is that they are likely also the top moneymaker. I’d advise using the top moneymaker to fund the expansion of the business and brand. The second and most important step is to figure out who Lenita’s customer base is and target specific activations, add-ons and events that cater to their interests. For singles or romantic buyers, he could host a speed-dating event. For event buyers, he could host a wedding planning seminar for couples and vendors looking to meet future clientele. The third step is to look at logistics. I noticed after a quick internet search that Lenita is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Maybe DePaula could consider turning Lenita into a co-working space on those days, which would only require a few modular tables and chairs and a strong wifi connection, and would not demand heavy human capital. Because Lenita is such a physically beautiful space, he could also consider using a site like Peerspace to allow people to rent out the store for photoshoots outside of standard business hours. This approach would have the added benefit of organic marketing. The fourth and final step is to take advantage of social media to expand brand identity. DePaula can geo-target folks who live in the Los Angeles area and keyword-target people whose interests align with the customer demographics. I’d focus on creating short-form video content, which is what most online platforms are prioritizing these days, maybe about florals or the events he plans on hosting. It could also be a great opportunity to collaborate with local creators. The choice Mullins’ plan resonated most. “I think overall he seemed to understand the brand a bit better, to understand that we’re going beyond flowers,” DePaula said. DePaula was particularly struck by Mullins’ suggestion that he maintain a monthly events calendar. When he began running the truck side of his business, DePaula gleaned the importance of tending to an up-to-date schedule with adequate advance notice for letting customers know where and when to find the mobile shop. “At first, we would just kind of figure out where we were going to be a few days in advance, and then people couldn’t really plan,” he said. “Then we started doing calendars monthly and we realized, hey, the longer people know about the pop-ups, the better it is. That’s something I think we can definitely apply to the workshops.” DePaula also appreciated Mullins’ point that the shop’s scheduled offerings can be minimal at first as the team figures out what works. He plans to apply this scheme to future event scheduling. DePaula was also intrigued by Mullins’ suggestion that Lenita allow its creative partners to keep all of their workshop earnings. While DePaula doesn’t think that this is a feasible step for his business to take right now, he sees it as a possibility for future months when the shop is more firmly established. “This enriches our community, expands our offerings, supports local artists and gets people inside the shop,” DePaula said. “A workshop attendee might grab a bloom or merch on their way out, but even if they don’t, it will make them think of Lenita next time they need florals or a gift. It’s about building relationships – with our partners and our customers.”"

        "published_date": "2024-01-01T11:03:11+00:00",
        "content": "The world’s five largest listed oil companies are expected to reward their investors with record payouts of more than $100bn (£79bn) for 2023 against a backdrop of growing public outrage at fossil fuel profits. The five “super-majors” – BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies – showered shareholders with dividend payments and share buybacks worth $104bn in the 2022 calendar year, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The bumper payouts followed a year of record profits for big oil and gas companies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended global energy markets, triggering a rise in the international price of Brent crude and record gas prices across Europe. Financial analysts at IEEFA said the companies were likely to pay even greater shareholder distributions this year despite weaker commodity market prices leading to lower profits. The payouts will also follow a year that is expected to have been hotter than any other on record, with the climate emergency leading to a series of extreme weather events. Trey Cowan, an analyst at the IEEFA, said: “At the current pace of distributions via share buybacks and dividends, these five super-majors could set a record for distributions to shareholders in 2023, topping the $104bn spent during the 2022 calendar year.”  Interactive  Shell angered climate campaigners in November by setting out plans to pay shareholders at least $23bn in rewards this year, despite falling profits. The sum is more than six times the amount Shell planned to spend on renewable energy last year. Shell’s investor windfall follows one of the biggest annual profits in UK corporate history for 2022 when the oil company revealed profits of $40bn but weaker commodity market prices in 2023 mean its full-year earnings are expected to be lower. BP used its second-quarter results last year to tell shareholders to expect a 10% dividend raise in 2023, well above its initial guidance. The company had promised to raise the dividend by 4% each year and buy back about $4bn of shares, assuming the oil price was about $60 a barrel, but over the previous four quarters BP had repurchased $10bn of shares and increased its dividend by 20%. The handouts were particularly surprising after the company reported a deeper-than-expected profit slump. They were welcomed by investors, amid concern among some about the plans of the former chief executive Bernard Looney to “reimagine” BP as a net zero energy company by 2050. Oil companies continue to offer generous shareholder handouts as investors face growing pressure to divest their shares. Protests targeting oil company AGMs and conferences have become increasingly disruptive in recent years as campaigners demand more ambitious climate action. They have also faced hostility from campaign groups that have accused the companies of profiting from Russia’s war while millions of households have been plunged into a cost of living crisis driven by high energy costs. Alice Harrison, a campaigner at Global Witness, said: “The global energy crisis has been a giant cash grab for fossil fuel firms. And instead of investing their record profits in clean energy, these companies are doubling down on oil, gas and shareholder payouts. “Yet again millions of families won’t be able to afford to heat their homes this winter, and countries around the world will continue to suffer the extreme weather events of climate collapse. This is the fossil fuel economy, and it’s rigged in favour of the rich.” Some green groups believe lucrative shareholder rewards are being used to distract investors from the public backlash against the oil industry, and a terminal shift in government policies away from fossil fuels. But Dieter Helm, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford and a former government adviser, believes the payouts suggest the industry remains confident about its future profitability. Helm used his 2017 book Burnout: the Endgame for Fossil Fuels to set out how the oil industry might respond to the existential threat of climate action. In a “harvest and exit” strategy companies would probably wring out as much value for their shareholders as possible, while winding down their future fossil fuel spending, he suggested. But the climate agenda is unlikely to be playing a role in recent record shareholder paydays, he said. “For this to be the case you would have to believe that the energy transition is happening, and that demand for fossil fuels is going to fall. These companies are investing a huge amount in new projects, and they’re handing out bigger dividends because they are confident that they’re going to make big returns. And when we look at the state of our current climate progress, who’s to say they’re wrong?” The oil industry’s record investor payouts have been largely buoyed by a sharp increase in share buybacks, according to analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence (SPMI), which plays some role in future-proofing oil company payouts. Share buybacks allow companies to share a surge in profits with investors without the long-term commitment of a change to the dividend policy. They also help to reduce the number of shares in the market, which would make future dividend policies “cheaper” to fulfil. “In the US, Chevron leads a $75bn repurchase programme, followed by ExxonMobil’s $50bn. In Europe, Eni and Equinor have massively increased buybacks, up to 20% of cashflows from operations, albeit dividends remained as their priority. We forecast Shell and BP to allocate 15-18% of cashflow to dividends and about 25% to buybacks in 2024,” SPMI said. The analysts expect the oil and gas industry to relinquish its position as the sector that pays the biggest dividends in 2024, dropping to second place behind banks. The IEEFA’s Cowan says: “The [oil industry] is beginning to empty its war chest used to pay shareholders faster than they can replenish it. Future distributions to shareholders of these companies appear likely to fall and not continue to ascend.”"

Retail representatives across the rest of the UK are calling for similar protection as the most recent figures compiled for the Guardian by Police Scotland reveal the shocking rates of assaults and threatening or abusive behaviour against retail workers since the legislation came into force in August 2021. Figures from 2023 running up to the end of November showed that there were 2,233 reported assaults, an average of 203 each month and an increase of 50% from the previous year. Likewise, there were 2,582 reports of threatening or abusive behaviour in the same period until November 2023 – an average of 235 every month – another 50% rise. The Protection of Workers Act, which was brought before Holyrood as a member’s bill by Daniel Johnson, of Scottish Labour, created a new statutory offence of assaulting, threatening or abusing a retail worker and was backed unanimously by MSPs. “During the pandemic we became acutely aware of our dependence on retail workers,” explains Johnson. “That was a real driver for this law, along with the tendency for government to ask them to uphold public policy at the till point, whether that’s plastic bag changes or age restrictions on products.” He added: “No one should face violence at work, yet we’ve seen a further escalation of that around shop theft with the cost of living crisis creating a perfect storm. Retail workers tell me their day-to-day reality means routinely wearing body-worn cameras and fearing violence and aggression, whether its people hurling abuse if asked for proof of age or throwing punches when challenged about shop lifting.” Many want to see similar legislation brought in by the Westminster parliament to cover other areas of the UK. The Scottish figures show that a standalone offence “is clearly working”, according to the British Retail Consortium. Their latest crime survey, carried out last spring, which tallies self-reports from the whole of the UK, found 850 incidents of violence and abuse every day. In 2022, the consortium successfully campaigned for an amendment to Westminster’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which recommended that violence towards retail workers should be sentenced with an aggravating factor. But there is some frustration that no data is being collected on the use of this aggravation, though a UK government spokesperson said it was “confident that judges are taking [it] into consideration for relevant cases”. Retailers are playing their part, spending hundreds of millions on security staff, CCTV, security tags, and other anti-crime measures, says Graham Wynn, the assistant director of regulatory affairs at the consortium. A separate offence would mean a tougher sentence, better deterrence and result in police recording data around such incidents, “giving them a better idea of the scale of the problem, so they can best tackle it”. The shopworkers’ union Usdaw is also calling for a standalone offence, arguing that the epidemic of shoplifting has become a “a major flashpoint for violence and abuse against shopworkers”. Paddy Lillis, the union’s general secretary, said: “It is shocking that two-thirds of our members working in retail are suffering abuse from customers, with far too many experiencing threats and violence. Six in ten of these incidents were triggered by theft from shops. “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime … Having to deal with repeated and persistent shoplifters can cause issues beyond the theft itself like anxiety, fear and in some cases physical harm to retail workers. We are saying loud and clear that enough is enough, this should never be part of the job.”"
