        "content": "Cometh the hour … At times like these, we can only turn to one person. The woman with her finger on the dark heart of the Tory party. The woman who managed to expose a secret even MI6 didn’t realise it had. Even though it was MI6 who told her. Step forward, Nadine Dorries. Her seminal work of fiction, The Plot: the Political Assassination of Boris Johnson, uncovered a new history of the last 25 years. Nothing had been quite as it seemed. Here’s where her fearless research took her. Back in 1997, William Hague and Michael Gove had conspired to divert the Tory party from its true nature as the home of the deranged. So they had deliberately failed to make the party electable to allow David Cameron and George Osborne to take over. They in turn had plotted to lose the 2015 general election that they had won and to keep the UK in the EU by calling a referendum that they had lost. They knew Theresa May would be hopeless and that Boris Johnson, the One True King, would then take over. Though somehow it was their fault that Boris was a serial liar and morally corrupt and would be kicked out by the Tories and replaced by Liz Truss. Liz would be gone in seconds, Mad Nad predicted after the event, and then Sunak would be drafted in to lead the Tories to failure. After losing the election, Michael Gove would end his Arthurian quest by finally becoming Tory leader and taking the UK back into the EU. Even though he had campaigned for Brexit and was now out of government. It all made total sense. There was yet more. For if it wasn’t the Govester, then it would be She Who Could Not Be Denied: Kemi Badenoch. Who would have been about 10 when the Plot was first conceived. Truly she was blessed. The Lord moveth in mysterious ways. It does not fall upon us mere mortals to challenge his plan.   Related: Simon Clarke advised to lie down by Tory MP after calling for Sunak to quit   But it turns out the Plot keeps moving, the Conspirators more dangerous and elusive than Moriarty. Nad alone can keep up. So when Simon Clarke broke cover on Tuesday night to declare in the Daily Telegraph that what the country needed was yet another Tory party leadership contest months before the general election, Dorries was first to respond. “IT’S STARTED,” she tweeted excitedly. And possibly drunkenly. You could sense the excitement. The game was afoot. The shapeshifting Tory party had transformed itself yet again. It was Clarke. Of course it was. Who was better suited to champion the fortunes of the Tories than a complete nonentity? Someone who owed his brief stay in the cabinet to Johnson, that impeccable judge of character? An appointment probably just made on a whim. As a joke. Much like making him a knight. For services to not very much. The thing you have to know about Clarke is that he has been proved to be wrong about almost everything. Though weirdly, his reasons for wanting rid of Rishi were spot on. Though they could hardly fail to be. You don’t need a YouGov poll to tell you that the Tories are on course for annihilation under Sunak. Everyone knows it – none better than the Tory MPs themselves. Many know they will be looking for new jobs before the end of the year. Yet a Prophet is not without honour, save in his own land. Because the Conservatives have worked out they are in a lose-lose situation. If they stick with Rishi, they are done for. And if they ditch him now, they are also done for. The last thing the country can stomach is yet more infighting from the Tories. It would be nice for them to get round to some governing. Actually, scrub that. Let’s stick to the real world. So no sooner had Simple Simon raised his head above the parapet than dozens of Tories, who would like nothing more than to see the back of Sunak, declared their undying support for the prime minister. Something Clarke himself had done less than 12 months previously. What goes around. Suddenly we were expected to believe the Tories all spoke with one voice. This despite there being five warring factions on the right and a spineless group of halfwits on the left. With another new group – spearheaded by Liz Truss and Clarke – incoming in early February. Fantasy is what keeps Tory morale going. Conservative MPs again look to an imaginary poll in the Telegraph – there’s a theme developing here – which tells them if there was a mythical new leader from the Marvel franchise who could expel all foreigners, create peace throughout the world and make us richer beyond our dreams, then the Tories would win the next election. So they live in an hallucinatory world. Pipers at the gates of dawn. Their magical realism prime minister’s questions. Back to the real world. There was no sign of Simple Simon in the Commons for PMQs. Though there were several anonymous grey men in grey suits busy reassuring colleagues they weren’t Clarke. When Sunak finally showed up, the response was borderline hysteria. Nothing could have been more damning. The less respect they have for Sunak, the more vocal their support becomes. They aren’t even fooling themselves. Clarke is just a guilty window to their souls. Something Keir Starmer was at pains to point out: if even his colleagues didn’t want him, why should the country have to put up with him? It had become this existential. Literally, what was the point of Sunak? He didn’t even succeed as third-rate performance art. Nothing really works any more. Just saying there’s a plan when there clearly isn’t is an insult to people’s intelligence. We have to live in the world that the Tories have created. Sunak is rich enough to be immune to his own damage. This was no more than what Clarke had said and Sunak really had no answer. Instead, he tried to make it personal, starting another culture war by accusing Starmer of being a member of the wokerati. A National Trust lover. Probably listens to Radio 4. Is nice to black people. The Labour leader merely yawned. He had been director of public prosecutions in 2008. Sunak had just been making money out of other people’s misery. Then inflicting austerity on them. Read my lips, he said. Nothing worked. They couldn’t even get their childcare scheme off the ground. Long before the end, you could feel the energy being sucked out of the Tory benches. The truth inescapable: Sunak was just dead weight. Imagine. Worse even than Cameron, May, Johnson and Truss. Yet they were stuck with him. Simple Simon had merely been a Chronicle of a Death Foretold. “Six-nil, prime minister,” shouted one toadying backbencher as Sunak left. He was right. Starmer had won six-nil. But what to do? Stick or twist? Hell, go for it. You may as well keep us entertained this year. And don’t worry about Clarke. There’s time for at least three more leadership contests before the election."

At PMQs Keir Starmer taunted Sunak over Clarke’s comments, telling the house:\n\n\nThe prime minister spouts so much nonsense, no wonder they are giving up on him. Even now, as his government crumble around him and his own MPs point out that he is out of touch and has no plan for growth, crime or building houses, the prime minister is sticking to his one-man Pollyanna show – everything is fine; people should be grateful for him! The trouble is that no one is buying it. Does he actually understand why his own MPs say that he does not understand Britain, and that he is an “obstacle to recovery”.\n\n\nCouncils in England are to be handed an extra £500m in funding amid a worsening financial crisis at town halls across the country.\n\n\nRoyal Mail could save up to £650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and £200m by stopping Saturday deliveries, the communications regulator has said in its much-anticipated review of the postal service.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.34pm GMT\n\n\n 5.09pm GMT \nLaw Society criticises government for not scheduling Commons debate on UK-Rwanda treaty\n\nTom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, has indicated in a Commons written answer that the government is not planning to let MPs have a debate and vote on the government’s treaty with Rwanda. He said the Rwanda policy had already been scrutinised by MPs in the debates on the Rwanda bill.\nThe Law Society of England and Wales has criticised this decision. Its vice-president, Richard Atkinson, said:\n\nIt is extremely disappointing that the government won’t make time for the House of Commons to debate the Rwanda treaty, despite the House of Lords vote in favour of delaying ratification.\nGiven the supreme court found serious risks in the government’s Rwanda plan, this treaty ought to be scrutinised carefully to ensure the risks identified are fully addressed.\nMPs’ calls for a proper debate on the treaty are being ignored. It’s crucial to debate the substance of the treaty because any shortcomings will fatally undermine the safety of Rwanda bill and the government’s wider asylum policy.\n\nEarlier this month the home affairs committee said in a report there should be a Commons debate on the UK-Rwanda treaty.\n\nUpdated at 5.35pm GMT\n\n\n 4.51pm GMT \n\nThe Scottish government has refused to respond directly to demands from Labour for confirmation that it has handed all Nicola Sturgeon’s private emails about the Covid crisis to the UK inquiry. (See 2.02pm.) In response, it said:\n\nThe Scottish government is committed to responding to both the UK and Scottish Covid-19 inquiries, as learning lessons from the pandemic is vital to prepare for the future.\nIt would be inappropriate to comment on any matters being considered by the UK Covid Inquiry while hearings are ongoing.\nThe permanent secretary will reply to the letter [from Labour] in due course.\n\n\n\n\n 4.48pm GMT \nLabour MP Tahir Ali apologises for using disrespectful language when critising Sunak's pro-Israel stance\n\nThe Labour MP Tahir Ali has apologised for claiming that Rishi Sunak has “the blood of thousands of people on his hands” over his support for Israel. (See 12.38pm.)\nColleagues sitting behind Ali, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green, could be seen shaking their heads during prime minister’s questions as he levelled the accusation against Sunak, who promptly replied: “That is the face of the changed Labour party.”\nAli later issued two statements on X, formerly Twitter, saying:\n\n\n(1/2) Earlier at PMQs I asked the Prime Minister about the actions of Israel in Gaza.This is obviously a deeply emotive issue. While I do not resile from my strongly held views on the situation in the Middle East I would like to apologise for the way in which I described— Tahir Ali MP (@TahirAliMP) January 24, 2024\n\n\n\nEarlier at PMQs I asked the Prime Minister about the actions of Israel in Gaza. This is obviously a deeply emotive issue. While I do not resile from my strongly held views on the situation in the Middle East I would like to apologise for the way in which I described\n\n\n2/2) the Prime Minister in my question. We all have a responsibility to be respectful in the language that we use, even when discussing difficult and, at times, sensitive issues.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.50pm GMT\n\n\n 4.34pm GMT \nPoorest nations suffering most from Houthi attacks on shipping in Red Sea, Grant Shapps tells MPs\n\nThe Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are affecting the poorest nations the most, Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, has claimed.\nOpening a general Commons debate on the attacks, which have led to the UK twice participating in US-led airstrikes against the Houthis, Shapps said:\n\nSome 12% of international trade passes through the Red Sea every single year … amounting to more than $1tn worth of goods. In addition 8% of global grain trade, 12% of seaborne-traded oil, and 8% of the world’s liquefied natural gas all passes through this ancient seaway.\nPerhaps even more astonishing is that 40% of the goods that are traded between Europe and Asia go through the Red Sea as well. Sadly, the Houthis’ unlawful and callous attacks are putting all of that trade at risk …\nWhat these Iran-backed Houthi pirate thugs forget is that it is the least well-off nations and people who suffer the most from their illegal actions, starting with Yemen itself, where almost all of their food comes to it by sea.\nSo at times like this, these nations need to be stood up to, and nations must stand up to them. Attacks on Red Sea shipping automatically make this a global problem.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm GMT\n\n\n 4.05pm GMT \nUK government says it is considering limiting what civil servants in Scotland can do on Westminster reserved matters\n\nThe Scottish and UK governments are heading for a fresh battle over contentious Scottish policies such as independence after ministers in London confirmed they plan to release new rules to civil servants on reserved powers.\nThe Labour peer George Foulkes has waged a long-running campaign to bar ministers in Edinburgh from spending public money on a second independence referendum, and on Scotland’s network of “pretend embassies” overseas, claiming those are reserved matters.\nThe UK government today told a Lords constitution committee, in a response to a report on civil service appointments:\n\nThe government recognises the strength of the argument that further guidance to tighten up best practice is required and is in the process of considering how such guidance would support civil servants working in the devolved administrations on areas that may relate to reserved matters, and help ensure the civil service code is always maintained.\n\nThis confirms earlier pledges to do so, but Foulkes said:\n\nThe SNP project has deliberately gnawed away at the boundary between devolved and reserved matters, and this report serves as a very timely reminder that utilising civil servants to support efforts to break up the UK does not fall under devolved competencies.\nHowever, words must now be turned into actions. One rogue administration cannot be allowed to stain the integrity of our civil service, with their petty identity politics.\n\nThis raises tricky issues around constitutional proprieties. The SNP has won four successive Holyrood elections on a manifesto proposing independence. Previous Labour and Lib Dem administrations in Edinburgh funded overseas missions to promote inward investment. Would restrictions here be a precedent barring spending on other election pledges?\nFoulkes and other critics argue the UK supreme court ruling in 2022 that Nicola Sturgeon could not hold a second referendum without Westminster’s approval makes it ultra vires to spend public money on issues reserved to Westminster. But so far, no Scottish spending has gone on setting up an unlawful referendum.\nThe Scottish government said it had “a clear mandate to provide the people of Scotland with the information they need to make an informed choice about their future”. It added: “It is the role of the civil service to support the elected government of the day in developing and implementing its policies.”\n\nUpdated at 4.53pm GMT\n\n\n 3.27pm GMT \n\nReferring to the extract from the Commons order paper published earlier (see 11.56am), a reader asks:\n\nOn the list of people due to ask questions why do some get a ‘Mr’ or ‘Mrs’ and others do not?\n\nAnd here is the answer from a Commons official.\n\nMembers are able to choose the title applied to their preferred form of name, which is displayed on the members’ biography pages of the website and in other procedural systems in parliament. Shortly after a member joins the house, a member will be contacted by the house administration where they can request their preferred form of name, which is then added to their biographical record. Preferred forms of name can be changed over time based on the members’ preference.\n\n\n\n\n 3.21pm GMT \nNo 10 says conscription not being considered after army chief says war against Russia would be 'whole-of-nation undertaking'\n\nThe people of the UK are part of a “prewar generation” who must be prepared to fight a major war against Vladimir Putin’s increasingly aggressive Russia if necessary, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the army, argued in a speech.\nBut, as Dan Sabbagh reports in his story, the Ministry of Defence insisted that Sanders was not proposing peacetime conscription.\n\n Related: Army chief says people of UK are ‘prewar generation’ who must be ready to fight Russia \n\nDowning Street and the Labour party both insisted they would not back conscription. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson, when asked if Sunak would rule out conscription, replied:\n\nThere is no suggestion of that. The government has no intention to follow through with that.\nThe British military has a proud tradition of being a voluntary force. There are no plans to change that.\n\nAnd Keir Starmer’s spokesperson told journalists that conscription was not Labour policy.\n\n\n\n 3.00pm GMT \nDUP have negotiated 'very good deal' over changes to Windsor framework, Tory MP tells Commons\n\nMPs are currently debating the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill, which gives more time for a power-sharing executive to be formed before elections legally have to be held because no executive is in place. It sets 8 February as the new deadline and yesterday Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, suggested that he hoped that by then the government would have successfully persuaded the DUP to lift its boycott of power sharing.\nThe DUP has been refusing to sit in the executive as a protest against the post-Brexit trading rules set out in the Northern Ireland protocol, and its revised version, the Windsor framework. In the debate Julian Smith, a former Tory Northern Ireland secretary, said he thought the DUP had negotiated a good deal. He said:\n\n[Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader] and his team, I understand, seem to have negotiated also a very good deal with the government on issues around the Windsor framework and I hope in the coming days and weeks we will be able to see the results of that work.\nI am sure some within his party will still have concerns this will not be perfect, but much better now, having moved forward and done so much work over the last few months, to go back into the executive and to make the further arguments from there.\n\nSky’s Sam Coates says the DUP may have secured the removal of checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nLots of speculation about what the DUP might have been offered to them to get them back to Stormont.\nI’m told there it included a change to the law to “direct” the end of any checks on goods moving lawfully GB to NI and an Independent Monitoring Panel\nSince’s it’s a “domestic” matter, the UK were going to +inform+ not negotiate with the EU.\n\n\n\nLots of speculation about what the DUP might have been offered to them to get them back to Stormont.

The only thing Keir Starmer has changed is his own position on everything he says. pic.twitter.com/536LJYIG1g— Conservatives (@Conservatives) January 24, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.25pm GMT\n\n\n 2.15pm GMT \nLabour criticises government over figures showing cuts in police numbers\n\nThe government has cut the number of police officers serving in the unit responsible for smashing Channel smuggling gangs, according to figures released today.Police workforce statistics published by the Home Office show that there has been a cut of 343 National Crime Agency officers, as well as cuts of 311 police officers, 611 PCSOs [police community support officers] and 511 special constables between March and September 2023.Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said:\n\nOn a day of more Tory infighting, these are bombshell statistics that show the Conservatives cannot be trusted to keep our streets or our borders safe.\nNot content with cutting bobbies on the beat from our local communities, they are now cutting NCA officers too – the law enforcement body responsible for smashing the smuggling gangs operating in the Channel.\n\nRachel Harrison, national secretary of the GMB which represents PCSOs, said:\n\nPCSO numbers are being cut to the bone and the number of police staff remains well below 2010 levels. There are shortfalls across staff groups – from 999 call handlers to scene of crime investigators.These cuts are making our communities unsafe – it’s time for the government to invest in police staff.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.28pm GMT\n\n\n 2.02pm GMT \nOpposition parties demand disclosure of any Covid emails sent by Sturgeon from private SNP account\n\nOpposition parties have demanded the full disclosure of any emails sent or received by Nicola Sturgeon using her Scottish National party address for government business, in what was allegedly “a clear and deliberate breach of protocol”.\nThe controversy erupted after the UK Covid inquiry released evidence from Prof Devi Sridhar, the Edinburgh University health expert who advised Sturgeon during the pandemic, that Sturgeon offered her “private” SNP email address, as well as her government address, with the words: “Don’t worry about protocol – tackling the virus more important than that.”\nThat disclosure has fuelled allegations that Sturgeon, who is due to give evidence to the inquiry in Edinburgh next week, routinely used her SNP account for sensitive government business to evade official scrutiny and sidestep freedom of information laws, as did her special advisers.\nThe inquiry is already investigating mounting evidence that her most senior officials deleted their WhatsApp messages to avoid FoI disclosures, and acknowledged doing so.\nJackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, has written to John-Paul Marks, the permanent secretary at the Scottish government, calling for him to establish whether his officials had got hold of relevant SNP emails and handed them to the inquiry.\nBaillie said using a party address in that way was “a clear and deliberate breach of protocol”. She went on:\n\nThis action means that important information regarding the pandemic may not be accessible to the public.\nIndeed I have been told by former cabinet ministers that the use of SNP emails was widespread. I would therefore be grateful to know what information sent to SNP email accounts has been recovered by the Scottish government for the inquiry.\n\nSeparately, Craig Hoy, the Scottish Conservative chair, wrote to Sturgeon calling on her to “do the right thing” and release the material voluntarily.\nThe Scottish government and SNP have been asked for their responses.\n\nUpdated at 2.08pm GMT\n\n\n 1.55pm GMT \n\nAt the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s press secretary also said that Rishi Sunak would not be distracted by Simon Clarke’s call for a new party leader. Asked about the Clarke article in the Telegraph, she said:\n\nThis is one MP. We recognise that he’s in a different place to some other MPs that have come out today. He’s entitled to his view but that won’t distract us from getting on with what matters to people.\n\n\n\n\n 1.48pm GMT \nNo 10 hints Sunak open to reappointing Lee Anderson as Tory deputy chair despite rebellion over Rwanda bill\n\nNo 10 has hinted that Rishi Sunak is open to reappointing Lee Anderson as one of the Conservative party’s deputy chairs.\nAnderson, a working-class rightwinger, resigned from his post two weeks ago because he wanted to defy the party whip and vote for “rebel” amendments to strengthen the Rwanda bill. \nBut he and Brendan Clarke-Smith, who also resigned as a Tory deputy chair for the same reasons, issued a remarkably conciliatory resignation letter, stating their “100% support” for Sunak.\nAnderson has now told the Daily Telegraph that he should have voted for the Rwanda bill at third reading, instead of abstaining, and that he would like his Tory deputy chair job back.\nAt the post-PMQs lobby briefing, asked if Sunak would reappoint him, the PM’s press secretary said it was “the PM’s prerogative to choose and when” who gets which jobs. She went on:\n\nI think we can say that we have a lot of time for Lee. He made it clear that he had concerns but actually he really supports getting this deterrent up and running so it’s good to see him talking about that today.\n\n\n\n\n 1.26pm GMT \nPMQs - snap verdict\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThat PMQs, or at least the Sunak/Starmer section, was even more cantankerous and unilluminating than usual. There were moments when genuine contempt, as opposed to professional, political hostility, seemed to be showing through. For anyone who aspires to a more uplifting politics, bad news: there may be 10 more months of this.\nBut there are always some takeaways to excavate, and the first is one that might count as good news for Sunak; no Tory stood up to support Simon Clarke. Judging by comments on airwaves, on social media and in private WhatsApp groups, the Clarke attempted coup (if that is what it even was) had fizzled out before PMQs even started (at least for now). Sunak did not come under attack from his own MPs, as Theresa May and Boris Johnson did at PMQs when they were near the departure door. So, for Sunak, it could have been worse.\nStarmer, of course, raised the Clarke article. Two weeks ago, after Starmer claimed at PMQs that Sunak was someone who “simply doesn’t get Britain”, some rightwingers, including the former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, accused Starmer of a dog whistle racist slur. The allegation never gained much traction, but now we definitely won’t be hearing it again because what Starmer said was repeated, almost word for word, by Clarke in his Telegraph article today. He wrote:\n\nRishi has great strengths. He is decent to his core, fiercely intelligent and works formidably hard.\nI saw these strengths up close whilst chief secretary to the Treasury when he was chancellor.\nBut these strengths cannot compensate for two fundamental problems. He does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.\n\nStarmer must have been aware of this as he quoted Clarke in his opening question.\n\nThe prime minister has had quite a week. From endlessly fighting with his own MPs to collapsing in laughter when he was asked by a member of the public about NHS waiting lists … The only thing missing from that punishing schedule is any sort of governing or leadership. So was he surprised to see one of his own MPs say that he doesn’t get what Britain needs and he’s not listening to what people want?\n\nStarmer is getting better and better at using ridicule as a weapon against Sunak, and today was another polished performance. “One-man Pollyanna show” was a particularly good line (although only to those who get the reference). It was interesting to hear Starmer attack Sunak over his career as a hedge fund investor before he became MP, saying he made millions “betting on the misery of working people”, but this line may not work effectively because most people don’t know very much about what Sunak was doing in his pre-Commons career, or what hedge funds actually do anyway.\nStarmer only properly got on to a policy issue with his fourth question, where he asked about Monday’s Times report saying “thousands of parents have been warned they will be unable to access the government’s flagship free-childcare offer this year because of issues with the rollout”. He linked this to the “out of touch” critique by arguing that Sunak did not really appreciate the impact this might have on working people, but after so much broad-brush knockabout at the start, these questions did not have as much impact as they might have done if he had asked them straight. However, he did somehow get the speaker to let him get away with calling the government’s record a “shitshow” (presumably because he was quoting the Times).\nFrom Sunak, we got almost the entire repertoire of the CCHQ anti-Starmer story, starting with a retro culture wars broadside.\n\n[Starmer] talks about what Britain needs, what Britain wants, what Britain values. This from a man who takes the knee, who wanted to abolish the monarchy, who still doesn’t know what a woman is, and who just this week, one of his frontbenchers, said that they backed teaching divisive white privilege in our schools. Looking at his record, it’s crystal clear which one of us doesn’t get Britain’s values.\n\nNo doubt there are some voters who buy this stuff, but mostly it sounds a bit desperate. Sunak was stronger ground when he attacked Starmer over the £28bn green jobs pledge, which the Tories are depicting as a tax commitment. Starmer has insisted that he won’t put up taxes to fund it, but Labour has also said it won’t break its borrowing fiscal rules to fund it either, and there are probably quite a few takers for Sunak’s sceptical take.\n\nWe do know that he is committed to his 2030 decarbonisation promise, which they say will cost £28bn but I was reading about it this week. He says he has changed the party, one of his team called it an albatross hanging around their neck, that might have been the shadow chancellor maybe, but he said they are doubling down on it.\nAll this ahead of a crunch meeting we are told this week for them to work out how they are going to pay for it. I can save them some time because we all know the answer, higher taxes for the British people.\n\nSunak is almost certainly not a great Guardian reader, but he was quoting our story from last week. It remains to be seen whether Labour feels confident about its ability to refute 10 more months of this, or whether there is going to be a policy clarification.\n\nUpdated at 2.24pm GMT\n\n\n 12.38pm GMT \nLabour MP Tahir Ali claims Sunak has 'blood of thousands on his hands' because of his support for Israel\n\nTahir Ali (Lab) says the government has said Israel respects international law while internal government documents show Foreign Office officials do not believe this. He says this means the PM has the blood of innocent people on his hands.\nSunak says Ali’s comment suggests Labour has not really changed, despite Starmer’s claims.\nUPDATE: Ali said:\n\nRecently released documents reveal that the Foreign Office had serious concerns about Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law and its ongoing assault on Gaza.\nThis assessment was hidden from parliament whilst the prime minister boldly stated his confidence in Israel’s respect for international law.\nSince then, the scale of Israel’s war crimes in Gaza have been revealed to the world thanks to South Africa’s case to the ICJ.\nTherefore, is it now not the time for the prime minister to admit that he has the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands and for him to commit to demanding an immediate ceasefire and an ending of UK’s arms trade with Israel?\n\nAnd Sunak replied:\n\nThat’s the face of the changed Labour party.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.36pm GMT\n\n\n 12.35pm GMT \n\nMiriam Cates (Con) asks about the report of a 14-year-old girl who took her life following bullying on social media.

He says:\n\n\nLet us fast forward to, say, 15 November and a heavy Conservative defeat. The first instinct of any party in these circumstances is to attribute blame. Where to start? Boris Johnson and Partygate? No, it cannot be that – at least not in the eyes of Johnson loyalists such as Clarke. What about Liz Truss and the mini-budget? Certainly not, says Sir Simon, the Truss enthusiast. He might, just as he did in his Telegraph article, graciously acknowledge that Sunak is “far from solely responsible for our present predicament” (a phrase that is doing an awful lot of work) but, yes, it was really all Sunak’s fault. He was unclear, beholden to convention, soft on immigration, too accepting of international law, and lacking in the vision to deliver tax, welfare, planning and public services reform. Damn it, man. He is just not Conservative enough …\nClarke cannot seriously believe he is going to win the argument that now is the time for another change of leader. But, at the very least, he is laying down a marker for the argument to come about who takes responsibility for an election defeat and how the Conservative party changes as a consequence. At that point, he might be very confident that his view may well prevail. Scapegoating Sunak is what this is really all about.\n\n\nIsabel Hardman at the Spectator says some other Tory MPs are expected to follow Simon Clarke in calling for Rishi Sunak to go. She says:\n\n\nFor all the whips’ efforts, there are other Conservative MPs who are planning to join Clarke, hence his line in his piece about ‘every Conservative MP will need to live with the decision they make in the coming days for the rest of their lives’. It’s not clear how many MPs this will be, though a handful have told colleagues that they are preparing to do so. As Katy Balls says, the intervention has so far served to solidify Sunak’s position within the party, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t continue to be storm damage from unhappy MPs. That said, the party has been so manifestly split and ill-disciplined for so long that it probably won’t make much difference to the way voters view the Tories.\n\n\nAnd Katy Balls at the Spectator says, while the rebels do not have the numbers to topple Sunak, they are damaging the party. She says:\n\n\nAs I say in this week’s magazine, while regicide is in the air, most think the Tory rebels are nowhere near the numbers and instead are more likely to embark on a coup that fails and hurts the party in the meantime. ‘There are some serious Hoon/Hewitt-type morons around at the moment,’ says a recent departee of No 10.\nThe immediate problem for Sunak is that this just reinforces the idea that the Tory party is more serious about infighting than winning. As a minister puts it: ‘You have two irreconcilable groups: one who thinks the bad polls are down to psychodrama and infighting the other that thinks it’s down to Sunak and the government.’ The only comfort for Sunak right now is that as things stand the first group is much larger than the latter.\n\n\nStephen Bush in the Financial Times dismisses the polling quoted by the Telegraph, in its story about Clarke, suggesting a new Tory leader would be more popular than Keir Starmer. He says:\n\n\nWhile the polling shows Starmer beating Sunak on the question of which of the two men voters prefer for prime minister, the Labour leader falls behind in a head-to-head with an imagined “new Tory leader”. The survey did not present respondents with names of possible alternative Tory leaders, but asked who they would prefer: “Starmer or a hypothetical Conservative candidate who meets the following description: stronger on crime and migration, who cut taxes and got NHS waiting lists down.”\nI mean, really, why stop there? If you’re going to poll Starmer’s performance against a Conservative leader who improves public services, cuts taxes and lowers immigration, why not go the whole hog and ask how voters would act if Starmer faced a Conservative prime minister who cured cancer, resolved my long-running dispute with Wickes over my bathroom renovation, gave everyone in the UK a million pounds tax-free and scored the winning goal in the World Cup final? Of course Sunak does worse against Starmer than an imagined, perfect ideal of a Conservative prime minister.\n\n\nAnd Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome agrees, adding that there is no crisis for No 10 this morning. He says:\n\n\nA poll that compared Sunak’s performance against Sir Keir to, say, Kemi Badenoch’s, Penny Mordaunt’s and James Cleverly’s might tell us something worth knowing. This nugatory exercise does not.\nThe Telegraph somewhat downplays the poll, at least compared to its presentation last week. It isn’t pushed in headlines online, nor has similar space been cleared for it.\nThe paper offers its readers a nice selection of potential leadership runners and riders, kindly quoting this site’s survey, diminished only by the fact that three of them are presently ineligible.\nAll in all, there is no crisis for Downing Street this morning, but were more Tory MPs to follow Sir Simon’s lead in a purposeful way, and to interact with those gnomic donors, that could change.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.27pm GMT\n\n\n 11.34am GMT \n\nAnd Christopher Hope from GB News quotes a figure from the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee saying Simon Clarke’s attempt to defenestrate Rishi Sunak has flopped.\n\nLATEST on fall-out from Simon Clarke’s call for the PM to go.One 1922 figure tells me: “It seems to have fizzled already.

There has been no action since, only warnings from experts that the proposals are too weak by excluding weapons like ninja swords. \nThe government has published 16 press releases about zombie knives since 2015, yet despite repeated promises to toughen the rules, a full ban is still not in place …\nLabour is going further by also pledging a crackdown on the sale of dangerous knives online. Rambo knives, swords and machetes are all too easily available through sites such as Knife Warehouse. Recent high-profile murder cases, such as the killing of Ronan Kanda, have shown verification measures such as ID checks have been easily subverted.\nLabour has also long called for tough criminal sanctions on tech executives who allow knife sales on their online marketplaces, such as Amazon Marketplace, eBay and Instagram. This follows a Which investigation that identified repeated examples of knives for sale on these decentralised platforms, often listed by individual sellers abroad (e.g. the USA). In the Online Safety Act, the government simply opted for Ofcom fines for such breaches – but still hasn’t put that measure into force. \n\nAnd Starmer said:\n\nThe number of these deadly weapons on Britain’s streets is terrifying, and unacceptable. \nFor years, the Tories have made grand promises of action, but by failing to bring a proper ban on these killer knives and to crack down on online sales to kids, they’re letting a generation down …\nLabour will act. There will be nothing short of a ban by my Labour government. And we won’t stop there – we’ll crack down on online sales, too. No child should be able to buy a deadly weapon as easily as they can online today.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.15am GMT\n\n\n 11.00am GMT \n\nIn posts on X, Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, says that even though Tory MPs are not supporting Simon Clarke in public, in private the mood is febrile.\n\n\nWe reported ‘several’ no confidence letters in after Rwanda vote @SimonClarkeMP 2nd MP to publicly call for PM to go in order to ‘avoid election massacre’ He’s been rebuked by Fox, Patel, Davis.

In it, Franklin says he used to think it was too late for another leadership contest before the election but has changed his mind. Here’s an extract.\n\nTo insist that Sunak remains in place means assuming one of two things: firstly, that his basic political strategy is commensurate with the challenges facing us a party; or, secondly, that he can successfully execute a change of direction. If, in either respect, that is what you do believe then I’d love to see your evidence; but if you don’t, then what possible reason could there be for sticking with Sunak?\nWell, there is one justification. It rests upon the fatalistic assumption that it’s too late to avoid defeat: changing strategies won’t work, nor will changing leaders. We’re therefore better off having the next leadership contest — and a fundamental rethink — in opposition.\nUntil recently, that’s what I thought too. But then I remembered Lyndon B Johnson’s first rule of politics: “learn to count.” A leadership contest before the general election would be hurried, but at least there’d be 346 Conservative MPs (who haven’t been leader before) to choose from. But how long would this long-list be after the election? 200? 100? 50? As things stand, none of those numbers is out of the question, (though I’d admit that 200 is pushing the bounds of plausibility).\n\n\n\n\n 10.51am GMT \nHome Office U-turns on policy to restrict help for trafficking victims\n\nThe Home Office has performed a U-turn on a policy to deprive some modern slavery victims of protection from traffickers, Diane Taylor reports.\n\n Related: Home Office U-turns on policy to restrict help for trafficking victims \n\n\n\n\n 10.49am GMT \nDavid Cameron should face questions from MPs in Commons chamber, procedure committee recommends\n\nMinisters have been urged to back an obscure compromise so that David Cameron can be scrutinised in the House of Commons despite not being an MP, PA Media reports.\n\n Related: David Cameron could face questions from MPs using obscure compromise \n\nThe story is based on this report from the procedure committee which points out that, if Cameron were invited to take questions from MPs at the “bar” of the Commons (the thick line in the carpet, near the entrance, which marks the formal entrance to the chamber), he would be following in the footsteps of the Duke of Wellington. It says:\n\nUntil the first part of the 19th century, important inquiries were entrusted to committees of the whole house, with witnesses examined at the bar. Members of the Lords, while providing evidence, were given chairs within the bar but stood to answer questions. Indeed, there are several precedents for members of the Lords addressing the Commons directly from within the bar, as did Lord Melville in 1805, and the Duke of Wellington in 1814.\nNowadays, witnesses provide evidence to inquiries overseen by select committees. It has been more than 60 years since a non-member appeared at the bar of the house; the last instance was in 1957, when the journalist John Junor was admonished.\n\nThe government says it will consider the recommendation. But when Cameron, and No 10, have been asked about this issue, they have always insisted that Cameron is accountable anyway, because he takes questions from peers and from the Commons foreign affairs committee, and that Labour cabinet ministers in the Lords did not appear at the bar of the Commons chamber. It sounds like the recommendation will be shelved.\n\nUpdated at 10.57am GMT\n\n\n 10.32am GMT \nMinister rejects claim Clarke's article linked to a 'plot' to get rid of Sunak\n\nOn the Today programme this morning Nick Robinson asked Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, if he thought the Simon Clarke article was evidence of a “plot” to remove Rishi Sunak, or “an attempt of a coup”. Hollinrake gave a clear answer: “No, not at all.”\nClarke himself has denied acting on behalf of someone else with leadership ambitions. And sources close to Liz Truss have been telling journalists this morning that she did know that this article was coming, and does not support it. “God knows what he’s up to,” said one\nBut do we really believe that the article appeared out of the blue, and that Clarke just happened to ring up the Telegraph yesterday to offer his article unprompted? Here are five reasons to think that it is not that simple, and that some sort of plot is afoot.\n1) Clarke published his article only a week after expensive polling was published showing the Conservatives on course for a landslide defeat. YouGov says the polling was commissioned by Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister, and paid for by “the Conservative Britain Alliance”, a mysterious organisation apparently comprising party donors. No one has said who they are. We don’t know for sure why they put up the money (reportedly, a hefty five-figure sum), but it seems unlikely that they are disinterested psephologists.\n2) The Telegraph wrote up the poll findings in a way that supports the view that changing the party leader would make a difference. News organisations often present polling in a subjective manner, but this was quite an extreme example – prompting YouGov to disown the Telegraph’s interpretation. Not for the first time, the paper seems to be shaping Conservative politics, not just reporting it.\n3) Another tranche of polling has been published by the Telegraph today to back up Clarke’s argument. In its story on the Clarke article, the paper says:\n\nA YouGov poll of 13,000 voters suggests that a new Tory leader, championing core Conservative values, could secure a convincing victory over Labour.\nWhen people were asked who they would prefer as prime minister – Sir Keir or a new, tax-cutting Tory leader with a tougher approach to legal and illegal migration – voters in 322 constituencies in England and Wales preferred a new Tory leader, while Sir Keir came out on top in only 164 seats.\nIn 89 constituencies the most common answer was “not sure”. If the “not sure” respondents are stripped out, a new Tory is most popular in 375 constituencies to 200 …\nThe poll did not present respondents with names of possible alternative Tory leaders, but asked if they would prefer as prime minister: Sir Keir or a new Tory leader who was stronger on crime and migration, who cut taxes and got NHS waiting lists down.\n\nThis seems to be a finding from the YouGov MRP poll published last week. But why was it saved up for use alongside an article from an MP calling for a new leader, unless the paper was sure this was coming?\n4) The Clarke article includes a phrase that suggests it was written for publication after January. This point has been raised by Christopher Hope, the GB News political editor, who posted these on X.\n\nClarke references the MRP poll in his @Telegraph op-ed tonight: “In January, the Telegraph’s YouGov MRP poll showed that were an election to be held, the Conservatives would fall from our current 350 MPs to 169, just four more seats than Sir John held in 1997.”\n\n\nWhat is odd is that Clarke says “in January” in his @Telegraph article. Was this piece originally written with a view to it being published next month? Perhaps after a possible double by-election defeat on Feb 15th?\n\n5) Next month Clarke is due to join Liz Truss at the launch of a new group, Popular Conservatism, dedicated to restoring “democratic accountability to Britain” (code for getting rid of PMs who have not been elected by party members, or the electorate at large?) and delivering “popular conservative policies”. This does not sound like an effort to shore up Sunak.\n\n\nPopular Conservatism is launching in central London on Tuesday 6th February.If you’d like to join me, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, @SimonClarkeMP, @ranil and others, please visit https://t.co/pKpduKS8FQ to register. pic.twitter.com/1ghRVO9xCz— Liz Truss (@trussliz) January 22, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.26am GMT\n\n\n 9.50am GMT \nClarke says his call for Sunak to go 'emphatically' not motivated by leadership ambitions, his or anyone else's\n\nLast night Simon Clarke posted messages on X responding to the criticism he was getting from colleagues over his Telegraph article.

He needs to go home, have a lie down in a dark room and repeatedly say ‘I must take the fight to Labour’ until it finally sinks in.”\nA senior Tory official said of Clarke: “If he wants to help Sir Keir become the next PM he should just cross the floor.”\n\n\n Related: Rishi Sunak must quit before he leads Tories to extinction, says ex-minister \n\n\n\n\n 9.17am GMT \n‘This is getting silly’: senior Tories criticise Simon Clarke after he calls for Sunak’s resignation\n\nGood morning. Until last night, the only Conservative MP publicly calling for Rishi Sunak to resign was Dame Andrea Jenkyns, a Boris Johnson acolyte who spent three and a half months as a junior minister. Even lobby correspondents would draw the line at calling her a “senior Tory” and no one paid much attention. But last night Sir Simon Clarke, who has served in cabinet under two prime ministers and who is not widely viewed as a crank, joined in, publishing an article in the Daily Telegraph saying the Tories should ditch Sunak before the general election.\nPotentially, this takes the Conservative leadership crisis into new territory. Clarke is close to Liz Truss, the former PM, who is about to launch a new group called Popular Conservatism (sic), or PopCon. It does not seem committed to supporting Sunak’s leadership. Perhaps more importantly, Clarke seems to have the backing of an even more important player in Tory politics: the Daily Telegraph.\nBut … the early indications are that this could fail just as dismally as the Geoff Hoon/Patricia Hewitt “coup” against Gordon Brown in 2010. Clarke does not seem to have any Conservative MPs clambering out of the trenches behind him, and some proper senior Tories have lined up to attack him.\nPriti Patel, the former home secretary, has accused him of “facile and divisive self-indulgence”.\n\nAt this critical time for our country, with challenges at home and abroad, our party must focus on the people we serve and deliver for the country. Engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence only serves our opponents, it’s time to unite and get on with the job.\n\n\n\nAt this critical time for our country, with challenges at home and abroad, our party must focus on the people we serve and deliver for the country.

        "content": "Simon Clarke has been told it would be “good advice” to head to a dark room, lie down and sort himself out, after he called on Rishi Sunak to quit as Conservative leader or risk a Tory “massacre” at the general election. The postal affairs minister, Kevin Hollinrake, said Clarke’s intervention on Tuesday night was a sign of the “panic” that is brewing in some factions, but said it was not a view held by the wider parliamentary party. Clarke, a former cabinet minister, said in an op-ed for the Daily Telegraph that Sunak was “leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred”. He added: “He does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.” A number of senior Conservative MPs swiftly criticised his remarks, including the former home secretary Priti Patel, who said “engaging in facile and divisive self-indulgence only serves our opponents”. Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Of course, some people panic at a difficult time. This is not the overwhelming view of the party.” When asked if Clarke and other frustrated Tories should head to a dark room, lie down and sort themselves out, Hollinrake told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: “That’s good advice for Simon but the rest of us are getting on with the job. You’re talking about an isolated position taken by one member of parliament, you’re not talking about the overwhelming view of the parliamentary party.” In a message to “anyone else who shares his views, Hollinrake added: “Get your head down and get some work done, let’s turn this country around, which is what we’re doing. After the cabinet minister dismissed calls for Sunak to resign as “isolated”, another senior Conservative lashed out at Clarke for his remarks. Tobias Ellwood accused Clarke of “throwing his teddies in the corner” because “his choice of prime minister is no longer in No 10”. He labelled the intervention “dangerous, reckless, selfish” and “defeatist” and urged Clarke and his allies to realise that voters want “unity, unity, unity”. “I do urge him and others to think really carefully about what they are doing,” Ellwood said. A confidence vote in the prime minister will be triggered if 53 Tory MPs submit letters to the 1922 Committee. So far, Clarke and the former minister Dame Andrea Jenkyns are the only Conservative MPs to have publicly called for Sunak to go. The former defence minister Ben Wallace has also weighed into the row, criticising Clarke’s remarks in an article for the Telegraph, insisting “division and another PM would lead to the certain loss of power”. “My colleague Sir Simon Clarke is wrong,” Wallace wrote, “The way to win the next election is to tackle inflation and grow the economy. “Rishi is doing just that. Division and another PM would lead to the certain loss of power. We need to focus on delivering for the public not divisive rowing.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has warned there could be further bombing of Yemen if Houthi attacks on shipping continue, as he came under mounting pressure from MPs to clarify Britain’s long-term strategy for tackling the deepening crisis.\nThe prime minister told parliament that a second round of RAF airstrikes, conducted on Monday night with the US, were taken in self-defence and rejected calls for MPs to be allowed a vote on whether to endorse the military action.\nThe Houthis, who control the north and west of Yemen, said on Tuesday they would continue to fight on in support of Gaza, and told British and American aid workers to leave the part of the country they control within 30 days.\nSunak said the UK and the US “are not seeking a confrontation” with the Houthis, but complained that the group had conducted at least 12 attacks on western shipping since the first round of British and American airstrikes on 12 January.\nThat was sufficient to justify Monday night’s bombing raid, which saw RAF Typhoons strike two targets near Sana’a, the prime minister said, adding that the bombing of Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries, may continue.\n\n Related: US and UK strike Houthis in latest attempt to stop group targeting Red Sea ships \n\n“If necessary, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence,” said Sunak.\n“We cannot stand by and allow these attacks to go unchallenged. Inaction is also a choice,” he said, and went on to hint there could be additional efforts to halt the supply of weapons to the Houthis from Iran.\n“We must end the illegal flow of arms to the Houthi militia,” Sunak said, noting that the UK had “intercepted weapons shipments in the region before, including components of the very missiles used by the Houthis today”. Britain would work with “allies and partners” to try to disrupt and deter their supply in the future, he added.\nThe foreign secretary, David Cameron, will visit the Middle East “in the coming days”, the prime minister said, as part of a fresh effort to ease tensions. \nThe tour, which begins on Wednesday, will see him visit Qatar, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Turkey to press for an immediate temporary humanitarian pause in the fighting, saying the situation in Gaza is desperate.\nEarlier this month the US and UK became engaged in bombing the Houthis in an attempt to halt a string of missile, drone and small-boat attacks mounted by the rebel group against international shipping in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, through which an estimated 15% of world seaborne trade passes.\nExperts believe the airstrikes, aimed at launch sites, radar facilities and underground bomb storage, could go on for several weeks because Houthi targets are dispersed and hard to hit, partly because the rebel group has endured nine years of civil war, including a bombing campaign led by Saudi Arabia.\nSidharth Kaushal, a naval expert with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said: “We should expect a protracted crisis if the Houthis are not deterred from further action by the prospect of a protracted air campaign against them.”\nHouthi leaders remained defiant on Tuesday. The Houthi army spokesperson, Brig Gen Yahya Saree, said the allied attacks would not go unpunished or unanswered. Eighteen targets were struck overnight, he added, but no casualty figures were given.\nBritish and American aid workers were also asked to leave Yemen within 30 days, according to a letter sent to aid agencies by the Houthi-controlled foreign affairs ministry.\nAid workers already fear the series of airstrikes will dangerously weaken Yemen’s fragile humanitarian situation, in a country where imports of food and medicines have been in decline for several weeks.\nThe Houthis say their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which began in mid-October, are in support of Gaza. Propaganda put out by the group on social media juxtaposed pictures of Sana’a under attack with similar pictures in Gaza, or images of what appeared to be killed and wounded Palestinians.\nJeremy Quin, a former defence minister and the new Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, called on Sunak to acknowledge there might need to be “a prolonged, persistent, targeted campaign” in order to protect shipping in the Red Sea region.\nIn reply, the prime minister sought at first to downplay the prospect. “I want to be absolutely clear that no decision has been taken to embark on a sustained campaign of the nature that he mentioned,” Sunak said, before emphasising: “We do reserve the right to take action in self-defence.”\nLabour and Scottish National party MPs all pressed Sunak to set out the UK’s strategy for resolving the Red Sea crisis, calling for diplomatic efforts and humanitarian relief in addition to military action.\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, said his party would judge further action against the Houthis on a case-by-case basis and that it backed the current “targeted action to reinforce maritime security in the Red Sea”.\n\n Related: Houthis say US-UK airstrikes will not go unpunished or unanswered \n\nHowever, he also asked whether the military action would be effective, what efforts the UK was taking to build and enlarge support for a maritime coalition protecting merchant shipping, and what “concrete steps” were being taken “to help the people of Yemen who have suffered terribly as a result of that country’s civil war”.\nIn reply, Sunak said an initial analysis showed “all intended targets were destroyed” and, in a later answer, added that there was “no evidence to suggest” there were civilian casualties caused by the latest round of bombing – or from the previous round of British strikes earlier in the month.\nDebbie Abrahams, a backbench Labour MP, said she shared concerns about “what the strategy is, what the contagion to the rest of the Middle East will be and that we are potentially bolstering the Houthis’ position in Yemen”.\nEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, called for MPs to be given a vote on military action against the Houthis, arguing that “the huge cross-party support for limited strikes” would “surely strengthen the signal he intends to give” to the Yemeni rebels.\nSunak said MPs would be allowed a “general debate” in the Commons on Wednesday over the military intervention. But by convention such a debate is not followed by a vote.\nRecent parliamentary precedent has been to give MPs the right to approve military action, including the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the bombing of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2014 and 2015.\nHowever, formally the power is part of the royal prerogative reserved with the government, allowing for military action to be taken in self-defence without consulting parliament first.\nSummary legal advice released by the government sought to emphasise this point, and said that “dozens of serious attacks on shipping” by the Houthis had targeted “British flagged vessels, as well as the vessels of many other states”.\nThe rebel group’s campaign had “culminated in an attack against HMS Diamond, involving multiple drones” in the Red Sea on 9 January, therefore justifying the UK in joining the US in attacking Yemen, using force to prevent further attacks."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak should resign before he leads the Conservatives to “extinction”, a Tory MP has said in an excoriating attack on the prime minister. In a dramatic intervention on Tuesday night, Simon Clarke, who was a cabinet minister in Liz Truss’s short-lived government, urged Sunak to quit and make way for a new Tory leader. In an op-ed for the Telegraph, Clarke said Sunak’s “uninspiring leadership is the main obstacle to our recovery” and that he has “sadly gone from asset to anchor”. He argued that Sunak “is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred” because “he does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.” Clarke’s article set off a fresh round of internal party warfare. Tory grandees from all wings of the party hit back at Clarke on social media. Priti Patel, the former home secretary, said on X that “engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence only serves our opponents”. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said: “This is getting silly. The Party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK’s best interests.” Damian Green, chair of the One Nation caucus of centrist Tory MPs, said on the same platform that Clarke’s intervention was “wrong and unwise.” Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, warned that “those who have an agenda to destabilise the government in an election year should understand the consequences”. Speaking privately, other Tory MPs were even more forthright. “Not sure we should be taking top tips on leadership from Liz Truss’s right hand,” one minister told the Guardian. “What the bloody hell is Simon Clarke doing?” said a Tory MP who backed Truss in the 2022 leadership contest. Another Tory MP said: “Simon Clarke hasn’t helped himself, the party, his country or any of his colleagues tonight – only [Keir] Starmer. He needs to go home, have a lie down in a dark room and repeatedly say ‘I must take the fight to Labour’ until it finally sinks in.” A senior Tory official said of Clarke: “If he wants to help Sir Keir become the next PM he should just cross the floor.” In his piece Clarke conceded that “many MPs are afraid another change of leader would look ridiculous”, but added: “What could be more ridiculous than meekly sleepwalking towards an avoidable annihilation because we were not willing to listen to what the public are telling us so clearly?” Senior Tories believe Clarke’s intervention is part of a coordinated plot against Sunak by some on the Tory right, including peer David Frost.  Last week the Telegraph published a YouGov poll suggesting the Tories were headed for a crushing election defeat, accompanied by an op-ed from Frost arguing that their only hope was to take a harder line on immigration. A new Tory leader would be the fourth Conservative prime minister in 18 months. Boris Johnson departed in September 2022 and was briefly succeeded by Truss before Sunak took charge. Labour’s national campaign coordinator Pat McFadden said the Tories were forming “another circular firing squad”.  “There are many good reasons for getting rid of this clapped out Conservative government and liberating the British people from endless bouts of Tory infighting is certainly one of them,” he said. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was “utterly ludicrous that the Conservative party is even discussing installing a fourth prime minister without even giving voters a say”."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-23T19:19:36+00:00",
        "content": "Forecasts on the outlook for the public finances last year were beyond “a work of fiction”, the head of the Treasury’s independent forecasting unit has suggested, after the government failed to provide details of its spending plans. In an unusually scathing intervention, Richard Hughes, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), criticised the support he gets from the government to help him forecast public spending. Addressing the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords, he said the OBR’s forecasts were based on “questionable assumptions” that lead people to call his efforts a work of fiction. “Some people call [the projections] a work of fiction, but that is probably being generous when someone has bothered to write a work of fiction and the government hasn’t even bothered to write down what its departmental spending plans are underpinning the plans for public services,” he said. Hughes was disappointed last November when he was asked to provide a forecast to be published alongside Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement without being given any detail from the chancellor about Whitehall departmental budgets, apart from a headline figure that showed them falling over the five-year period. Hunt was expected to hold a comprehensive spending review (CSR) to show how departments might cut costs and reduce spending, but departments were told to base their spending assumptions on existing budgets. In 2022 Hughes famously provided Kwasi Kwarteng with a five-year forecast of the public finances even though the then chancellor had refused to ask the OBR to carry out the work for the first time since it was founded in 2010.  The fact that Hughes had made an intervention emerged last summer following a freedom of information request by Stuart McDonald, an SNP MP. Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget, which cut taxes as part of a package of measures designed to stimulate the economy, spooked the financial markets and led to his owndeparture and ultimately that of the prime minister Liz Truss. Official figures on Tuesday showed Hunt may have as much as £20bn spare to cut taxes in his March budget based on higher-than-expected tax receipts and lower inflation and reductions in interest rates. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that higher VAT and income-tax receipts coupled with lower spending resulted in a deficit of £7.8bn in December 2023 – the lowest for the month since the pre-pandemic year of 2019. With lower debt-interest payments also contributing to the improvement in the government’s financial position, analysts said the prospects for a giveaway package had brightened. The December deficit was more than £6bn lower than the £14bn predicted by the OBR. Hunt could use any windfall to cut taxes, increase public spending or pay down debt – or a combination of all three – but the chancellor dropped a broad hint at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos that he was planning a package of tax cuts in his 6 March budget.  With opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives are on course for a landslide defeat, the budget is seen as one of the government’s last hopes. Hunt’s scope to cut taxes is constrained by his rule that debt should be falling as a share of national income in five years’ time, but Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the analysts Capital, said the latest data showed the chancellor would meet this target with about £20bn to spare. Gregory said: “That will probably allow him to unveil a freeze in fuel duty in April 2024 (costing about £6bn a year) but perhaps also to announce more crowd-pleasing measures, such as a 1p cut to income tax (costing £6.9bn a year), while still maintaining fiscally prudent appearances.” Hughes told the Lords committee the outlook for the public finances remains “clouded” by a lack of information. A Treasury spokesperson said the government was planning to limit the growth in public spending. “We are focused on creating a more productive public sector, not a larger one, by reducing admin workloads, introducing early interventions and safely bringing in new tech like AI. This will stop the state growing ever larger and ensure taxpayers’ money is spent on the public’s priorities,” they said. Departmental spending is expected to grow at 1% a year in real terms over the next spending review, though ministers in charge of spending departments have yet to formulate their budgets to show how they will achieve expected savings."

        "content": "Here we go again. It turns out that military action can be habit-forming. Once you’ve got the taste for it, you just can’t stop. And there’s no sign of anyone reaching their rock bottom. The 12-step recovery meeting for MPs seeking help with their addiction is still seeking its first member. Just over a week ago, the Commons was packed as Rishi Sunak gave a statement about the strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen. Almost every MP wanted to have their say as they reinvented themselves as military experts on the Middle East. The session went on for the best part of two hours.   Related: Sunak faces pressure to clarify Red Sea strategy after new Yemen airstrikes   On Tuesday, the Commons was barely a third full for the start of Sunak’s latest statement after further strikes the night before. Long before the end there were just six Tory backbenchers in the house. Everyone had just got blasé. These were only targeted strikes, so what was the problem? Not something to trouble anyone. Next they will only get out of bed for a full-scale war. Sunak himself also seemed a great deal more relaxed. Ten days previously he had appeared edgy, as if slightly shaken by the seriousness of the situation. The first time as prime minister he had authorised lethal force. You could almost sense that his conscience might be slightly troubled. A hint of self-doubt. What a difference a week makes. This was lo-fi Rishi. Dressed-down Rishi. Intensely relaxed Rishi. Give him a few more days and he will be wearing a Tony Blair bomber jacket. “I said last week I would do it again,” he said. And … and he was a man of his word. You couldn’t say the Houthis hadn’t been warned. No one messed with the Rishmeister. The strikes he had ordered had been strictly in line with international law. Not often you hear this government talking about its obligations under international law. Quite the reverse. Normally Sunak has yet to find an international law that isn’t some attempt by foreigners to undermine our own sovereignty. Something deeply sinister. So I suppose we should be reassured. Then Rish! got on to the targets. As yet still unspecified. The previous strikes had been 100% successful, he declared. Though not so successful that the Houthis had not renewed their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. But never mind that. The strikes had achieved exactly what had been intended. It was just time for more of them. Now we were into the semantics of precision. Were we bombing the same targets with more precision or different targets with the same precision? These things matter. Sunak’s trust in our military capability is total. We can take out a drone launch site in someone’s back garden without inflicting a single casualty. Unfortunately we can’t prevent the Houthis from filling in the crater within a couple of hours and using the same site again to launch more drones. So this could go on indefinitely. The Houthis are quite used to being bombed. The Saudis have been doing it to them for more than a decade. So they can just shrug off a few strikes from the US and the UK. Weirdly, the Iranian-backed group don’t appear to spend their time listening to ultimatums from the British parliament. Sunak got down to the basics. He would be sending the foreign secretary out to the Middle East in the next few days. What? Run that past us again. What could we possibly expect from the Chillaxed Lord Big Dave? He’s a diplomatic liability. Guaranteed to make any situation worse through his superficiality and inattention to detail. Just think of the damage he has done to the UK. By the time he returned there wouldn’t be a country in the area that wasn’t ablaze. As before, Rish! was adamant that this was all about keeping the shipping lanes open. As if the Houthi actions were happening in a vacuum. This was madness. Sometimes you have to listen to what your enemies are saying and believe them. But the UK government line is that the Houthis are suffering from false consciousness. They may think they are trying to intervene in the war between Israel and Gaza but we know better. No one appears capable of making the link that the Houthi attacks only began after 7 October. That doesn’t mean we have to accept the Houthi narrative in full. Just acknowledge the obvious realities. But no. We prefer our own more convenient truths. “Inaction is also a decision,” he concluded. This was a Tony Blair line. One that came back to bite him. Sunak may want to be careful. Although the stakes are not as high. Almost everyone agrees the Houthis are bastards and deserve everything they get. So what was required was an action. Any action. The country demanded a futile gesture. So this was the least he could do. Pour encourager les autres. Labour’s Keir Starmer lapped all this up eagerly. He couldn’t even be bothered to make a fuss of the fact that the prime minister hadn’t got round to giving him advance warnings of the strikes this time. Just took it like a beta male. Treat me as badly as you like if you think it’s in the national interest. All Keir really wanted was for the country to be aware that he would do anything to match the Tories in the pursuit of a national interest. It would be completely unpatriotic to ask Sunak any reasonable questions. Such as: was he sure our missiles were making a difference? To check whether we weren’t making a bad situation worse. After all, there were quite a lot of Nato countries that had decided against bombing the Houthis. But the Labour leader wasn’t having any of this appeasement. He was up for anything that Rishi was. In fact, he would be willing to go far, far further. Happy to abandon all his critical faculties and bomb any place on the map. Because he too had access to these special Happy Bombs. Bombs that didn’t really do much damage. Bombs that took care to alter their trajectory in order not to inflict any casualties. So bring it on. Hell, it was probably about time we bombed Australia. They must have done something bad. Curiously, the few Tory MPs in the chamber all felt much the same way. Bathing in the warmth of their own certainty. So it was left to a handful of Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs to voice a few concerns. They had no strong feelings for the Houthis, but where was this going to end? Were we going to be bombing Yemen once a week for the next 10 years? And might it not be an idea to think about a ceasefire and a two-state solution? Just to see what happened. Sunak looked as them as if they were mad. Disloyal fifth columnists. The plan was to have no plan.  Still it wasn’t all gloom. The Tories have clearly decided that making the morning media round into comedy hour is a thing. So after Lucy Frazer and Susan Hall had done their standup routines on Monday, it was now Huw Merriman’s turn. He didn’t disappoint. The News Quiz was BBC bias, he declared. Satire will eat satire. Then he declared war on a presenter of the TV show Art Attack. Good times. Bring on tomorrow."

        "content": "Robert Booth is right to say that the planning system has become highly politicised and unpredictable (Debacle over Sphere in London spotlights UK’s problem with planning, 14 January), but this has been cynically and deliberately brought about by central government dancing to neoliberal tunes, not by town halls. Successive governments have wrongly seen planning as an economic threat rather than the major player in sustainable development that it should be. And communities need to have their voices heard, including via locally elected representatives. Both councillors and local people often point out shortcomings in developers’ more destructive demands – and in rosy visions of “can-do planners” dreaming of carving their names on the landscape in new towns. Instead, they’re reduced to shouting from the margins. Environmental challenges such as climate change, food and water supply, drainage, flooding, sea defence and protection of nature, and societal challenges such as inequality, social housing and regional imbalances, are growing. We need a stronger and wider planning system.Jon ReedsSmart Growth UK • Your article omits several crucial points, including the massive cuts in planning services in local government since 2010 and the importance of informed democratic input to planning policy and decision-making. The article appears to support the case for deregulation of planning on behalf of disgruntled developers who didn’t get permission to build what they wanted. Let’s hope the next government will learn from examples of badly designed extensions and conversions of offices to flats that have gone ahead in England under expanded “permitted development” rules (ie with no planning oversight), despite spoiling our suburban streetscapes and producing substandard living accommodation. They should not try to change planning legislation, but should increase funding of local government to enable it to tackle key issues such as increasing resilience to climate change via long-term strategic planning. Kay S PowellRetired planner, Cardiff • Property developers are not blameless for uncertainty in the planning system. It’s a matter of routine for developers to accompany planning applications with a “viability assessment”, pleading that they cannot provide the affordable housing that is required under local planning guidance. These viability assessments allow developers to set their own benchmark for what makes for a profitable development, and duck out of building homes that people can actually afford if they don’t hit that profit benchmark. Local planning authorities, if they are mindful of what kind of development is most needed in the local community, are then faced with the choice of contesting a developer’s proposals or conceding to its demands, for fear of getting nothing.Jerry FlynnLondon • James Dolan’s decision to abandon his Sphere concert venue planning application in London must be the biggest ever example of someone going home and taking their ball with them.Allan ForsythSalhouse, Norfolk • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Speaking in a Commons debate on a Labour motion to legislate to set up a national register of children not in school, she said:\n\n\nIt is a national scandal that every day, every week, so many children are not in school. Absence from school is not simply a problem in itself, it is a symptom of deeper problems and a cause of further problems.\n\nLabour lost the vote by 303 votes to 189 – a majority 114.\n\nUpdated at 5.45pm GMT\n\n\n 5.18pm GMT \nTrust in government in UK has fallen sharply in recent years, survey shows\n\nEdelman, a global PR firm, has for more than 20 years been publishing a global survey showing how much people in different countries trust institutions such as their government or media. The 2024 figures, out today, are quite damning for the Conservative party and Rishi Sunak’s administration. Here is an extract from the Edelman news release.\n\nSince 2021, trust in government overall fell by 15 points while, trust in local government also plummeted, from 53% to 41% over the same period. The timeframe suggests the incumbent government led by Rishi Sunak hasn’t been able to shake off the impact of either the Partygate scandal or the economic shock of Liz Truss’s short-lived tenure as prime minister.\nA record high 69% of people now believe that the government only serves the interests of certain groups – up 23 points since 2021; 63% of people believe the government is “corrupt and biased” – again up 23 points since 2021; while less than a quarter (24%) consider government “honest and fair”; and 3 in 5 (60%) deem the government “completely ineffective as an agent of positive change”, another record change – up 19 points since 2021.\n\nThe report also contains a chart showing the UK near the bottom of a list of countries for trust in government, with trust falling seven points on the previous year. The figures are based on replies when people were asked if various institutions in their countries could be trusted to do what was right.\nBut look who comes top: Saudi Arabia, followed by China, both repressive regimes. This suggests that in some countries this particular trust index is not so much a measure of the inherent integrity and honesty of the government in charge, but more a measure of whether people feel it is safe to criticise their rulers when responding to opinion polls.\nThe 30% figure for the UK is still very poor when ranked against more comparable countries, such as France (39%), Germany (42%) and Ireland (45%). But it is not a record low; Edelman says this is just the lowest figure since 2012.\n\nUpdated at 5.22pm GMT\n\n\n 4.37pm GMT \nOfficial advised Humza Yousaf on how to avoid wearing mask, UK Covid inquiry hears\n\nHumza Yousaf was allegedly advised on how to avoid wearing a face mask in public by one of Scotland’s most senior health officials at the height of the Covid crisis, a public inquiry has been told. Severin Carrell has the story here.\n\n Related: Official advised Humza Yousaf on how to avoid wearing mask, UK Covid inquiry hears \n\n\n\n\n 4.34pm GMT \n\nAlmost all anti-Labour statements from CCHQ these days include a reference to the party’s plan to spent up to £28bn a year on green investment, and that is true of the one it has released this afternoon about Labour’s plan to get high street opticians seeing more NHS eye patients. (See 11.56am.) In response, the Tories issued this statement from Dame Andrea Leadsom, a health minister. She said:\n\nIn Wales where Labour are in charge fewer than half of eye care patients are being seen within the target time.\nLabour can’t say how they’d pay for this announcement. Because just like their reckless £28bn-a-year spending spree they don’t have a plan – meaning less money for the NHS. \n\nLabour has said it would not put up taxes, or break its borrowing rules, to fund the £28bn pledge, but the constant attacks on the policy has made it nervous and, as Kiran Stacey reported last week, the future of the pledge is being reviewed.\n\n Related: Labour to hold crunch talks on future of £28bn green investment plan \n\n\n\n\n 4.24pm GMT \nChris Heaton-Harris signals he hopes power sharing in Northern Ireland can resume by 8 February\n\nIn posts on X, Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, has confirmed that the government will put off the legal moment when the absence of a power-sharing executive at Stormont has to trigger new elections until 8 February.\nIn a sign he thinks that by then the DUP might have been persuaded to lift its boycott, he says he thinks this delay will be “sufficient”.\n\n\nTomorrow I will be introducing the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill to allow for the reformation of Stormont.The Bill only has a single clause: to extend the period of time Stormont can legitimately come back until the 8th February.(1/2)— Chris Heaton-Harris MP (@chhcalling) January 23, 2024\n\n\n\nTomorrow I will be introducing the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill to allow for the reformation of Stormont.The Bill only has a single clause: to extend the period of time Stormont can legitimately come back until the 8th February.\n\n\nI am committed to restoring devolution and significant progress has been made towards that objective.

Asked by Sir Michael Ellis (Con) about the use of misleading logos/colour schemes by campaigners, Edwards said this was an example of the sort of misinformation or disinformation that was becoming more common. She went on\n\nIf you follow the trend of complaints that we have about [misinformation or disinformation], it would be pretty exponential …\nThe sort of instances you are talking about impact on public confidence … We as the commission do have a role in making that very clear to the people that might be actually putting these things out ... It’s quite clear that the public, their confidence falls if they see examples of misinformation or disinformation out there.\nWhen it comes to legitimate political parties doing this about other political parties, you would hope actually that having it pointed out that this is undermining public confidence in democracy is a factor they would take into account.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.43pm GMT\n\n\n 3.23pm GMT \n\nPenny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, has told MPs that the Commons will consider all stages of a short bill on Northern Ireland tomorrow before they get on to the debate about the air attacks on the Houthis and the situation in the Red Sea.\nLegislation is required because the current deadline for the formation of a power-sharing executive has passed and, without a new bill, new assembly elections would have to take place. The government wants to avoid that and, according to the BBC, it will instead legislate to make 8 February the new deadline.\nMinisters are engaged in talks which they hope will persuade the DUP to lift its boycott of power sharing, which has lasted almost two years.\n\n\n\n 3.12pm GMT \nMPs pay tribute following death of Labour veteran Tony Lloyd\n\nSir Tony Lloyd was hailed as a “great man of Manchester” by Rishi Sunak as the House of Commons gathered to say goodbye to the Labour MP, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe 73-year-old’s family watched the tributes in the chamber, with some MPs also seen wiping away tears as they listened.\nLloyd died on 17 January only days after announcing that he was suffering from an incurable form of leukaemia.\nThe Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, recalled his final phone call with Lloyd after he left hospital, saying: “Tony made it so easy for me and he was that kind of person – he put me at ease when it was meant to be the other way around. He made sure it wasn’t a difficult conversation. I didn’t know that would be the last time we’d ever speak but I’m so glad we did. We’ve not only lost a great colleague and friend, the country has lost one of the nicest, most effective MPs.”\nSunak said Lloyd was an “enormously decent man who gave his life to public service”, adding: “In his penultimate contribution in this house, Tony said that change can happen and we must fight for the change we want to see. From the beginning of his career right to the end, Tony Lloyd lived those words. He was a great family man, a great man of Manchester and a great man of the House of Commons. He will be missed but he and the change he fought for and achieved will never be forgotten.”\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, addressing Lloyd’s family, said: “I hope they can take some comfort in the memories and tributes of colleagues today, and I hope they see just how much Tony was loved and respected here in this house and how much he managed to achieve in his decades of public service.”\nStarmer added he was able to convey to Manchester United fan Lloyd the “high esteem in which he was held by everyone”, adding: “I hope it did give him some comfort and support in those final days.”\nLloyd was first elected to represent Stretford in 1983 and also served as MP for Manchester Central following boundary changes. He would go on to serve in the influential position as chair of the parliamentary Labour party between 2006 and 2012 before standing down from parliament to successfully contest the election for police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester. Lloyd returned for a second stint in the Commons and represented Rochdale from 2017.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.16pm GMT\n\n\n 2.54pm GMT \n\nMPs heard that children in Gaza were now having to have their limbs amputated without anaesthetic. The point was made during the statement by Rishi Sunak, where he came under pressure over the UK’s position on the conflict there and the Israeli prime minister’s doubling down of his opposition to a two-state solution.Labour’s former shadow chancellor John McDonnell asked the prime minister:\n\nDoes he not realise without an immediate ceasefire any strategy, any hope of a strategy succeeding, will fail and the Netanyahu cabinet has now become an obstacle to peace rather than a partner in peace?\n\nMcDonnell also cited an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme with a doctor in Gaza who said that the desperate shortage of medical supplies meant he was having to amputate the limbs of children without anaesthetic.MPs also sought to press the prime minister on the comments by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who said last week he has told the US that he opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state once the conflict in Gaza comes to an end.Netanyahu’s words had “inflamed hopes for peace” and echoed the views of Hamas, Sunak was told by the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, who cited reports that the death toll in Gaza had reached 25,000. Her own relatives were still trapped there.“While you might want to have hope I daresay it has turned to complete despondency,” she added.An “immediate” pause was now needed to get aid in and hostages out of Gaza, said Sunak, who told MPs that they should not draw a link between the situation in the Red Sea and Gaza and that the UK would recognise Palestinian statehood “at a time which best serves the peace process”.\n\nUpdated at 3.24pm GMT\n\n\n 2.45pm GMT \nNo 10 claims Lords defeat won't hold up implementation of Rwanda policy\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning No 10 indicated that last night’s Lords vote would not hold up the passage of the Rwanda bill through parliament.\nPeers defeated the government by passing a resolution saying it “should not ratify the UK-Rwanda agreement on an asylum partnership until the protections it provides have been fully implemented, since parliament is being asked to make a judgment, based on the agreement, about whether Rwanda is safe”. In voting for it, peers were endorsing the conclusions of a report from the cross-party international agreements committee.\nThe UK-Rwanda agreement, or treaty, underpins the new Rwanda bill, because it supposedly ensures that Rwanda will be a safe country for asylum seekers – as the bill asserts. The Lords committee said it was too early to know those safeguards are in place.\nBut the House of Lords does not have the power to block treaties, and so the government can ignore the vote saying ratification of the treaty should be delayed. The PM’s spokesperson indicated that that is what would happen. Asked what would happen next, he told reporters:\n\nThe treaty will continue to follow the usual processes in terms of scrutiny and ratification … Ultimately government can decide to issue a statement in the House of Commons on the treaty, and that shouldn’t impact our timelines for the progress of the bill and getting flights off the ground.\n\nUnder the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, which governs how treaties are ratified, the Commons can delay ratification of a treaty. The Lords does not have that power, and if the Lords does vote against a treaty, the government can go ahead and ratify it anyway, provided it publishes a statement explaining why it is doing that.\nThe spokesperson also said that the Lords committee did not find anything objectionable in the treaty itself and he said that implementation by Rwanda of the measures in the treaty are supposed to be in place by the spring, when the government hopes flights might start.\n\nUpdated at 2.49pm GMT\n\n\n 1.44pm GMT \nPay for civil servants in data, digital and AI could rise to ensure vacancies get filled, minister says\n\nCivil servants taking jobs in data, digital and AI are set to get higher pay to help fill shortages, John Glen, the Cabinet Office minister, has said.\nThe minister said he would review the pay structure for these expert areas as he seeks to transform productivity in Whitehall.\nIn a speech at the Institute for Government conference Glen, who has been in the job for 10 weeks, also set out plans to:\n\nReview civil service “networks” to ensure their impartiality, having previously briefed the Daily Telegraph that he was leading a crackdown on “activism” in Whitehall during working time.\n\n\nMake sure senior civil servants are in the office more than 60% of the time, which is the amount mandated for all Whitehall workers.\n\n\nLaunch a new performance management framework for civil servants to make it easier to get rid of underperforming employees or help them to improve.\n\n\nWork towards a “smaller, more skilled civil service that is better rewarded” and reduce reliance on expensive contractors.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.06pm GMT\n\n\n 1.31pm GMT \nGovernment publishes summary of legal advice justifying air strikes against Houthis\n\nThe government has published a summary of its legal advice justifying the air attacks last night. It says the justification is the same as it was for the attacks on 11 January. Here is an excerpt.\n\nThe Houthis have been carrying out dozens of serious attacks on shipping in the Red Sea for a sustained period. British flagged vessels, as well as the vessels of many other States, have been the subject of those attacks. On 9 January, this culminated in an attack against HMS Diamond, involving multiple drones. Those attacks against shipping in the Red Sea continue, with 10 further attacks since 11 January. The government assesses that attacks will continue unless action is taken to deter them.\nMilitary intervention to strike carefully identified targets in order to effectively downgrade the Houthi’s capabilities and deter further attacks was lawfully taken. It was necessary and proportionate to respond to attacks by the Houthis and this was the only feasible means available to deal with such attacks.\nThe UK is permitted under international law to use force in such circumstances where acting in self-defence is the only feasible means to deal with an actual or imminent armed attack and where the force used is necessary and proportionate.\n\n\n\n\n 1.22pm GMT \n\nAndrew Gwynne (Lab) says Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, are not committed to a two-state solution. So what is the UK doing to make it happen?\nSunak says the UK government is committed to the two-state solution, and is working with allies to make it happen.\n\n\n\n 1.17pm GMT \n\nStephen Timms (Lab) asks why, given Sunak claims there is international support for the air attacks, only two countries have participated.\nSunak says Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and Bahrain supported the mission. And he says a dozen countries said they back what is happening.\n\nUpdated at 2.18pm GMT\n\n\n 1.15pm GMT \n\nJohn Crace, the Guardian’s sketch writer, says there is not a lot of interest in today’s statement from backbenchers.\n\nA week ago the Commons was packed for Sunak’s statement after strikes on Yemen.

But he says it has been sanctioned as an entity.\n\nUpdated at 1.10pm GMT\n\n\n 1.05pm GMT \n\nValerie Vaz (Lab) asks how many civilian casualties there have been from the UK attacks.\nSunak says the intelligence suggests there were no civilian casualties from the first attack, and the intention was to minimise them again in the attacks last night. He says there is no evidence to suggest there were any civilian casualties.\n\n\n\n 1.01pm GMT \n\nEd Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said that, although he was glad the Commons is debating the airstrikes tomorrow, he thought there should be a proper vote. And he said Sunak had not sufficiently explained how he would avoid regional escalation.\n\nUpdated at 1.15pm GMT\n\n\n 12.59pm GMT \n\nAlicia Kearns, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, said the government should have a strategic approach to tackling all Iran’s proxies and allies in the region, “so we don’t end up playing whac-a-mole”.\n\nUpdated at 1.15pm GMT\n\n\n 12.56pm GMT \nSNP's Stephen Flynn challenges PM to explain why these airstrikes might work when Saudi bombing campaign didn't\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says “it’s fair for the government to use proportionate and robust action to defend their right to freedom of navigation”.\nBut he goes on:\n\nThe Houthis have been under almost constant bombardment from Saudi Arabia for the best part of eight years. They didn’t get that message. So why are we so confident that they will get our message this time around?\n\nSunak says doing nothing would also have involved a choice. It would have been the wrong choice “because it would be tantamount to ceding control of a global shipping route, which is economically vital, to a dangerous militant group, which is backed by Iran and putting innocent lives at risk”.\nHe stresses that the airstrikes are only part of a wider strategy.\n\nUpdated at 12.59pm GMT\n\n\n 12.51pm GMT \nSunak sidesteps question about whether campaign against Houthis will be 'prolonged'\n\nJerermy Quin, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, asks the PM if this may need to be a “prolonged” campaign.\nSunak says no decision has been taken to embark on a sustained campaign. The government reserves the right to act in self defence, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.49pm GMT \n\nIn response to questions raised by Starmer, Sunak said the government would shortly published a summary of its legal advice relating to the attacks.\nAnd he says the government was alive to the risk posed by Iran in the region.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer told MPs that Labour would judge action against the Houthis on a case-by-case basis. And it supported what happened last night, he says.\n\nUpdated at 12.55pm GMT\n\n\n 12.46pm GMT \n\nSunak told MPs the airstrikes were only part of a “wider response” to the Houthis being taken by the government.\nHe said the government was increasing diplomatic engagement in the region, working to end the supply of arms to the Houthis, using sanctions to try to cut off their funding and delivering humanitarian aid to help people in Yemen who have suffered from the civil war.\nHe claimed that there was no link between what the government was doing and the conflict in Gaza. But people who glorified the Houthi attacks were glorifying terrorism, and that would be met by a zero tolerance response, he said.\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.41pm GMT \nSunak tells MPs Britain attacked Houthis again because they pose ongoing threat to UK shipping\n\nSunak is addressing the Commons now.\nHe says the UK decided to join the airstrikes against the Houthis yesterday in response to intelligence showing they presented an ongoing threat to UK shipping.\nHe says, as with the first round of attacks in which the UK participated, the action was fully in line with international law, and targets were carefully selected.\nSince the first airstrikes on 11 January, there have been further attacks on shipping, he says.\n\nWe have already shot down dozens of missiles and drones and civilian vessels and that the Royal Navy and the Houthis have conducted at least 12 further attacks on shipping since 11 January, including just last night shortly before our strikes were conducted, so we reacted to further degrade their ability to mount such attacks.\nLast week, I gave the house our initial assessment of the first wave of strikes. Since then, we have seen further evidence that they were successful in degrading the duties military capability.\nLast night, we hit two military sites just north of Sana’a, each containing multiple specific targets, which the Houthis used to support their attacks on shipping.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.34pm GMT \nStarmer not told about airstrikes in advance due to 'operational security and strike timelines', No 10 says\n\nAt the No 10 lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said Keir Starmer, as leader of the opposition, and Sir Lindsay Hoyle, as Commons speaker, were told about the air strikes at the time they were happening, at around 10pm.\nAsked why Starmer and Hoyle had not been told in advance, the spokesperson said No 10’s preference was to inform them in advance. But he said that in this instance “operational security and strike timelines” did not allow that.\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.28pm GMT \nSunak to give statement to MPs about UK's further involvement in airstrikes against Houthis\n\nRishi Sunak will be giving a statement to MPs at 12.30pm about the UK’s involvement last night in another round of airstrikes against the Houthis. It is the second time the UK has joined with the US in attacking installations in Yemen being used by the Houthis to attack shipping in the Red Sea.\nAt cabinet this morning Sunak told his colleagues the initial signs were the attacks had been effective. In a readout of what was said, the PM’s spokesperson said:\n\nThe prime minister opened cabinet with an update on last night’s strikes which have further degraded the Houthis’ ability to attack civilian and military ships, endanger lives and disrupt trade in the Red Sea.\nThe prime minister said the initial signs are that the strikes were effective.\nThe prime minister said that we took this action, together with our allies, because we continue to see an ongoing and imminent threat to UK vessels, and those of our partners, with the Houthis launching about 12 attacks on shipping in the Red Sea in the last 10 days.\nWhile we are not seeking a confrontation, we will not hesitate to act in self-defence to protect British lives and interests.\n\nThe spokesperson also said MPs would hold a general debate on the airstrikes tomorrow, although it was not going to invite the Commons to vote for a substantive motion approving them.\n\nUpdated at 12.36pm GMT\n\n\n 11.56am GMT \nLabour says it would use high street opticians to cut waiting lists for NHS eye treatment\n\nLabour would let optometrists provide tests and outpatient appointments for medical eye problems in high street opticians, a shadow health minister told the Institute for Government conference.\nFilling in for Wes Streeting, who is ill, Karin Smyth said it would address the 620,000 patients currently waiting for NHS eye care, with 17,000 waiting over a year. It has previously been revealed that hundreds of NHS patients lost their eyesight following delayed appointments.\nThe party said it would seek to negotiate a national deal to deliver more routine outpatient care in high street opticians, using existing funds. This would include cataract pre-assessments and operation follow-ups, glaucoma monitoring, and common diagnostic tests.\nSmyth said it would free up hospital specialists to treat more serious cases and provide better value for money. Labour highlighted that the plan had support from expert opthamologists. Prof Ben Burton, president of the Royal College of Opthalmologists said:\n\nWhile expanding ophthalmology infrastructure and workforce capacity is essential and must be prioritised, we should also be making better use of the existing expertise and facilities in high street optical practices to manage stable, chronic conditions. The Labour party’s announcement today is therefore a positive commitment to supporting eye care patients and we would offer our clinical expertise to shape this policy if delivered in government.\n\nSmyth also expanded on Streeting’s comments briefed overnight that Labour would wage a war on waste in the NHS, which have provoked a backlash on the Labour left.

The event is meant to happen before the middle of 2024.\nBut, according to a report in the Financial Times, Downing Street has not yet set a date – and European diplomats think that is because Rishi Sunak has not entirely ruled out a spring election. The FT says:\n\nEuropean diplomats believe the UK government’s refusal to rule out a snap general election this spring lies behind “delays” to an upcoming meeting of the European Political Community in Britain. \nSeveral EU ambassadors have grumbled privately that officials in London have been dragging their feet over agreeing a date for the summit, which insiders said was initially expected to take place in March or April. \nWhile Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has indicated that a general election is most likely to take place in the second half of the year, European diplomats suspect the fact he has not completely excluded the possibility of a May poll explains the absence of a date for the summit …\nAnother senior EU official said the delay had added to speculation about the UK election date. “We keep asking for a date and they [the UK] say they can’t give us one ‘for obvious reasons’, which we take to mean they have not fully decided about the election.”\n\n\n\n\n 11.17am GMT \n\nDiane Abbott, who was shadow home secretary under Jeremy Corbyn and who is currently suspended from the parliamentary Labour party, has also said Wes Streeting is wrong to downplay the need for more investment in the NHS.

(See 9.26am.) One (seemingly obvious and easy) reform would be to waste less, and in the overnight preview of his speech Labour identifies “waste” in the NHS worth billions of pounds that it suggests could be eliminated. It cites these five examples.\n\n£1.7 billion cost of hospital beds for patients who are well enough to leave, but can’t because there is no care available in the community\n£3.5 billion paid to recruitment agencies because the Conservatives have failed to train enough staff over the last 14 years\n£626 million spent by the Department of Health and Social Care on management consultants\n£32 million value of the pagers NHS staff are still forced to use\n£1 billion of savings the NHS itself says is available through bulk-buying equipment at a cheaper rate. Currently some hospitals pay twice as much as others for equipment like scanners and surgical tools.\n\nStreeting says:\n\nWith a government that understands the value of public money, that is brave enough to reform the NHS, that knows prevention is better than cure, the crisis in the health service can be turned around.\nI am focusing on waste because I want to give the public hope that the NHS can be saved. The money that is wasted today can be used to get the NHS back on its feet tomorrow. Only Labour has a plan to reform the NHS.\n\nIn his Sun interview Streeting also claims that the NHS could save money and become more efficient by embracing technology properly. He says:\n\nThis morning DPD text-messaged to tell me this parcel was being delivered, they gave my slot and gave me the opportunity to change it.\nWhy is it that with the NHS you can’t turn around and say, ‘Actually, that isn’t convenient, I need to change it?’ Or you think, ‘Oh, shit, I forgot about that’.\nIt’s just those basic things, that basic organisation of the system. And this is not revolutionary technology.\n\n\n\n\n 9.54am GMT \n\nDavid Cameron, the foreign secretary, has urged peers to back the government’s Rwanda bill after the House of Lords last night voted for a motion intended to delay its implementation.\nAs Rajeev Syal reports, peers voted for a motion saying ratification of the UK-Rwanda treaty, that underpins the Rwanda bill going through parliament, should be delayed until Rwanda has shown that it has enacted the legal reforms set out in the treaty intended to show it is a safe country for asylum seekers.\n\n Related: Sunak’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda receives first parliamentary defeat \n\nThe vote will not stop the government ratifying the treaty, but it may make it harder for the government to fight off legal challenges to the policy in the courts.\nCameron, who sits in the Lords, said in response:\n\nWhat the government will do is, having passed the bill through the House of Commons, bring the bill to the House of Lords, and I’ll be urging fellow peers in the House of Lords to vote for that bill because it’s absolutely essential that we stop the boats and that we fulfil the prime minister’s plan.\nIt’s not acceptable to have people travelling from a perfectly safe country – France – to another safe country – Britain – and to be able to stay, and that’s what the Rwanda plan is all about and why I urge the House of Lords to pass this bill.\n\nAs the division list shows, only one Conservative peer, the Earl of Dundee, voted with the opposition parties and crossbenchers for the motion saying treaty ratification should be delayed.\n\nUpdated at 10.01am GMT\n\n\n 9.41am GMT \nJeremy Hunt has room for £20bn tax cuts after borrowing halves year on year\n\nA halving of UK government borrowing over the past year has created scope for Jeremy Hunt to make tax cuts worth about £20bn in his March budget, Larry Elliott reports.\n\n Related: Jeremy Hunt has room for £20bn tax cuts after borrowing halves year on year \n\n\n\n\n 9.39am GMT \nFresh US/UK airstrikes ‘send clear message’ to Houthis, says Cameron\n\nA fresh set of US and UK airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen were intended to “send the clearest possible message that Britain backs its words and our warnings with action”, David Cameron, the foreign secretary, has said.

Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is the main speaker at a conference organised by the Institute for Government thinktank today and, according to the overnight briefing, his speech will be an attack on “waste” in the NHS, and a declaration that Labour will make it more efficient. This is a relatively standard opposition party theme. The Conservatives used to say much the same when Labour was in power. But Streeting has also given an interview to the Sun to promote his message, and this will attract more attention because he has used it to accuse his own party of being too nostalgic about the NHS.\nHe told the paper:\n\nI think there are times when the Labour party is led too heavily into nostalgia. It would be the easiest thing in the world to go into the next general election just saying ‘worst crisis in NHS history’, ‘you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS’, ‘you’ve got 24 hours to save the NHS’ and, by the way, here’s a nice sepia film of Nye Bevan.\n\nWhen the Sun’s Harry Cole put it to Streeting that that was exactly how Labour campaigned on the NHS in elections, Streeting replied:\n\nWell, we haven’t done very well in the last four, so I’m not planning to repeat those mistakes.\n\nStreeting also restated an argument that he has previously made as shadow health secretary, saying that what the NHS needed most was reform, not extra money.\n\nYou can’t just keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of money into a leaky bucket, you’ve got to deal with the bucket itself.\n\nAnd on the topic of NHS funding, he told the Sun:\n\nIt’s not right to keep on asking people on low to middle incomes to pay high taxes when they’re struggling. And it’s not right that they don’t get much for the money they are putting in.\n\nI will post more from the interview and speech shortly.\nOtherwise, we have cabinet today, and we are expecting a Commons statement from Rishi Sunak on the latest air strikes against the Houthis. There is full coverage of those on our Middle East crisis live blog.\n\n Related: Middle East crisis live: Israel president calls deaths of 21 Israeli soldiers in single Gaza attack an ‘unbearably difficult morning’ \n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n9.15am: Wes Streeting, shadow health secretary, gives a speech at the Institute for Government’s annual conference. Other participants include Kwasi Kwarteng, the Tory former chancellor, who is speaking on a panel, and John Glen, the Cabinet Office minister, who is giving a speech. The full agenda is here.\nMorning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n11.30am: Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\nAfter 12.30pm: Rishi Sunak is expected to make a statement to MPs about the latest air strike against the Houthis.\nAfter 1.30pm: MPs debate a Labour opposition day motion which, if passed, would set aside a day for the Commons to debate and pass a Labour bill on school absences that would force the government to set up a national register of children not in school.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "Almost 4 million people have yet to file their self-assessment tax return, even though the deadline is just eight days away – prompting HM Revenue and Customs to issue an “act now” plea designed to chivvy people into action. Those who miss the deadline potentially face penalties including late payment interest at a rate of 7.75% – the highest for 16 years – which means HMRC could be in line for “a windfall” this year, accountants have said. This year, more than 12.1 million people are expected to file a return for the 2022-23 tax year by the deadline of 31 January. On 9 January, HMRC said about 5.1 million taxpayers still had not done so, and on 23 January it said the number who had yet to send back their form stood at 3.8 million. In a release headlined “Less distraction, more action!,” the tax collector said those who had yet to tackle their form “are urged to act now or risk facing a £100 penalty”. A late tax return will incur an immediate £100 fixed penalty, which applies even if there is no tax to pay or the tax bill is paid on time. After three months there are additional penalties of £10 a day, up to a maximum of £900, with further penalties after that. There are also penalties for any tax that is paid late, with interest charged as well. This late payment interest rate was last year lifted to 7.75% – the highest rate since early January 2008, when it was 8.5%. Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC’s director general for customer services, said: “If you are a self-assessment taxpayer, now is the time to take action and get your return done.” Last year about 600,000 customers missed the 31 January deadline. The numbers affected by self-assessment have grown over the years: a decade ago it was a little over 10 million, climbing to 11.4 million by 2018. There could be thousands of people who have been drawn into the self-assessment net for the first time in the 2022-23 tax year, said accountancy firm BDO. Many may be unaware of their obligations to file a return and could run the risk of penalties. “These new filers could include parents claiming child benefit whose salaries crossed the £50,000 threshold for the first time in the 2022-23 tax year and who will have to repay some or all of their benefit through the ‘high income child benefit charge’,” said Dawn Register, head of tax dispute resolution at BDO. Others could include higher earners whose salaries exceeded £100,000, or pensioners who earned more than the “personal savings allowance” of up to £1,000 of interest because of higher savings rates. Alternatively, they could be working people whose “side hustle” earnings went above £1,000 during the tax year. BDO said HMRC “could be in line for a windfall in 2024 if people don’t file their tax returns on time”.  It added: “With many more people likely to have crossed the threshold at which they are required to file a tax return, there is a risk of a significant increase in the number of people who don’t meet the 31 January deadline.”"

        "content": "A fresh set of US and UK airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen were intended to “send the clearest possible message that Britain backs its words and our warnings with action”, David Cameron has said.\nThe foreign secretary insisted he was confident that attacks carried out 10 days ago by Britain and the US had had an effect on degrading the Houthis’ abilities to attack shipping in the Red Sea.\n“Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis in the Red Sea,” he told the BBC.\n“These attacks are illegal, they are unacceptable. What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action.”\nHowever, unlike the previous strikes by the US and UK, with support from allies, the British government had failed to brief the opposition, the Labour party has said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, was also not consulted on this occasion, it is understood.\nKarin Smyth, a shadow health minister, said Labour had not been briefed ahead of fresh allied strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n Interactive\n\nSpeaking to GB News, she said: “We don’t know why the government haven’t spoken to us on the usual terms. We would expect them to do that. We would certainly expect a statement by the prime minister today in parliament, so we will await developments on that.”\nStarmer and the Commons speaker were consulted 10 days ago in their roles as members of the privy council, but it is understood that this did not happen this time.\nRishi Sunak is expected to make a statement to parliament on Tuesday, where Labour will press for further details of the government’s strategy and a summary of the legal advice that was drawn on before the strikes went ahead.\nThe Liberal Democrats accused the government of again “bypassing” MPs as the UK joined US military action.\n“Liberal Democrats are concerned about the Houthis’ attacks in the Red Sea and so we support the case for limited strikes, so long as they remain limited,” said the party’s leader, Ed Davey.\n“However, it is absolutely vital that parliament has an opportunity to have its say, via a debate and a vote. The prime minister has so far failed to grant either. It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives are being bypassed on an issue as important as military action.”\nSunak was criticised 10 days ago for not informing parliament before airstrikes were carried out.\nHuw Merriman, a transport minister, insisted during an interview on Sky News that this had not been the case.\n“The leader of the opposition and the speaker were given that information. My understand is that that information was conveyed, which is what I have been told,” added Merriman, who said the government was not ruling out further strikes.\nThe US and UK said they had conducted “an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes” against eight Houthi targets, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.\nThe number of targets is considerably lower than the 60 struck in the first air raids on Yemen made by the two countries 10 days earlier, while their effect and the number of casualties caused is uncertain.\nThe latest raid marks the eighth time the US has conducted strikes on Houthi targets this months and the second time that the UK has participated."

        "content": "Labour is planning to use an opposition day debate motion to bring forward legislation for a new register of children who are not in school as part of plans to tackle persistent absenteeism. New Labour analysis found that “one in three children currently sitting their GCSEs have missed nearly three months of secondary school since the pandemic” and said this was likely to affect academic attainment. The motion will seek to take control of the parliamentary order paper to enable the passage of a children not in school (national register) bill, to create a council-maintained register of children not on the school roll. The measure, which will cover home-schooled children, has attracted widespread support across parliament and beyond, and was included in earlier government legislation, the schools white paper, that was dropped two years ago. Speaking in December 2022, the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, told MPs on the education committee that a register of children not in school was “a priority” but it did not feature in the king’s speech last November. Keegan reaffirmed the government’s commitment last November and is supporting Conservative MP Flick Drummond’s private members’ bill with the same aim. Speaking before Tuesday’s motion, the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “There is no time to waste if we are to tackle the biggest challenge currently facing our schools – that is why Labour’s motion is so essential, and represents the first step of our long-term plan to get to grips with persistent absence.” Labour’s compulsory national register of home-schooled children was announced by Phillipson this month, when she laid out Labour’s plans to reduce “frankly terrifying” levels of pupil absence in schools in England in the wake of the pandemic. It would place a legal duty on councils to keep a register of all children who are not in school and on parents to provide information about their child’s education at home. Under Labour’s plans, children in England would be given a unique number to link records held by schools, health visitors and councils to stop any child falling through the gaps. The motion will say: “That this house condemns the secretary of state for education for her failure to tackle the crisis of persistent school absence.” It “calls on the government to immediately introduce legislation to amend the Education Act 1996 in order to establish a mandatory duty on local authorities in England to maintain a register of eligible children not in school, as set out in part 3 of the schools bill [Lords] published in the 2022-23 parliamentary session; and therefore makes provision as set out in this order”. Phillipson will attack the Conservatives’ record on education. “Conservative MPs, including the current schools minister and two former schools ministers, claim to support the register of children not in school but yet again have failed to deliver,” she said. “The secretary of state has said it is her priority to legislate on a register ‘in the very short term’: that is why Labour is giving her and her Conservative colleagues an opportunity to make good on her pledge.” A government source said: “We are committed to legislation for a children-not-in-school register and have committed to progress with this when legislative time allows.”"

Nigel Farage weighed in, provocatively saying “We must sack all current members of the House of Lords.” It was unclear what constitutional mechanism he was referring to when claiming the lawmakers must be “sacked.\nShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the government’s free childcare plan as being in “tatters,” after reports that staffing and IT problems were hampering the rollout.\nSunak spoke to US president Joe Biden, discussing the military and humanitarian situations in Gaza, the Red Sea and Ukraine after US-UK airstrikes in recent weeks.\nThe train drivers’ union Aslef will stand down its five days of additional strikes at LNER, after the state-owned operator withdrew plans to impose minimum service levels during next week’s industrial action.\nScotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf has asked to speak to Labour leader Keir Starmer about Westminster-Holyrood relations if Labour is to form a government.\nMeanwhile, Starmer is keen to show he’s not up for ducking a fight from the Conservatives, in response to critics that he has run away from key battles so far, as his electoral strategy continues to evolve.\n\nThat’s all from me, Jem Bartholomew in London, and from the UK politics blog for today. Thanks for following the Guardian’s live coverage. See you next time. \n\n\n\n 8.47pm GMT \nRight-wingers attack Lords after delay to Rwanda scheme over safety concerns\n\nAfter the UK’s upper lawmaking chamber voted 214-171 to delay the passing of a UK-Rwanda treaty to provide offshore immigration detention – to provide further time for scrutinising safety concerns – right-wing politicians were quick to attack the House of Lords.\nThe hard-right, anti-immigration Nigel Farage, an ever-present worry over the right-shoulder of Conservative leaders, said provocatively on X/Twitter: “We must sack all current members of the House of Lords. It is beyond parody.” It was unclear what constitutional mechanism he was referring to when claiming the lawmakers must be “sacked.”\nMeanwhile, the UK Independence Party, which former-leader Farage left in 2018, said on X/Twitter: “ABOLISH THE HOUSE OF LORDS!”\nThe comments are a taste of what prime minister Rishi Sunak can expect from backbenchers and other right-wing campaigners, who are urging him to begin sending asylum seekers to Rwanda – and seem prepared to topple him as leader if he can’t.\n\nUpdated at 8.50pm GMT\n\n\n 8.07pm GMT \n\nMore reaction to the government’s major setback on the Rwanda offshore immigration policy to come. But first, my colleagues Pippa Crerar and Patrick Butler have this great piece on Labour leader Keir Starmer’s evolving strategy – and willingness to fight. Read the full piece below.\n\nIn the coffee break after Keir Starmer’s speech on civil society on Monday, the mood among charity leaders was positive. Perhaps most of all they liked his defence of the National Trust and RNLI, beloved national charities that have, over the years, been demonised and demeaned by the right.\n“It’s come to something when the Tories are at war with the National Trust,” the Labour leader had told them. “That’s what happens when politics of self-preservation prevail over commitment to service.”\nHis speech was also symbolic of a broader strategy from Starmer, who has been looking for opportunities to flip the narrative and show that he is not just ducking fights with the Tories to deny them electoral dividing lines, as some of his critics suggest.\nThis same strategy was on display earlier this month when he told reporters he was “up for the fight” of defending the “nanny state” as he announced plans to improve child health under a Labour government, including supervised toothbrushing in schools.\n\n\n Related: Keir Starmer keen to show he is not just ducking fights with the Tories \n\n\n\n\n 7.41pm GMT \nHouse of Lords kicks Rwanda offshore immigration treaty into long grass\n\nThe House of Lords has voted 214-171 to delay prime minister Rishi Sunak’s flagship UK-Rwanda immigration treaty, with the major setback likely to enrage right-wing Conservatives and put Sunak’s administration on the back foot again.\nTonight’s votes centred on delay motions from Labour peer Lord Goldsmith, chairman of the chamber’s International Agreements Committee, which presented a report identifying ten sets of issues where “significant additional legal and practical steps are needed in order to implement the protections the treaty is designed to provide,” Goldsmith said.\nGoldsmith added: “We are not saying the treaty should never be ratified but we are saying that Parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise the treaty and its implementing measures in full before it makes a judgement about Rwanda is safe.”\nThe UK’s upper lawmaking chamber joins a list of other institutions in the British constitution who have thrown doubt on the viability and safety of No 10’s immigration plan – the Court of Appeal in April last year, then the Supreme Court in November.\nSunak has framed these setbacks in a quasi-presidential way, as an assault on its ability to pass laws and on the “will of the people” – despite Rwanda offshoring not being included in the 2019 Conservative manifesto – whereas opponents say the separation of powers is performing its constitutional role in sinking an unlawful policy.\nIn this way, the treaty debate has also became a proxy for disagreement over the makeup of Britain’s unwritten constitution.\nIn a statement ahead of the vote, Labour frontbencher Lord Vernon Coaker said the chamber was doing its “proper constitutional role” to analyse the treaty further, attacking Sunak’s “lecturing.” In response, Home office minister Baron Andrew Sharpe said, “This begs the question, is Labour using the House of Lords to try to frustrate our plan to stop the boats?”\nThe Rwanda plan, initially launched by Boris Johnson as prime minister in April 2022, was struck down by the Supreme Court in November, declared unlawful over concerns the safety of people seeking asylum could not be guaranteed in Rwanda – particularly the risk of being returned to their country of origin.\nDriven by critics on the right, Downing Street has tried to find a route around the ruling by ratifying a legally-binding treaty with Rwanda in parliament. The prime minister was able to dodge a rebellion from the Tory right earlier this month after last-minute crunch talks with 45 rebel MPs, sending the bill to the Lords with a majority of 44.\nThe policy has been also attacked by opposition parties, campaigners and human rights lawyers, for its impact on the lives of people seeking asylum, its expensiveness, and its risk for the UK to breach international obligations across a slew of human rights treaties. The government says it will help “stop the boats” across the English channel.\nBefore peers debated the bill, Sunak ratcheted up the pressure. “Will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected house?” he said in a press conference. “Or will they get on board and do the right thing? It’s as simple as that.”\nSince Sunak became prime minister on 25 October 2022, following Liz Truss’s resignation, the Lords has defeated the government 125 times, according to a count from the Constitution Unit at University College London. Since the 2019 election, the government has been defeated on 374 votes – though significant setbacks such as tonight’s are rarer.

And nobody, least of all the prime minister, should hold press conferences, lecturing us about what our role is, when all we seek to do is to improve it, and to act in our proper constitutional role.”\nCoaker referenced Sunak’s presser earlier this week urging the Lords to enact the “will of the people,” interpreted by some critics as a means of leaning on the upper lawmaking chamber.\n\nUpdated at 7.24pm GMT\n\n\n 6.49pm GMT \n\nPrime minister Rishi Sunak spoke with US president Joe Biden on Monday, discussing geopolitical, military and humanitarian issues in the Red Sea, Gaza and Ukraine.\n“They talked about what’s going on in the Red Sea and the need for a continued international multilateral approach to disrupting and degrading Houthi capabilities,” White House spokesman John Kirby told Reuters.\nThey also discussed bringing down civilian casualties and increasing humanitarian assistance in Gaza, as well as Ukraine war funding.\nIt came after the UK and US have taken part in joint airstrikes in recent weeks from warplanes, ships and submarines, hitting Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation for attacks on shipping traffic.\n\nUpdated at 6.49pm GMT\n\n\n 6.43pm GMT \n\nThe statements in the upper chamber in this evening’s debate on the UK-Rwanda treaty have so far swayed towards concern and alarm at the government’s plan, suggesting the House of Lords might choose to delay the bill in the soon-to-come vote.\nBut there have been voices who said they are in favour of passing the treaty as it stands.\nConservative Lord Richard Balfe, in his statement, attracted headlines for questioning whether anywhere in Africa is “particularly safe” and said he could not think of “any country in Africa that I would wish to go and live in. But maybe it is safe. We don’t know.”\nHe added: “We need to realise that the whole international migration system... has got out of hand. \n“If we’re going to cure it, we’ve got to do it as a European entity”, he said, adding “we’ve got to start off by rebuilding the countries of the Middle East that we smashed to pieces”.

He rightly believed that such international architecture, based on the rule of law, democracy, human rights, security and economic recovery, represented our best hope for the future.\nHe also says, “The government rightly insists that the criminal mafia like gangs, who make their fortunes by preying on the desperation and misery of the vulnerable, must be hunted down and jailed.”\nBut, he goes on, “the question today is simply whether we can honestly say that Rwanda is a safe country”; and it’s also about “the separation of powers between judiciary and parliament”, as Sunak tries to get around the Supreme Court’s unlawful ruling.\nHe raises concerns about Rwanda’s human rights record, political oppression and treatment of LGBT people.\n\nUpdated at 5.57pm GMT\n\n\n 5.30pm GMT \n\nLord Tim Razzell, Liberal Democrat, provokes chuckles in the upper chamber as he argues the government’s immigration policy is based on an irony: \n“If we go back to the beginning, the whole reason for the proposals to send people to Rwanda was because it was going to be such a hell hole that nobody will would want to get on a boat if they thought they were going to go to Rwanda.\n“But of course, the dilemma that the government now faces, is because of the Supreme Court [striking it down in November for being potentially unsafe], they have to demonstrate what a wonderful, safe place Rwanda is. And I do wonder whether that might just be a moment for them to reflect on the purpose of their policy.”\nHe added that the policy is “a classic case of two and two adding up to make five.”\nWe’re an hour away from the scheduled vote on the treaty. Rishi Sunak will be hoping more peers take their feet to argue in favour of the treaty as the minutes tick down. \n\n\n\n 5.17pm GMT \n\nSpeaking a moment ago in the Lords was Labour’s Baroness Ruth Lister, who is emphasising, among other things, the potential impact on vulnerable children if the treaty is rushed into existence.\nFor children arriving int he UK whose ages are in dispute, she says, “there is a very real possibility that they will be removed to Rwanda, and if subsequently found to be under 18, sent back to the UK in a cruel human pass-the-parcel, which is likely to be very distressing for children who almost certainly have gone through considerable trauma.”\nThis, Lister points out, would be in breach of the UK’s obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

In just over an hour’s debate so far, all but a couple of people have spoken in favour of postponing ratification.\nShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the government’s free childcare plan as being in “tatters” after reports that staffing and IT problems were hampering the rollout. Sunak admitted there were “some practical issues”, but Downing Street said the government remained “confident” of delivering the policy. Children, families and wellbeing minister David Johnston said in parliament that no parents would miss out.\nOfsted school inspections in England resume this week after a two-week pause to allow inspectors to undergo mental health awareness training.\nMore than 40 Conservative MPs – including seven former cabinet ministers, some with responsibility for local authority funding – have threatened Sunak with a fresh rebellion after writing to demand more funding for councils in England to avoid deep cuts to services.\nEleven Conservative MPs – including former ministers Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick – are reported to have been called in by government’s chief whip Simon Hart to explain themselves over last week’s rebellion against the Rwanda bill.\nDavid Frost, the influential Conservative peer who has been criticised for claiming that rising global temperatures could be beneficial to the UK, is being appointed to a key parliamentary committee on the climate crisis.\nThe train drivers’ union Aslef will stand down its five days of additional strikes at LNER after the state-owned operator withdrew plans to impose minimum service levels during next week’s industrial action. It would have been the first test of enforcing “minimum service levels”.\nScotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf has written to Keir Starmer, inviting him to his official Edinburgh residence Bute House, to discuss how relations between the Scottish and UK governments might be improved in the event of Labour winning the next general election.\nDUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party has not yet reached an agreement with the government over post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nThat is it from me, Martin Belam, for today.

He describes the foundation as an “educational charity in this area”.\nEd Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, said Frost’s appointment showed that Sunak was trying to keep those seeking to oust him onside.\nRead more of Ben Quinn’s report here: Peer who praised rising temperatures appointed to climate crisis committee\n\n Related: Peer who praised rising temperatures appointed to climate crisis committee  \n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm GMT\n\n\n 4.36pm GMT \n\nHere is part of what Lord Goldsmith said in the House of Lords about the UK-Rwanda treaty as the debate there opened:\n\nIn total our report identifies at least 10 sets of issues where on the basis of the government’s evidence significant additional legal and practical steps are needed in order to implement the protections the treaty is designed to provide. The difficulty is that the government has already presented a bill to parliament asking it to make a judgment that Rwanda is safe now.\nAnd yet on the home secretary’s own evidence it cannot be so. because the measures are not in place and have not been shown to be effective. The treaty is held up by the government as the justification for the measures in the bill and yet the treaty cannot at present provide a basis for parliament to judge that Rwanda is safe while so many aspects of the treaty remain unimplemented and untested.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.37pm GMT\n\n\n 4.33pm GMT \n\nPaula Barker, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, has issued a statement to say that her Instagram account has been cloned, and that today she has found out that her family, friends and followers are being targeted with scam messages as a result.\nShe states that she has reported this to Instagram’s owners, Facebook’s parent company Meta.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/cbx2S69OZ9— Paula Barker MP (@PaulaBarkerMP) January 22, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.35pm GMT\n\n\n 4.28pm GMT \n\nI’ve not been doing a minute-by-minute of the House of Lords debate about the UK-Rwanda treaty, but suffice it to say that it will not have made welcome listening for Rishi Sunak and his government, as so far every speaker has been against the immediate ratification of the treaty.\n\n\n\n 4.26pm GMT \n\nHere is a bit more of what the childcare, children and families minister, David Johnston, said in parliament after an urgent question was granted. He told MPs:\n\nWe want parents to be able to access the offers as soon as they can, delivering that ambition has included us increasing childcare funding rates with an additional £204m this financial year and an additional £400m in the coming financial year.\nWe are providing grants to help new childminders into the sector, and making changes to the early years foundation stage that the sector has asked us to make it easier for them.\nWe will be issuing letters with temporary codes to any parents whose tax free childcare reconfirmation date falls on or after 15 February and before 1 April, this will ensure that any eligible parent who needs a code to confirm their funded childcare place with their provider will have one and no parents should worry that they will lose out.\n\nThe shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, described the plan as being in “tatters”, telling the Commons:\n\nCrumbling school buildings, botched school budgets, and now the hat-trick – a childcare pledge in tatters because of Conservative bungling, and it’s not ministers opposite but families across this country paying the price for Tory incompetence.\nAnd how did we get here? A litany of failures, a pledge without a plan, a department without a grip, led by minsters without a clue. Families without the certainty of a childcare place they were promised by the Chancellor last March and meanwhile the department is facing another £120m shortfall because of yet another miscalculation.\nFamilies are facing a rolling wave of Conservative chaos which wrecks all before it. Providers, an utter fiasco, where their income after April still a state secret. When will providers be told about their funding rates? How many families does he estimate will now not be able to access new hours because of this shambles?\n\nIn an answer that may come back to haunt him, Johnston told her: “She asks how many families won’t be able to access the childcare offer as a result of these two issues, the answer is none.”\n\nUpdated at 4.35pm GMT\n\n\n 4.17pm GMT \n\nThe House of Commons has an urgent question on measles, which was declared a UK national health incident last week.

Evidence that these arrangements have bedded down in practice is also needed. In short, the treaty is unlikely to change the position in Rwanda in the short to medium term.\nWe recommend that the treaty is not ratified until parliament is satisfied that the protections it provides have been fully implemented since parliament is being asked to make a judgement, based on the treaty, about whether Rwanda is safe. The government should submit further information to parliament to confirm that all the necessary legal and practical steps and training which underpin the protections provided in the treaty have been put in place, and then allow for a further debate before proceeding to ratification.\n\nThe full 21-page report is available here.\n\nUpdated at 4.09pm GMT\n\n\n 3.57pm GMT \n\nDUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party has not yet reached an agreement with the government over post-Brexit trading arrangements. \nPA Media reports that speaking to in Belfast, Jeffrey said:\n\nTo date no agreement has been reached in our negotiations with the government and there remains a number of important issues that have to be finalised if we are to see a restored assembly and executive. To be clear, we want to see the re-establishment of the executive and assembly and we’re working towards that objective.\nThe DUP wants to secure an agreement that provides the basis for the institutions to function with stability and in a way that is meaningful for everybody in Northern Ireland. Building sustainable foundations is vital to allowing Northern Ireland to move forward and to secure support from both unionists and nationalists.\nFactually, we have made further progress on many of these issues since Christmas and have worked constructively with the secretary of state and his team on the issues which include matters relating to the Windsor framework and those elements where we need to see significant improvements.\n\nDonaldson said he would be meeting with the government again this week in an attempt to “close remaining gaps”.\nHe was also defiant about reports there had been a “make or break” DUP meeting on Friday, telling reporters:\n\nWe will not be giving a detailed and running commentary on our internal meetings … on Friday I provided our party officers with a detailed update on the contacts and discussions we have had with the government.\nI’m afraid the so-called senior DUP sources who made this claim are ill-informed, they are not people who are around the party officer table, they are not people who are privvy to all of the detail that the party officers have been dealing with. None of this spooks me, fazes me.

She said they were not retained on her phone but she had obtained copies for the inquiry.\nNonetheless, the relaxed attitude to record-keeping – and those who may wish to view records in the future – has been apparent, with the clinical director Jason Leitch recorded as joking about his nightly “pre-bed routine” of WhatsApp deletion.\nThis comes as Scotland’s information commissioner said today the revelations suggested FoI rules were being “subverted” and threatened to launch an investigation, and as Covid bereaved families prepare to lodge police complaints about the apparently wholesale deletion by Sturgeon and others.\nSturgeon will give evidence herself next week.\n\nUpdated at 3.03pm GMT\n\n\n 2.21pm GMT \n\nJust a note that these are the provisional timings for the Commons this afternoon, via PA Media:\n\n14.30 Levelling up, housing and communities questions\n15.30 An urgent question on funded childcare\n16.15 An urgent question on measles\n17.00 Offshore petroleum licensing bill – second reading\n\n\nUpdated at 2.28pm GMT\n\n\n 2.18pm GMT \n\nGovernment communications strategy had a bit of a retro look about it this morning at Westminster, where a town crier was wheeled out to announce that the UK government had launched a new official WhatsApp channel.\nA Cabinet Office press release to accompany the launch said: “The channel will be a publicly run information service, similar to gov.uk or official government social media accounts.

In the wake of a government review which suggests Ofcom should have greater oversight of the corporation’s output, and the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, asserting during her media round that the BBC had “on occasion” been biased [See 9.20am], Sunak was asked about the BBC and impartiality.\nVisiting the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, Sunak said impartiality was an “important tenet of our media industry”.\nHe went on to say:\n\nI think all elements of the media industry have to be subject to the same impartiality rules. I think that’s what people would expect and that’s what makes our media institutions so great. We have a free and fair press and impartiality is at the heart of what makes the BBC a strong institution.\n\nThat phrase “all elements of the media industry have to be subject to the same impartiality rules” has raised eyebrows, as that would appear to encompass print and digital publications as well as broadcast media.\nA Downing Street spokesperson denied Sunak misspoke, and said: “I think you’re getting into the semantics of which regulator oversees which section of the media. He was making a general point about the importance of the media landscape.”\nHere is the clip from this morning of the culture secretary, who said “I think that on occasion it has been biased, yes” about the BBC, but then declined to name specific examples beyond the corporation issuing an apology over its reporting of one attack on a hospital in Gaza.\n\n\nGovt says there’s evidence of bias at the #BBC ?But Culture Sec @lucyfrazermp can't quite find the words or examples…#KayBurley FC pic.twitter.com/I0Xocpf7PK— Kay Burley (@KayBurley) January 22, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.32pm GMT\n\n\n 1.01pm GMT \n\nAdding to Rishi Sunak’s earlier comments that he wanted to reassure parents over reports of problems with the rollout of the expansion of free childcare provision, Downing Street has said it was “confident” that childcare places would be available for those eligible.\nPA Media quotes the prime minister’s spokesperson saying: “We are confident that the provision and capability is there, we are confident in the strength of the market place.”\n“We’ve been working very closely with the sector,” they added, as the policy entails “switching from parents paying for this care to effectively the government stepping in to ensure that provision is there”.\nMy colleague Alexandra Topping has just filed her report on the issue, with the top line:\n\nMinisters have found an 11th hour “workaround” to address parents’ concerns around accessing new free childcare hours, in an attempt to get a grip on chaos surrounding the pledge’s rollout.\nThe Guardian understands that after a week of frantic discussions in the Department for Education (DfE), charities and groups representing the early years were called to an emergency meeting on Monday morning to hear the department’s attempts to solve the crisis.\nParents of two-year-olds who qualify for free childcare in April are now to be given an automatic code to allow them to access funded hours. But early years providers said it would do little to address a staffing crisis that would limit the number of places available to parents.\nThe government workaround comes after a flash survey from the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed revealing that only one in 10 eligible parents had the code they needed to get the free hours.\n\nRead more of Alexandra Topping’s report here: Ministers attempt to rescue free childcare rollout with last-minute ‘workaround’\n\n Related: Ministers attempt to rescue free childcare rollout with last-minute ‘workaround’ \n\n\nUpdated at 1.07pm GMT\n\n\n 12.24pm GMT \n\nSally Weale is the Guardian’s education correspondent\nSchool inspections in England resume this week after a two-week pause to allow inspectors to undergo mental health awareness training [see 11.14am], but education unions have called for more far-reaching reform, including the scrapping of single-word judgements in Ofsted inspections.\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT school leaders’ union, said: “The initial steps Ofsted has taken ahead of resuming inspections this week, are welcome – but NAHT believes it would have been better for inspections to be ungraded while more fundamental, far-reaching reform takes place.\n“That means not just enabling school leaders to raise concerns and pause inspections, but also to tackle the root causes of the intolerable pressure they pile upon school leaders and their staff, which can have such a dangerous impact on their wellbeing.\n“It also means reforming inspections to ensure they provide a fairer, more reliable assessment of a schools’ strengths and weaknesses, including scrapping single-word judgments.”\n\nUpdated at 12.50pm GMT\n\n\n 12.08pm GMT \n\nChris Mason at the BBC is reporting that 11 Conservative MPs – including former ministers Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick – are being called in by government’s chief whip Simon Hart to explain themselves over last week’s rebellion in the Commons against Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda bill. The report suggests it is for an informal warning.\nMason says: “Senior government figures say the meetings, which are often standard practice after a high-profile rebellion, are ‘about sending a message that rebelling is not going to be tolerated going forward’.”\n\nUpdated at 12.15pm GMT\n\n\n 11.44am GMT \nSunak: 'some practical issues' with rollout of increased free childcare plan\n\nA little bit more from Rishi Sunak’s broadcast appearance this morning. As well as criticising Keir Starmer’s speech this morning [See 11.09am], Sunak responded to the news that was the main splash in the Times today, that the government policy on offering free childcare was running into problems. Sunak admitted there were “some practical issues” with the plan.\nThe prime minister insisted the project would go ahead as planned in England despite reports of problems with the allocation of funding, staff shortages and IT issues. He told the media:\n\nWe are excited about our plans to expand childcare in a way that has never been done in our country before. This spring, everyone with two-year-old kids will be able to get 15 hours, that will be expanded to all those with nine-month-olds later this year and then obviously next year 30 hours for all of those, completing the biggest expansion of childcare in our country’s history.\nNow, many families have been able to sign up and it’s all working fine, but there are some practical issues that certain families are facing. I just want to reassure all of those people that those issues are being resolved as we speak, all of those families will get the childcare that they are eligible for.\n\nOliver Wright and Aubrey Allegretti had reported overnight that the policy was being undermined by what the Times described as a “funding fiasco”:\n\nSenior Whitehall sources said lights were “flashing red all over the board” over the £4bn plan as nurseries warned that they will not be able to start the scheme in time. They have not been told how much they will be paid for each of the places on offer despite the fact it is due to be up and running in less than three months.\nMany nursery chains have told existing parents that they cannot guarantee that their children will be entitled to the new free hours while others have said that it will be “impossible” to extend the offer to nine-month-olds in September.\nAt the same time IT complexities with HMRC systems mean that up to 25,000 families will need to re-confirm their status with the taxman in March or face delays in accessing the new payments.\nIn addition, the department for education is also facing a £120m budget shortfall after miscalculating the cost of the scheme in its first year.\n\n\n\n\n 11.14am GMT \nOfsted school inspections in England to resume this week after two-week pause\n\nSally Weale is the Guardian’s education correspondent\nSchool inspections in England resume this week after a two-week pause to allow inspectors to undergo mental health awareness training, after an inquest into the suicide of Reading primary head teacher Ruth Perry ruled that the schools inspectorate Ofsted had contributed to her death.\nPerry’s school, Caversham primary, was downgraded from outstanding to inadequate over safeguarding issues during an Ofsted inspection, that the inquest heard had triggered a fatal deterioration in Perry’s mental health.\nThe mental health awareness training was ordered by the new chief inspector, Sir Martyn Oliver, who said he would do everything in his power to prevent any future tragedies after taking over in January.\nFrom today, schools across England could receive a call from the inspectorate, ahead of a visit. Under new Ofsted arrangements, however, once the inspection is under way, the lead inspector or the school can request that an inspection be paused for up to five days in exceptional circumstances.\nHeadteachers remain concerned however. Executive principal Vic Goddard, of Educating Essex fame, posted on social media: “Knowing that the @ofsted call could come tomorrow for up to 4 of our schools certainly changes how I feel and not for the better. I’m an experienced and generally robust leader. It’s not right is it?”\n\nUpdated at 11.18am GMT\n\n\n 11.09am GMT \n\nRishi Sunak has been asked by the media for his reaction to Keir Starmer’s speech, which the prime minister said he hadn’t heard. He went on to say “it does sound to me like a distraction from the fact that Keir Starmer, who has been leader of the opposition for four years, can’t actually say what he would do differently to run this country”.\nTelling broadcasters that Starmer “doesn’t have a plan”, Sunak said:\n\n[He] can’t say how he’d bring the number of small boat arrivals down, can’t say how he would fund his £28bn green spending spree, which just means higher taxes.\nAnd the contrast is clear. Our plan is working. The boat numbers are coming down, the longest waits in the NHS have been virtually eliminated and this month we’re cutting people’s taxes.\nSo if we stick with the plan, we can build a brighter future. The alternative is just to go back to square one with Keir Starmer, he doesn’t have a plan and he can’t tell you what he would do differently.\n\nOn the claim that “the longest waits in the NHS have been virtually eliminated”, about 6.39 million patients across England were waiting for routine hospital treatment in November, down slightly from 6.44 million in October, but the NHS in England is still failing to hit most of its key performance targets. 11,168 people had been waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment at the end of November, and A&E times have also worsened in England, with 69.4% of patients seen within four hours in December, against a target set for March this year of 76%.\nHealth has been a primarily devolved matter for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland since 1999.\n\nUpdated at 11.19am GMT\n\n\n 11.02am GMT \n\nLibby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent\nScotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf has written to Keir Starmer, inviting him to his official Edinburgh residence Bute House, to discuss how relations between the Scottish and UK governments might be improved in the event of Labour winning the next general election.\nIt’s no secret that relations between Westminster and Holyrood have been turbulent over the past few years – a cursory glance at evidence from the UK covid inquiry will tell you that.\nBut this is an interesting move from Yousaf, as he attempts to counter Scottish Labour’s appeal to independence voters to defect from the SNP in order to secure Starmer in Downing Street.\nIt’s also puts Starmer in a tricky position – not wanting to alienate those very independence supporters whose votes he is relying on, but also well aware of previously successful Tory attacks about Labour’s relationship with the Nationalists – remember the 2015 image of tiny wee Ed Milliband poking out from Alex Salmond’s pocket?\nIt is interesting too that, in his letter, Yousaf sets out specific policy areas he wants to discuss with Starmer – child poverty, just transition, the ongoing cost of Brexit – rather than going straight for the section 30 jugular.\nWhen Yousaf succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as first minister, he asked for a S30 order to grant Holyrood the powers to hold a second referendum at is first meeting with Rishi Sunak. Perhaps this is an acknowledgment that voters are increasingly turned off the endless process-driven back and forth on independence and are keen to see both Scottish and UK governments concentrate on what they consider more pressing concerns around cost of living. \n\n\n\n 10.49am GMT \n\nKeir Starmer has finished his appearance at the Civil Society event. He praised the voluntary sector, and said they would be a vital part of Labour’s plan for a “decade of national renewal”.\nHe attacked the Conservative party, saying: “The Tory party has undertaken a kind of weird McCarthyism, trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect.”\nHe said the Tories seem set on “sabotaging civil society to save their own skin”, adding: “It’s desperate, it’s divisive, it’s damaging.”\nHe did at one point raise a small – possibly wry – laugh from the audience by saying that Rachel Reeves won’t allow him to make funding commitments at events like this when he was being asked if a Labour government would devote more funding to a particular cause.\n\nUpdated at 10.50am GMT\n\n\n 10.28am GMT \n\nStarmer has said in this Q&A that the current government after 14 years is going to leave the country worse off than they found it, and that is unforgiveable for a political party, any political party, he says. He stresses again he is talking about a “decade of national renewal” because it isn’t just about fixing things but fixing them and then improving them, and it has to be sustained over more than five years.\n\n\n\n 10.23am GMT \n\nStarmer says that he is convinced that among the main problems of the last 14 years has been “sticking plaster” politics which “mask the problem for a short period of time” but then when they come off they usually reveal an even bigger problem. During his speech he said that real and lasting change takes longer than the election cycle, and talked about a decade of work that needed to be done.\n\n\n\n 10.22am GMT \n\nClare Moriarty, managing director of Citizens Advice, is now doing a Q&A with Keir Starmer at the Civil Society event.

You can watch that live here.\nSome of the content has already been trailed, including that he is planning to defend the National Trust and the RNLI, accusing the Conservatives of attacking them to stoke a “desperate” culture war.\nMy colleague Kiran Stacey previewed this overnight, writing:\n“The Tories seem set on sabotaging civil society to save their own skins,” Starmer will say. “They got themselves so tangled up in culture wars of their own making, that instead of working with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution – an organisation the late queen was patron of for 70 years – to find real solutions to stop the small boats, their rhetoric has helped demonise them.”\n“Instead of working with the National Trust so more people can learn about – and celebrate – our culture and our history, they’ve managed to demean their work. In its desperation to cling on to power, at all costs, the Tory party is trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect.”\nIn 2019, the RNLI was criticised by Conservative backbenchers for spending money on anti-drowning charities abroad. It then came under fire in 2021 from Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who accused the institute of acting as a “taxi service for illegal immigration” because of its work helping distressed asylum seekers in the Channel.\nThe National Trust, Britain’s largest charity, has been torn apart by an internal battle over its stance towards rewilding Britain’s countryside and how to depict the links between the properties it oversees and the UK’s colonial legacy.\nIn 2022 a group headed by a Conservative donor and including two “anti-woke” historians launched an attempt to gain control of the charity, while the Tory MP Andrew Murrison set up a parliamentary group to “scrutinise” its work.\n\nUpdated at 10.11am GMT\n\n\n 9.53am GMT \n\nJust a quick note that one of the ministerial statements due to be made in the Commons on Monday includes an update on the measles situation.

Rishi Sunak’s immigration policy faces its next hurdle today as the House of Lords debates a motion seeking to delay the proposed new UK-Rwanda treaty. Sunak, who was appointed prime minister by Conservative MPs, and is yet to face an election as party leader, has made much of the fact that the Lords are unelected and are opposing a policy which he claims has broad public support. Voters appear to think differently, with a YouGov survey earlier this month suggesting a narrow majority is in favour of scrapping the plan altogether.\nHere are the headlines\n\nThe culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, has said she believes the BBC has “on occasion” been biased in the wake of a government report which recommends more oversight from Ofcom – including oversight of digital offerings such as the BBC News website.\nEvery vote counts – the Conservatives have hired a coordinator to get expat supporters to vote in the general election.\nThe UK’s fruit and flower growers face an “existential threat” from new post-Brexit border checks, the country’s biggest farming body has said.\nAberdeen suffered the worst growth in the UK over the last decade, with a study finding that the average UK person has lost out on £10,200 since 2010.\nThere is a “good chance” the UK may have fallen into technical recession.\nOn the NHS, figures show one in 20 patients in England wait at least four weeks to see a GP.\n\nIn Westminster the Commons is sitting this afternoon, with oral questions on levelling up and then a debate on the second reading of the offshore petroleum licensing bill. The Lords, as mentioned, will be debating the proposed UK-Rwanda treaty. In Wales the Senedd has committee meetings. The Scottish parliament is not sitting.\nIt is Martin Belam with you today.

        "content": "In the coffee break after Keir Starmer’s speech on civil society on Monday, the mood among charity leaders was positive. Perhaps most of all they liked his defence of the National Trust and RNLI, beloved national charities that have, over the years, been demonised and demeaned by the right. “It’s come to something when the Tories are at war with the National Trust,” the Labour leader had told them. “That’s what happens when politics of self-preservation prevail over commitment to service.” His speech was also symbolic of a broader strategy from Starmer, who has been looking for opportunities to flip the narrative and show that he is not just ducking fights with the Conservatives to deny them electoral dividing lines, as some of his critics suggest. This same strategy was on display earlier this month when he told reporters he was “up for the fight” of defending the “nanny state” as he announced plans to improve child health under a Labour government, including supervised toothbrushing in schools. Party insiders also point to more historic examples such as Starmer’s defence of the England team during Euro 2020 when he accused Boris Johnson of a lack of courage over his reluctance to condemn fans who booed them for taking the knee. Last February he defended the BBC – a frequent target of Tory attack – as a “national treasure” that, along with Channel 4, which faced privatisation, had to be defended from government attacks that “threaten the future of these two great institutions”. Labour strategists believe Starmer’s willingness to take on the Tories – even if defending the National Trust might not seem the riskiest of tactics – flies in the face of claims he is reluctant to do so for fear of it being weaponised at the election. “We always knew that the final year before an election would be about picking sides on things,” one senior aide explained. “It’s not really about the individual rows: we’re trying to tell more of a story about what the party stands for.” His team want to present him as a “normal bloke” – presumably in contrast to Rishi Sunak’s out-of-touchness – who will take a pragmatic approach generally shared by the majority of the country. “There are issues where we think we’re in the mainstream of public opinion,” said one shadow cabinet minister. “What the Tories think is the mainstream has been pulled in ever more extreme directions. That’s why he feels quite confident making those arguments.” Another party insider suggested that dividing lines were chosen carefully. “We’ve always wanted to make the Labour party the natural patriotic choice and we’re always looking for opportunities to do that. It’s a fairly reductive Conservative view that everybody is quite rightwing on everything”. The Labour figure said, however, that Starmer had to strike the right balance between “not being baited by mad things the Tories come out with” and waiting for the right moment “like a boxer ducking and diving and picking the right approach”. More importantly, it is not just culture war issues that have been picked to create some dividing lines, but also significant policy areas like illegal immigration. Starmer has said that he would repeal the government’s flagship Rwanda legislation if he wins power. Again, he cites pragmatism. The policy would not work in practice, he argues, although it does highlight Tory division and Sunak’s depleted authority on the issue. He would, instead, seek an EU-wide returns agreement for people who seek asylum in Britain. Several shadow cabinet ministers refer to Starmer as the “quiet radical”, insisting that his five “mission documents” are actually extremely ambitious – even if they have been criticised in some quarters for their lack of detail – because he actually intends to deliver on them. His dividing lines strategy, however, has its limits. The Labour leader has said little to differentiate himself from the government on issues including transgender rights, public sector pay, the two-child benefit cap and even his position on a Gaza ceasefire. His aides deny this proves his reticence to take on difficult issues, arguing instead that it would be easier to take the path of least resistance by siding with Labour activists, and he has “taken brickbats” from his own side as a result. Perhaps the biggest test of his boldness is yet to come: to stand firm on Labour’s commitment to its £28bn green prosperity fund or decide that he would be electorally better off if he backed away. One party insider said: “It’s about fight or flight. We don’t yet know which is his instinct.”"

        "content": "What’s the purpose of Rishi Sunak’s government? It clearly isn’t to govern. The Tories have long since given up on that. Nothing really works any more and Sunak has little to offer but the promise of a few general election giveaways. But his outriders are clearly on a mission to plug the gap with entertainment. Banish those Monday morning January blues with the Conservatives’ comedy hour. The Revenge of the Idiocracy. Step forward, Lucy Frazer. In a previous life, Frazer was by all accounts a successful barrister. Someone even thought her sharp – or posh – enough to make her a KC. Though what that says about all the other lawyers whom she beat to the promotion doesn’t bear mentioning. There’s no easy way of saying this. But Lucy just isn’t very bright. If the election doesn’t work out so well for her, you can’t see many people hurrying to her chambers asking her to take up their case. As luck would have it, though, Frazer is now our culture secretary. Words you thought you would never say. The least you would expect would be someone who could talk in fully formed sentences. Coherent thought would be nice too. Come back, Nadine Dorries. Even at her most demented, even when she was totally pissed, Mad Nad was more articulate than Frazer on Monday’s media round. Almost as though Lucy was auditioning for her own standup show. A rival to Rosie Holt. For reasons best known to themselves, every Tory culture secretary seems to have it in for the BBC. It could just be jealousy. The BBC is far more highly valued and trusted than the Tories. We Brits could easily do without the services of another second-rate minister, but we’d be pissed off to be asked to give up our guilty pleasures of The Traitors and Silent Witness. No matter. Frazer had managed to get hold of another shoddy piece of research that claimed the BBC was not impartial and was determined to spin it out into a comedy gig on the airwaves. A helpful suggestion: most standups learn their routines before they take them out on tour. They don’t just make it up as they go along. But Lucy knows better. All she had done was skim the headline findings that the BBC were all lefty bastards before leaving the house in the morning and had decided to ad-lib the rest. It didn’t go well. Frazer clearly thought she would be on home turf in the Sky studios. That a rival broadcaster would like nothing more than to indulge in a bit of communal Beeb bashing. The idea that a news source might have independent news values clearly hadn’t occurred to her. She clearly thought everything was like GB News. Kay Burley cut to the chase. “Do you think the BBC is biased?” she asked upfront. “Er … I am looking at this from, um … the point of view as culture secretary,” said Frazer in her trademark high-pitched panicky nasal whine. Much the same as Sunak. Burley looked around for a gun. Anything to put herself out of the misery of spending another second with this halfwit. “I know you are,” she said. “That’s why we’ve invited you on to the programme.” Poor Lucy. Yet to make the connection between her role as cabinet minister and being invited on to the TV. She thought it was just a coincidence. Then we got down to the details. Or rather the lack of them. Frazer did think the BBC was biased because it had apologised for a mistake about the bombing of a Gaza hospital. Her dishonesty was transparent. Because you could tell that what she was itching to say but daren’t was that the BBC hated the Tories. Which some members and presenters probably do. Though equally, the boss class and some other presenters are very Tory-friendly. Which suggests that overall things are a lot more balanced than at GBeebies. “So where’s your evidence?” asked Burley. Frazer looked confused. Startled even. “Evi … Evi … Evi … dense?” What was that? Yup, she’s a lawyer alright. Er … the evidence was that some people perceived the BBC to be biased, she offered. Burley gently pointed out that perceptions were not evidence and invited her to have another go. Still nothing. Eventually Burley just gave up, spitting her out in disgust. Weirdly, Frazer repeated this interview across all the networks. Someone should tell her there’s a difference between an audience laughing at you and with you. Still, Frazer was just the warm-up act on LBC. There we got a full half-hour of Comedy Central with the Tory candidate for London mayor. The never-to-be-forgotten Susan Hall. Quite possibly the stupidest person in the entire capital. The Conservatives must have chosen her for the LOLs. There’s no other explanation. First off, Hall insisted that Sadiq Khan had saved up some money to give Londoners a pre-election boost. Wait until she finds out what Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have in store. Then she got totally confused over the repairs to Hammersmith Bridge. The holdup was because it was owned by two councils. A listener had to call in to point out that this was a lie. Since 1985 it’s been owned solely by Hammersmith and Fulham council. Though Hall may think that counts as two. But Sue was only getting started. She was definitely going to give the police a pay rise though she didn’t know where the money was coming from. The presenter, Nick Ferrari, asked her if she knew what the basic salary for an officer was. “No idea,” she said proudly. But guessing? £30K. Which is the equivalent of £60K. Honestly, no one had any idea what she was talking about. Least of all, her. “It’s £36K,” said Ferrari. Her ignorance was bliss. And total. She didn’t know what a bus fare was. Couldn’t give a toss. She never took one. Only travelled by trains. So nothing to do with her. And she was unrepentant about her tweets about Trump having the 2020 election stolen from him because she “always spent a lot of time on Twitter liking tweets that she didn’t really like”. Ferrari looked like he needed a self-help group by the end. We all did. But hey, the LBC phone lines all lit up. With agents looking to sign Dim Sue up. This had been laugh-a-minute radio. Far better than anything Radio 4 could offer. And no one was laughing louder than Sadiq. Imagine Hall as mayor of one of the world’s biggest cities. Even my dog could do better. And still the fun wasn’t over, as hours later Liz Truss announced she would be making her comeback in February. The Edinburgh fringe is dead. Long live the Tory fringe. Our cup runneth over."

        "content": "A Labour-affiliated trade union that was found to have fostered a culture of sexual harassment and coercion over more than a decade is facing new allegations of bullying. A leaked letter shows that staff at the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) claim to be working in a “toxic environment”, leaving many with anxiety and hypervigilance. Their representatives are calling for the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service to intervene, claiming there has been an “abject failure” to follow procedures on bullying. Insiders say there have been three new allegations in recent months. Last year, the TSSA was overhauled and a group of senior figures stood down after an independent report by Helena Kennedy KC. The general secretary of 11 years, Manuel Cortes, was dismissed for gross misconduct. Lady Kennedy concluded that women were subject to sexual touching and manipulative behaviour over many years. She also heard evidence of failings in due process, natural justice and governance. A TSSA insider rejected the allegations and said specific details had not been put to the union by staff reps. A leaked letter sent to the new general secretary, Maryam Eslamdoust, from GMB London, which represents about 50 TSSA staff, demands to know why the recommendations of the Kennedy report have not been implemented in full. “Among the staff, there is now an atmosphere of anxiety, hypervigilance and worry. The trust in the leadership that was burgeoning has completely collapsed and in general, staff are once again feeling demoralised, ignored, distrusted and exhausted from the pressures and strains of working in this … toxic environment,” GMB London’s regional organiser, Andrew Harden, wrote on 15 January. Harden wrote that there had been “an abject failure to follow agreed procedure and protocols regarding staff complaints made about bullying”; that the general secretary was not meeting with the staff reps every week; and that staff appointments were not following proper procedure. The Guardian first made public the allegations against Cortes in May 2022 after the union enforced a non-disclosure agreement to stop a TSSA organiser from repeating claims that she was harassed by Cortes in 2018. Cortes denied the claims and apologised for any hurt caused by his behaviour. Weeks later, other women, including the former organisers Maggie Hayes and Hannah Plant, came forward to say they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour. The Kennedy inquiry was launched in September 2022. After interviewing more than 50 former and current staff, Kennedy wrote: “It gave me no pleasure to uncover a series of appalling incidents, alongside leadership and management failings in the TSSA. “Some of this behaviour was actually witnessed – or heard – directly by me.” Managers at the union were controlling, hierarchical and bullying, she said. “The leadership seem to see staff as a problem. I have heard that people in the organisation have been described by senior staff as ‘useless cunts.’” At the annual conference in June, Cortes made a direct appeal to members to have his dismissal overturned. Having pleaded his case via video link to the conference, he made the surprising decision to take off his shirt on camera while waiting for votes to be counted. The members rejected his appeal. Eslamdoust was elected in October and previously worked for Jeremy Corbyn as a Labour party staffer. With her 12 years of experience as a councillor in north London, Eslamdoust’s election was seen as bringing in an outsider to help clear up the union’s procedures and reputation. A TSSA spokesperson said: “The union does not comment on ongoing staff matters. However, we are clear that all the recommendations made by Baroness Kennedy, and by Prof [Hazel] Conley [who published a separate report on the TSSA’s equality policy and practice in February 2023], have either been completed or are being acted on. “As we said at the time of the Kennedy report publication, TSSA is committed to implementing the widespread change needed. That remans the case.”"

        "content": "Britain needs its own ambitious green investment plan to keep up with its allies, a Labour frontbencher has said, amid an increasingly bitter row over whether Keir Starmer should stick to his £28bn pledge. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said the UK should come up with a version of Joe Biden’s $369bn (£290bn) Inflation Reduction Act, which has provided support to a range of technologies including electric cars and renewable power. Speaking from Davos, Reynolds warned that the UK risked losing business to the US if it did not commit to a significant plan of its own, even as some around the Labour leader said it would risk damaging the party in the polls. As Labour officials race to finalise the main manifesto commitments in time for its 8 February deadline, the fate of its green prosperity plan remains one of the main unanswered questions. Reynolds’s comments will bolster the arguments of those who have urged Starmer not to drop it in the face of a sustained Conservative attack. Reynolds said Biden’s act was “probably the most significant disruption to investment capital markets in 40 years – a greater impact than the pandemic and the global financial crisis … we’ve got to respond to that. We’ve got to increase our competitiveness, we’ve got to understand there’s a huge offer there from the US.” Labour officials will meet this week to discuss the £28bn promise, and further meetings are planned between shadow ministers in the coming weeks. Some in the shadow cabinet believe the policy, launched in 2021, should be ditched given that the UK faces much higher borrowing rates and Labour is desperate to avoid making unfunded spending commitments. However, others say the policy is the party’s main economic and environmental offer to voters and that dropping it will only intensify accusations that Starmer cannot be trusted to keep his promises. Like Reynolds, they make the point that the UK could lose business to the US if it fails to come up with its own version of the US act. “What’s so significant about the Inflation Reduction Act is, they have recognised that if you just do it in the cheapest way … that’s going to be Chinese,” he said. “This [the act] has been a huge disruptor, sucking away from Europe a whole range of exciting companies and technologies.” Reynolds said the precise sum mattered less than what it was being spent on. “We’ve the same view as Rachel [Reeves] and the [shadow] Treasury on this,” he added. His words echo the recommendations of a group of leading economists, who said in a paper on Monday that Britain should invest £26bn a year in the low-carbon economy rather than using the money for tax cuts. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said over the weekend the party was sticking to the policy, after a report in the Sun that it would be dropped. But he added it would not spend the full £28bn if economic circumstances did not allow it. Matt Wrack, the head of the Fire Brigades Union, told the Guardian the public would be at risk if a Labour government did not follow through on its investment promises, given the increasing number of floods and wildfires to which his members are having to respond. “If Labour doesn’t spend this money, it will put our members at risk. But it will also put communities at risk, especially in areas which are at risk of wildfires or major floods,” he said. “It will increase the strain on the fire service and the risk to firefighters.” Among those making the decision over the party’s green policies are two shadow cabinet ministers whom Starmer has asked to “bomb-proof” the manifesto so that it does not fall apart in an election campaign. The Labour leader has asked Jonathan Ashworth to see how the proposals will withstand media and opposition attacks, and Lucy Powell to check whether they will be able to form coherent legislation. Their roles mirror that played by David Miliband for Tony Blair before the 1997 election, when the young policy chief was tasked with making sure that the party had not made any promises that it could not defend from opposition criticism. If Powell and Ashworth sign off individual policies, they will be checked by Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, to see if they have been costed, before getting the final signoff from Starmer. Ravinder Athwal, the Labour leader’s policy director, is in charge of writing the manifesto. Shadow cabinet ministers have been told to have their headline policy proposals ready by 8 February, even if finer details need to be ironed out at a later date. As policy officials continue to wrangle over the fate of the £28bn green plan, Reynolds said the party remained committed to “a degree of public investment and bringing in private investment”. But he also warned against making short-term decisions that could have negative long-term consequences. “Growing up in the north-east in the 1980s, I know what getting a transition wrong looks like. This is about getting it right,” he said."

        "content": "The Conservative party has hired an overseas voter registration coordinator to mobilise thousands of supporters who live abroad to vote in target seats the party needs to win at the next general election to stay in office. The job description from party headquarters, seen by the Guardian but no longer online, said the role would focus on boosting the turnout of Tory expat voters in crucial electoral contests. It suggests the operation would coordinate UK-based proxy voters to increase Tory support in the so-called 80:20 contests. These are 80 seats, including many of those in the red wall, that the party needs to retain and 20 it wants to win. The ad, from last August, said the job included “managing the coordination of a UK-based proxy voter campaign focused on ensuring maximum turnout of Conservative supporters in key 80:20 contests”. An extra 2.2 million overseas voters who have lived abroad for more than 15 years regained the right to vote in UK elections last Tuesday, after a statutory instrument that was approved by parliament in late December almost unnoticed came into force.   Related: Low general election turnout likely with ‘dull as dishwater’ Sunak and Starmer   The expansion means they will be able to register in the constituency of the last address at which they were resident if they are able to provide relevant documentation, or failing that, through local records or on the word of an eligible British resident. They will then be able to vote by proxy, with one proxy voter able to vote on behalf of as many as four overseas voters. The Electoral Commission raised concerns in response to an earlier consultation in 2016 that voters “might be tempted to choose a marginal seat they had once lived in rather than a safe seat even if it had not been the last address they lived at before leaving”. Concerns were also raised about the difficulty of checking information and the potential for fraud. The Association of Electoral Administrators noted it would be challenging to enforce penalties for supplying false information or falsely attesting to applications from people overseas. Tory HQ has already stepped up extra support for the 80 seats, including surveys of local voters, profiling the makeup of constituencies, and money to fund campaigning and create literature such as bespoke newsletters.   Related: Mega-poll predicts disaster for Tories – but reality could be even worse   Last week’s change means British expats will now have a “vote for life”, delivering on a Tory manifesto promise, regardless of how long they have lived overseas and whether they have used any services or paid any taxes in the UK in recent years. The government has said the change represents the biggest increase of the franchise since full female suffrage in 1928. The holder of the new role also organises engagement between UK politicians and expat voters, working with sister party organisations such as the Republicans in the US and collaborating with the network of Conservatives Abroad supporters. From 1989 Britons who had lived abroad for up to 20 years were eligible to vote; then in 2001, Tony Blair’s Labour government introduced a new rule to end the right for those who had been overseas for more than 15 years. The Lib Dems stymied Tory efforts to expand the franchise again during the coalition years. The change, which brings the UK into line with countries including the US, France, Italy and New Zealand, also means that overseas residents with more tenuous links to the UK can donate to British political parties. A Tory spokesperson said: “As promised in the 2019 manifesto, the government is making it easier for British citizens living abroad to vote in parliamentary elections. Overseas voting is a mainstream democratic practice as seen in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United States.” The change in voting rights is the legacy of the late Harry Shindler, who fought a battle of almost 20 years. He challenged the 15-year rule in the high court in 2016. When successive governments failed to deliver on their manifesto promises he brought the case to the European court of justice. He remained sceptical but never gave up hope his campaign would finally bear fruit, and in March 2022 he declared his battle was “nearly over” when legislation was finally drafted. He lived to see it pass through parliament. • This article was amended on 26 January 2024. An earlier version said that all Britons who lived abroad were eligible to vote until 2001. In fact, before 1985 British citizens were unable to register to vote in UK elections if they moved abroad, unless they were service voters. From 1985 they were allowed to register as overseas voters for five years, and from 1989 to 2001 this allowance was extended to 20 years. This has been clarified. "

After the defeat, which was greeted with loud opposition cheering, the amended address in reply to the king’s speech, was carried by 328 votes to 251 – a majority of 77 (five more than for the Labour amendment now embodied in it). Mr Baldwin will tender his resignation to the king this morning after meeting the cabinet. The king will then send for Mr Ramsay MacDonald who, our political correspondent states, will take up office as premier and foreign secretary to-day. Mr Ramsay MacDonald, in a statement to the press at midnight, said:  It is not a moment for elation. It is a terrible responsibility. We shall have to do our best to face it, fail or succeed. I can only say this – that no government that was ever responsible for the affairs of this country will more honestly try to serve it. I am very proud of the Labour party and it will be a great inspiration to every working man and working woman in the country to work and to sacrifice to do their party honour and to enable it to succeed.    Related: How should Keir Starmer take on 2024? By looking back a century to Labour’s first government | Martin Kettle   Our London correspondence 22 January 1924 London, Monday nightThe event fantastically imagined and described by generations of novelists and dreamt of by enthusiasts throughout the kingdom took place quietly enough to-night, with no excited crowd round the Houses of Parliament and no great meetings in the labouring districts waiting expectantly for the tidings. The coming into power of Labour came quietly, almost apologetically, with most people asleep in bed, and even the enthusiasts disputing whether it had come at the right time and what it could do. England’s distrust of high notes is as deep as ever. “Labour between two policemen” has been one favourite picture of late of the coming government by Labour. No doubt it consoled many people. But Labour does not see it that way. A pessimistOn such an historic occasion as to-night history expects historical utterances. Here is one made to a friend to-night by a true blue Tory and Protectionist of the old school: “The awful thought is creeping over me that they may form a very efficient government.” The new premier welcomed From our parliamentary correspondent23 January 1924 Westminster, Tuesday nightIf it were permissible to apply the wardrobe style of parliamentary commentary to masculine as well as feminine attire, one might be tempted to say that the only external sign of the change of government at to-day’s brief sitting of the Commons was Mr Ramsay MacDonald’s frock-coat – a form of garment rarely seen in these days even at Westminster, except in association with an official visit to Buckingham Palace. In the old-fashioned phrase the frock-coat spoke volumes, all in terms of the privy council, the kissing of hands, the acceptance of seals, and the circulation of dispatch-boxes. Not a syllable escaped the new premier’s lips throughout the duration of the sitting, but to see him in his significant sartorial trappings, was enough. Both at his coming and his going out his followers cheered their gravely preoccupied leader to the echo. An untimely thanksgiving As soon as the preliminary business was over Mr Baldwin rose to announce that as the result of Monday night’s vote “the government have tendered their resignation to the king and his Majesty has been graciously pleased to accept.” Before, however, he could proceed with his statement the Conservative leader was checked by a sudden outburst of enthusiasm from his supporters, some of whom sprang to their feet in order to give more forcible expression to their feelings. With unimpaired self-control and speaking in his usual matter-of-fact manner, Mr Baldwin then made the announcement of the king’s acceptance of his resignation. “Thank God for that,’’ exclaimed a deep voice from the Labour benches, but despite its apparent piety the thank-offering seemed to be generally resented as equally tactless and untimely. On the whole, it must be owned, Labour behaved with remarkable decorum in its hour of triumph, refraining even from speech, apart from the solitary and inevitable exception of Mr Jack Jones.

In what other country would it have been possible for a new party representing what abroad would be called the Extreme Left in politics, a large proportion of whose most prominent men are drawn from the humblest rank of society, to enter on the direction of affairs not only without exciting any violent alarm but with the cordial goodwill of the other parties in the State?Continue reading"

        "content": "The UK’s fruit and flower growers face an “existential threat” from new post-Brexit border checks that could damage business and affect next year’s crops, the country’s biggest farming body has said. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) warned that changes to import rules in April, which will impose checks at the border for nearly all young plants coming into the country, could cause long delays and result in plants being damaged or destroyed. Martin Emmett, the NFU’s chair of the horticulture and potatoes board, said: “There is a concern that border control points can pose an existential threat to horticultural businesses in this country.”   Related: Dutch flower growers call for delays to UK post-Brexit border checks   Emmett, whose company Farplants grows about £20m of product, with just over half starting life in the EU, said: “Having unusable deliveries is what terrifies growers, and any unnecessary delays could result in stock destruction, and that ultimately impacts on businesses in the most profound way imaginable.” UK growers are reliant on the EU for young plants that start life in countries such as the Netherlands before being imported into the UK for planting. Most soft fruit plants, including strawberries and raspberries, are imported as young plants, while significant numbers of tomatoes, fruit trees and nursery plants also start life in European countries equipped with large greenhouses and better conditions. Under current rules, imported plants are held at nurseries and farms in controlled conditions before some are checked by government inspectors, with checks often prioritised based on risk. However, under new rules scheduled to come in on 30 April, the government intends to check 100% of consignments coming through the new border posts. This has led to widespread discontent among growers, who have concerns about the ability of these border posts to handle this volume of imports. They believe delays and conditions at the new posts could lead to crucial plant imports being damaged or destroyed, and threaten crops for the coming year. The Guardian has spoken to bodies that represent fruit and flower growers which have echoed the NFU’s concerns, including the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), British Apples and Pears, the British Tomato Growers’ Association and British Berry Growers (BBG). Nick Marston, the chair of BBG, said the border checks caused great concerns for the UK strawberry industry, which is heavily reliant on EU young plant imports, having brought in about 100m plants last year. He said: “We are very concerned about the government’s ability to process all those incoming plants on a timely basis, and the losses to growers that could ensue as a result of delays, which could add up to hundreds of thousands of pounds.” The HTA said it was yet to be reassured that the border posts were ready, and had serious concerns that they were planned for the spring – the peak season for the sector. The checks make up part of a new post-Brexit border regime, known as Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), which has already been delayed five times. This will require European importers to provide health certificates for “medium and high-risk” animal and plant products from 31 January, with physical inspections of these goods due to start at the end of April. Nearly all young plants are considered high risk. The government has said the border strategy was to “protect the UK against biosecurity threats”, and the new controls would use “Brexit freedoms to simplify import controls on goods from across the globe”. Growers groups said that while they were supportive of the government’s biosecurity aims, some were unconvinced that the posts, which could involve different plants unloaded in depots side-by-side, would achieve this aim. Robert James, the co-chair of the Tomato Growers’ Association technical committee, said the border posts lacked the same controlled conditions seen on farms. James said: “We’re introducing a really significant point of infection, or introduction of pests, which could put growers’ crops at massive financial risk of crop failure.” Last month, Dutch flower sellers called for delays to the checks, warning it was worried its products could suffer “substantial damages and losses” at the border. The new border control posts have been established near some of the UK’s biggest ports, including a new major border post at Sevington, about 20 miles from Dover. The government is hoping to trial a system where growers can become de facto border posts, but these require large amounts of investment from companies. The NFU is calling for the government to allow plants to bypass these posts with “place of destination” checks, while adopting a more risk-based approach to reduce the number of checks. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “We have introduced these new import controls in phases to support businesses and ensure efficient trade of plants is maintained between the EU and Great Britain. “The current ‘places of destination’ scheme was always designed to be a temporary measure until inspections commenced at border control posts. “The controls that the new model introduces play a vital role in keeping the UK safe, protecting our food supply chains and farming sector from damaging disease outbreaks.”"

        "content": "Nigel Farage privately lobbied a senior Tory treasury minister for help with his de-banking complaint against NatWest, asking him for advice “before I go public”. WhatsApp messages shared with the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show the former Brexit party leader contacted Andrew Griffith, then economic secretary to the Treasury, to discuss allegations that Coutts, NatWest’s private bank subsidiary, had closed his accounts because of his politics.  A message sent by Farage shortly before 1am on 28 April 2023 said: “Thanks for making contact. Yes, a chat would be useful”. A further message sent just before noon the same day read: “Dear Andrew, when you have 5 minutes do let me know.” Twelve days later Farage got in touch again, saying: “Be keen to discuss my legal position with you before I go public on this.” The Treasury confirmed that a telephone conversation between Farage and Griffith later took place with a civil servant present. No messages from Griffith are shown in screenshots of the exchange provided by the Treasury. He appears to have been using WhatsApp’s disappearing messages function. Griffith went on to play a key role in the ensuing row, summoning the bosses of the UK’s biggest banks to a meeting and raising concerns over the protection of free speech. The row led to the resignation of NatWest’s chief executive Alison Rose after she admitted discussing Farage’s relationship with the bank with a senior BBC journalist, and of Peter Flavel, the Coutts CEO. The financial regulator later found no evidence that banks had shut customers’ accounts primarily because of their political beliefs. Lawyers behind an independent review for NatWest also determined that Coutts had a “contractual right” to shut Farage’s accounts, and did so because the bank was losing money by keeping him as a client. They identified “serious failings”, but added that it had not discriminated against him. The disclosure will raise questions about the extent to which senior Tories worked with the GB News presenter before he launched his public complaint against NatWest. Griffith’s use of the disappearing messages function will also add to concerns about ministers avoiding scrutiny by using the app. Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, accused Farage and Griffith of secretly plotting together before the launch of the former Ukip leader’s campaign. “No one who has been following British politics for the last three decades will be remotely surprised to see this Tory government secretly conspiring behind the scenes with Nigel Farage to support each other’s campaigns and attacks,” she said. The Treasury admitted earlier this year that Griffith and Farage had been in contact. Farage has told the Guardian that Griffith’s role in holding banks to account had been “outstanding” and that every MP was aware of constituents whose businesses had been destroyed. “I reached out to him to say I had a major problem. On a confidential basis I just informed him of the problems I was having, because I couldn’t get a bank account anywhere,” he said. Griffith, who is now a science minister, said: “The FoI disclosure shows faithfully what happened which is that I was made aware that Mr Farage had a banking issue, I called him in the presence of my private secretary, a note of that conversation was quite correctly recorded for the files and that has been disclosed upon the Guardian’s request.” Griffith said he had previously been aware of similar issues faced by Toby Young of the Free Speech Union. “I took the problem of de-banking incredibly seriously during my tenure as economic secretary and I am proud of the decisive action which we have taken as a government,” he said. John Edwards, the information commissioner, told ministers last year that they could face criminal sanctions for deleting their WhatsApp messages in some circumstances. The government also published new rules on using WhatsApp at the end of March, which stated that the use of disappearing messages must not affect “record keeping or transparency responsibilities”. A Treasury spokesperson said Griffith had followed the correct processes. “Guidelines state that disappearing message functions have a role in preventing the buildup of messages on devices,” they said. “In this instance correct record keeping processes were followed and a call was made in the presence of a civil servant, which was recorded and filed, and has been disclosed as part of the freedom of information request.” In the wake of the Farage de-banking scandal, some charities, churches and other community groups have described being thrown into financial disarray after Barclays shut or froze their bank accounts without warning. Few if any of them appear to have had had a direct line to a government minister."

        "content": "Keir Starmer will defend organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the National Trust on Monday, accusing the Conservatives of attacking them to stoke a “desperate” culture war. The Labour leader will mount a forceful defence of the institutions during a speech to a civil society summit on Monday in his most outspoken response to Conservative criticisms of “woke” politics. “The Tories seem set on sabotaging civil society to save their own skins,” Starmer will say. “They got themselves so tangled up in culture wars of their own making, that instead of working with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution – an organisation the late queen was patron of for 70 years – to find real solutions to stop the small boats, their rhetoric has helped demonise them. “Instead of working with the National Trust so more people can learn about – and celebrate – our culture and our history, they’ve managed to demean their work. In its desperation to cling on to power, at all costs, the Tory party is trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect.” The RNLI and National Trust have found themselves the unlikely targets of Conservative attacks in recent years, with Tory MPs accusing them of pursuing politically correct policies. In 2019, the RNLI was criticised by Conservative backbenchers for spending money on anti-drowning charities abroad. It then came under fire in 2021 from Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who accused the institute of acting as a “taxi service for illegal immigration” because of its work helping distressed asylum seekers in the Channel. The National Trust, Britain’s largest charity, has been embroiled in a battle over its stance towards rewilding Britain’s countryside and how to depict the links between the properties it oversees and the UK’s colonial legacy. In 2022 a group headed by a Conservative donor and including two “anti-woke” historians launched an attempt to gain control of the charity, while the Tory MP Andrew Murrison set up a parliamentary group to “scrutinise” its work. Starmer will on Monday accuse the Conservatives of targeting the institutions to shore up the party’s weak poll position. “Let me tell you, waging a war on the proud spirit of service in this country isn’t leadership,” he will say. “It’s desperate. It’s divisive. It’s damaging. It comes to something when the Tories are at war with the National Trust. That’s what happens when politics of self-preservation prevail over commitment to service.” In comments that echo David Cameron’s vision of the “big society”, he will also urge charities, community leaders and faith groups to play an active role in Britain’s public life. “Cameron talked about the big society, but when austerity kicked in, we ended up with the poor society,” he will say. “Now we need a new vision for a new era. A renewed social contract. A new focus on those who build the bonds that connect us, the communities that nurture us, the institutions that support families and provide a bridge between the state and the market: a society of service.” • This article was amended on 22 January 2024 to clarify text about the nature of the issues recently faced by the National Trust."

        "content": "A cross-party trio of politicians from Muslim and Palestinian backgrounds have jointly urged Britons to use this month’s Holocaust Memorial Day as a moment for community cohesion and not to allow differences over the war in Gaza to inflame tensions. In a letter to the Guardian, Sayeeda Warsi, the Conservative peer and former party chair, the Labour MP Naz Shah and Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat who is the only British MP of Palestinian heritage, said Holocaust Memorial Day was “a moment to remember the systematic slaughter of 6 million Jewish people for no reason other than who they were”. The trio wrote: “It’s undoubtedly true that the horrific violence we are seeing is heightening tensions, but the reality is this conflict is amplifying unaddressed issues of hate in our society. “It is not concern for Jewish safety in Israel that compels someone to dump a pig’s head at a proposed mosque site, or a desire to express solidarity with the Palestinian people that makes someone scrawl swastikas on bridges. Both are motivated by hatred we can grow here at home.”   Related: Remembering the horror of the Holocaust | Letter   The letter, arranged in association with Brendan Cox, the widower of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox and a campaigner for community togetherness, warned that the war in Gaza, following the 7 October massacre by Hamas, “is dividing lots of communities”. Moran has been vocal in her support for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and has spoken repeatedly about the plight of relatives trapped there. Warsi has condemned Islamophobia within her party, while Shah made a heartfelt apology in 2016 for social media comments she made about Israel that were seen as antisemitic. They wrote: “As politicians from three different parties we come together to remind our country that the rising tide of hatred we have seen in recent months makes it more important than ever that we take this moment on 27 January to remember the inevitable outcome of indulging hatred and staying silent when others are persecuted for who they are.” Cox told the Guardian that the letter sought to address the risk that Holocaust Memorial Day could be “misused by people who want to drive division rather than connection”. He added: “To do this across political lines of difference is a really clear and strong statement about using this to come together rather than to divide.” Holocaust Memorial Day is on Saturday 27 January in the UK."

        "content": "The chair of the foreign affairs select committee is writing to the foreign secretary, David Cameron, asking him to clarify his claim that he had not taken any formal decision to allow arms sales to Israel to continue amid the Gaza crisis. Written evidence presented by the UK Department for Business and Trade shows the foreign secretary on 8 December recommended arms sales licences be allowed to continue when presented with three options: stopping arms sales, pausing them, or allowing them to continue. Foreign Office officials, in papers sent by the foreign secretary, had expressed serious concerns about aspects of the Israeli assault against Hamas. They also said the Foreign Office did not agree with Israeli claims that it did not have a legal duty to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, but only to allow others to provide aid, and that this permission could be conditional. The business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on 18 December concurred with Lord Cameron’s recommendation that Israel was not in breach of international humanitarian law (IHL) and the arms exports could continue. At an evidence session on 9 January, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Alicia Kearns, along with other committee members, repeatedly pressed Cameron on whether arms export licences should be stopped on grounds that IHL was being breached by Israel. The Italian foreign minister at the weekend confirmed Italy blocked all arms exports to Israel as soon as the attacks in Gaza started. Although Cameron admitted to committee members that he had worries about aspects of the Israeli military campaign, and that advice had been given to him on a rolling basis by officials, he did not disclose – despite twice being asked by the committee chair – whether a formal review took place. Cameron also said he acted only on the advice of officials, not suggesting he himself made a ministerial decision when faced with options. He said: “My job is not to make a legal adjudication. I am not a lawyer.” He also initially refused to tell MPs when asked if he had ever received advice saying Israel was in breach of IHL. He later added: “The legal advice I have received is consistent with the fact that we have not changed our export procedures.” Kearns, a Conservative MP, is writing to the Foreign Office to seek clarification of the decision-making process and to ask whether any of the evidence given needs revision. The Foreign Office’s internal discussions were revealed in a business department court affidavit including partial extracts from aspects of Foreign Office official papers sent to ministers. These were presented to the high court in a claim for a judicial review of the continuance of arms sales that has been lodged by Global Legal Action Network, an NGO. To fend off the case, the department is required to show the courts its decision-making process was fair and rational. The papers show the Export Control Joint Unit launched “a change in circumstances review” in view of Israel’s military campaign inside Gaza, and a parallel review took place in the Ministry of Defence that concluded on 27 November. The Foreign Office papers said: “Given the paucity of information, the scale and intensity of the conflict, the death toll, the unusual civilian population density coupled with their inability to evacuate and the concomitance mounting effects of the conflict on civilians, [the government’s] current inability to come to a clear assessment on Israel’s record of compliance with IHL poses significant policy risks.” The Foreign Office then sought and received written assurances from the Israeli embassy, but still wrote to Cameron on 8 December saying it was for him to decide if there was a commitment to comply with IHL.  The paper set out the options and said “that the availability of each of the options turned on the foreign secretary’s assessment of whether there is a clear risk that items would be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of IHL”. On 12 December, the court document says Cameron “decided that he was satisfied that there was good evidence to support a judgment that Israel is committed to comply with IHL. On the basis of that assessment in particular, the foreign secretary decided to recommend option 1 to the secretary of state for business and trade.” During his evidence session, the foreign secretary admitted internal discussions had taken place. He said: “What I have to do is act on the advice that I am given. That advice is based on what we believe is happening, so we ask a whole series of questions of the Israeli government about individual actions that are brought to our attention.  “We receive advice on that, consider that advice, and then pass it on to the department of trade for them to make the decision on arms exports.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-21T14:23:32+00:00",
        "content": "Gordon Brown has urged Jeremy Hunt to act on startling new research into Britain’s threadbare benefits system that showed that the poorest families must spend an average of 63p in each pound to meet basic food and energy needs. The former prime minister said the paper was a “wake-up call” to the chancellor that “reveals the arithmetic of poverty”, and forces the UK to “face up to the fact that it is in the throes of a crisis”. The study highlights how a couple on benefits with two children must spend nearly 50% more of their income on food and energy than they did in 2012, when the figure was 46p.  This is due to the precipitous fall in real-terms value of benefits. The equivalent spend by the average UK family is roughly 20p in each pound earned, the report says. Brown said the chancellor should use his budget on 6 March to “implement a root-and-branch reform of the benefits system” in order to stymie further impoverishment of Britain’s poorest children. On Thursday Hunt gave his heaviest hint yet that he plans a big tax giveaway at his next budget in the run-up to this year’s general election. He was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, an annual meeting at a Swiss ski resort frequented by billionaires and politicians. The unpublished briefing paper by Prof Donald Hirsch, titled the UK’s Inadequate and Unfair Safety Net, concludes that Britain’s benefit system no longer provides the basic amount needed “to function day to day and have healthy lives”. He added that the need to balance competing basic costs – such as clothes, toiletries and transport – meant spending on food and energy by the poorest households was likely to be inadequate, leading to serious health consequences for families. Even if they cut back on basic items, other essentials would be unaffordable, the Financial Fairness Trust study concluded. The gap is even more stark for single adults on benefits. In 2012, minimum basic food and energy costs ate up 73% of their weekly income, whereas in 2023 those costs amounted to 22% more than their benefits provided, leaving them unable to afford to eat properly, let alone meet clothing, toiletries and transport costs. Hirsch wrote: “The level of working-age benefits in the UK today is denying claimants access to the most fundamental material resources needed to function day to day and have healthy lives.” He added: “The UK benefits system has always had its shortcomings, with benefit rates that are not related to evidence of need, serious obstacles and delays in administration and some people falling through the net of income protection that it seeks to provide. “But today, all these features have become so pervasive that benefits are falling woefully and systematically short of protecting citizens against hard times.” Speaking to the Guardian, Brown said: “Britain needs to face up to the fact that it is in the throes of a poverty crisis. Donald Hirsch’s important and path-breaking research reveals the arithmetic of poverty, showing just why so many families on benefits can no longer make ends meet. “It is an evidence-based wake-up call to the chancellor to use his March budget to implement a root-and-branch reform of the benefits system.” The research into the inadequacy of the benefits system comes amid an alarming growth in households facing deep levels of poverty. More than 1 million children experienced destitution in the UK last year, meaning their families could not afford to adequately feed, clothe or clean them, or keep them warm. Working-age benefits have fallen to 13% below their 2009 peak, their real-terms value falling most dramatically when the government froze benefit levels between 2016 and 2019. But this has been exacerbated by holes designed into the safety net that mean most claimants now receive even less money than their entitlement. These include the bedroom tax, the two-child limit and the benefit cap, and deductions used to pay back loan advances made to universal credit claimants waiting five weeks for a first benefit payment. “These holes in the safety net are so gaping that receiving a full entitlement has become the exception rather than the rule,” writes Hirsch. He called for an overhaul of the current system to ensure it provided a “fair and reliable” safety net, by setting up a government taskforce along the lines of the 2005 Turner commission, which established the principle that pensions would rise at least in line with earnings. Hirsch calculated the costs of food by adapting publicly agreed minimum income standards that agree how much is needed to afford a modest, nutritionally adequate diet. His calculations do not include alcohol or eating out. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Hunt again signalled that he was keen on tax cuts in the next budget, comparing himself to the former tax-cutting chancellor Nigel Lawson. Hunt said: “Just as Nigel Lawson positioned the City of London for the finance boom in the 1980s, this period of Conservative government has seen the UK positioned for the massive technological boom we’re set to see in the coming years.” Speaking at Davos on Thursday, he said: “In terms of the direction of travel, we look around the world and we note that the economies growing faster than us in North America and Asia tend to have lower taxes, and I believe fundamentally that low-tax economies are more dynamic, more competitive and generate more money for public services like the NHS. “That’s the direction of travel we would like to go in, but it is too early to say what we are going to do.”  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “The best thing we can do to help those who are struggling is put money back in people’s pockets. That’s why we’ve cut taxes and brought inflation down by more than half while providing support to those who need it most. “We continue to help families with cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% in April.” New research by Age UK released on Monday has found that almost everyone aged over 50 is worried about the cost of living. While a quarter said the cost of living was affecting them severely or very severely, this rose to nearly half (46%) of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic populations and more than a third of those aged 50-59, those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, people with long-term conditions and unpaid carers. Nearly one in five over-50s, equivalent to 4.8 million people, said they were worried they would not be able to eat enough this winter. Around one in five people over 50 are already skipping meals, while three in four over-50s have been turning down their heating or reducing how long they keep it on for. As a result, 9% said their health had suffered. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: “Whether it’s pensioners struggling to pay their bills on their fixed low incomes, or people in their 50s in poorly paid jobs, or out of the labour market altogether due to ill health, caring responsibilities or unemployment, anxiety about making ends meet and getting through this winter is incredibly widespread.” Additional reporting by Anna Bawden"

        "content": "The public will be put at risk if Keir Starmer drops his plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment, according to the head of the Fire Brigades Union, who warned that his members were already witnessing the effects of the climate crisis. Matt Wrack, the FBU’s general secretary, urged the Labour leader not to scale back or delay the party’s green scheme, which he said was essential for combating a steep increase in floods, wildfires and storms. Wrack called on Starmer to include mitigation measures such as flood defences in the plan as well as more long-term investment aimed at cutting carbon emissions. His intervention comes at the beginning of a key week for the future of the plan in which officials are to meet to debate whether it should go ahead. Wrack said: “If Labour doesn’t spend this money, it will put our members at risk, but it will also put communities at risk, especially in areas which are at risk of wildfires or major floods. It will increase the strain on the fire service and the risk to firefighters.”  Interactive  Firefighters have been dealing with rapidly rising numbers of floods and wildfires in recent years, which scientists say is a direct result of climate breakdown. In 2018 there were 65 wildfire incidents in Britain, according to the National Fire Chiefs Council. Three years later that had more than doubled to 178. Government data shows that flooding incidents in England have increased by nearly a quarter in the last decade. Wrack said his members were struggling to cope with the increase in extreme weather events, and that people were being put at risk as a result. Heavy rains from Storm Henk flooded about 2,000 homes earlier this year as a month’s worth of rainfell in just four days in some parts of the UK. “We are potentially leaving people in a dangerous and vulnerable position, for example with no power in their homes or stranded on the upper floor of a house when the ground floor is flooded,” he said. The government plans to spend just over £220m on flood defences this year, but Wrack wants Labour to use its green prosperity plan to increase that figure.  Interactive  “Part of the scheme needs to be about emergency planning and preparation,” he said. “We think the fire service can play a central role in that.” Starmer has said in recent weeks that he remains committed to the policy of spending £28bn on environmental investments by the second half of the parliament, though the figure will be limited by how much Labour can borrow while sticking to its strict fiscal rules. The party has promised to borrow only as much as it can while still being able to forecast that debt will start falling as a share of economic output in five years’ time. The Labour leader also used a meeting with union leaders last week to reassure them of his commitment to the scheme. However, Labour sources say Starmer and his allies are still willing to drop the policy before the election if they decide it is too much of a liability in an election campaign. The Conservatives are preparing to feature the Labour pledge heavily in their campaign material, arguing that it can be funded only by higher borrowing or more tax rises."

        "content": "Most MPs across Westminster fear the use of deepfakes and AI-generated content will undermine the integrity of the next general election, amid demands for an urgent overhaul of their regulation ahead of polling day. Ministers are already concerned about the effect the technology has had on elections overseas, with a survey of MPs revealing that a majority believe it poses a threat to the integrity of the coming election. Some 70% fear AI will increase the spread of misinformation and disinformation. With 2024 billed as a huge year for democracy with elections taking place around the world, senior figures from all major parties are pushing for the issue to be prioritised before the election campaign takes off in earnest. All parties are being urged to promise not to amplify material they cannot verify. Both London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Keir Starmer have already been targeted by deepfake attempts in recent months, with invented audio clips designed to damage them. Meanwhile, security minister Tom Tugendhat has warned that deepfakes have already been attempted in the run-up to the Slovakian elections. Last week, chancellor Jeremy Hunt warned that the development of AI had to be in line with “liberal democratic values”. A survey of MPs seen by the Observer shows that 57% of those asked said AI could negatively interfere with electoral integrity in 2024. Two-thirds (65%) said political parties and politicians should be transparent about how they are using AI tools in campaigns, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by the communications consultancy Cavendish. The vast majority of general voters – some 78% – backed a requirement for political parties to disclose their use of AI. The findings are included in a forthcoming report by the Demos thinktank, which calls for all parties to sign up to new standards on the use of AI and to publish their internal guidelines for using it. Researchers also call on parties to commit to not amplifying suspect material. Robert Buckland, the former Tory justice secretary, said action was needed ahead of “the biggest year of elections in world history”. He added: “We have to make sure that the clear and present danger to democracy presented by deepfakes and AI generated misinformation is both headed off and mitigated by direct action.” Khan told the Observer that the far right had sought to use the material against him to “raise tensions, sow hatred and turn communities against each other”. He urged ministers to heed a call from the Electoral Commission to update laws on disinformation. “This trend is only likely to get worse in the weeks and months to come in the lead-up to the London mayoral and general elections later this year,” he said. “The danger this new and unregulated technology poses to our politics and democratic freedoms, as well as wider society, can’t be overstated. “I also urge the tech industry, the police and the wider criminal justice system to work together and provide researchers with the data they need to identify and examine the changing risks and challenges of this harmful content.” Peter Kyle, the shadow science and technology minister, said the technology could have “potentially devastating consequences and can further erode trust in institutions”. He added: “A Labour government would urgently introduce binding regulation of the small group of companies developing the most powerful AI models that could, if left unchecked, spread misinformation, undermine elections and help terrorists build weapons.” Polly Curtis, chief executive at Demos, urged all parties “to come together to agree on a way forward to protect the democratic systems they hold so dear and establish responsible norms about how generative AI is used”. In addition to the potential of fake content, some Tories have also been warning of the dangers of misrepresenting real material after an encounter with Rishi Sunak and a former NHS worker last week. Sky News tweeted a video showing the voter berating Sunak about the state of the NHS. Sunak is then shown laughing and walking off. After dozens of Labour MPs and commentators criticised Sunak, Sky News broadcast full footage of the encounter which showed the pair had walked off together before ending their encounter by shaking hands. A Downing Street source said Sunak was laughing at a comment from someone in the crowd, rather than the woman. A Department for Science Innovation and Technology spokesperson said: “We are working to ensure we are ready to respond to threats to our democratic processes, including through our Defending Democracy Taskforce. “The Online Safety Act will soon make social media platforms legally responsible for removing illegal mis- and disinformation and enforcing their terms of service. We have also introduced the Digital Imprints Regime, which requires certain political campaigning digital material, including AI-generated material, to have a digital imprint that makes clear to voters who is promoting the content.”"

        "content": "From the devastating to the downright desperate, the Conservatives have a rich – if chequered – history of devising political attack advertisements designed to see off Labour. At their best, they have the power to tap into the nation’s doubts about the party, most obviously preying on suspicions that it will tax and spend the moment it seizes the levers of power. They have also attempted to take aim at the perceived flaws of the Labour leader – whether it was concerns over Jeremy Corbyn’s views on national security or Ed Miliband’s willingness to stand up to the SNP should he become prime minister. With Labour still retaining a stubbornly large poll lead in an election year, the Tories are now engaged in an increasingly desperate race to find an attack on Keir Starmer and his party that might stick. While Boris Johnson’s depiction of Starmer as “Captain Hindsight” during the peak of the Covid crisis gained some traction, the Tories have since veered from depicting Starmer as ruthless and unprincipled to being a lefty lawyer committed to human rights. Here, we document the party’s most and least successful attempts to land one on their opponents. Life’s better with the Conservatives. Don’t let Labour ruin it, 1959 Building on prime minister Harold Macmillan’s 1957 declaration that the UK had “never had it so good”, the Tories carried the message into their election campaign. The country agreed and gave the party a historic third general election victory in a row, increasing its majority from 60 to 100 seats. Labour isn’t working, 1979 Widely regarded as the epitome of the successful attack ad, Saatchi & Saatchi’s “Labour isn’t working” poster used in Margaret Thatcher’s victorious 1979 campaign managed to highlight the nation’s concerns in one image of a winding dole queue. The simple idea also spoke to Thatcher’s iconoclastic approach to taking a different path. Attack ads had well and truly arrived. Labour’s tax bombshell, 1992 Another Saatchi ad that highlighted concerns felt by voters over the prospect of installing Neil Kinnock into No 10 in 1992. Kinnock had taken Labour back towards the centre after it had drifted to the left under Michael Foot -, yet suspicions remained over its economic plans. The defeat fuelled a future New Labour’s obsession with having credible spending plans. New Labour, New Danger, 1996 The image of Tony Blair with demon eyes has come to symbolise the attack ad gone wrong. It was published with the Tories desperate to dent a huge Labour lead and tried to paint New Labour as being old Labour in disguise. The problem was that voters disagreed – as shown by Labour’s 179-strong majority in 1997. In the pocket of the SNP (main picture, above), 2015 With polls suggesting Labour could be the biggest party in a hung parliament after the 2015 election, a Tory party running out of ideas published an ad depicting Labour’s Ed Miliband as being in the pocket of the SNP’s Alex Salmond. The idea took off thanks to English voters’ perception of Miliband as weak. Better Call Keir, 2024 With Labour’s poll lead still in double digits, the Tories are attacking Keir Starmer for cases he took on as a criminal barrister – with a reference to the hit television show Better Call Saul. Social media users soon pointed out that, quite apart from the fact that Starmer had prosecuted terrorists, the poster made the Labour leader look almost cool."

        "content": "‘Getting showbiz personalities out of the political closet is rarely easy,’ the Observer commented on 5 May 1991, exploring the awkward relationship between politics and celebrity. It managed to out a few: Gyles Brandreth and Glenda Jackson were standing for election; John Major with his music-hall heritage was PM, and there was a new, albeit muted, hint of glamour to British political life.   Tories admitted Margaret Thatcher had not helped seduce creatives: ‘She’s read one book, a Frederick Forsyth thriller’   The ideological battle lines were clear. ‘Thespians and alternative comedians go for Labour,’ the article declared, with Kinnock-supporting quotes from Ben Elton, Lenny Henry and Prunella Scales. Meanwhile, ‘Sports stars and light entertainment comedians of the old school support the Tories.’ ‘Majorettes’ included Bob Monkhouse, Kenny Everett – and Steve Davis, joking about ‘potting reds’. A Tory spokesperson admitted Thatcher had not helped seduce creatives to the Tory cause: ‘She’s read one book, a Frederick Forsyth thriller, and you’d have thought its interest would wane after six readings.’ There were a few true blue exceptions: William Roache, proudly pictured outside the Rovers Return with Mrs T, and Bill Wyman fretting about 98% tax: ‘I lean politically towards what is best for me.’ On the stump with Brandreth in Chester, TV fame and funny jumpers were seen as a drawback, not an advantage, by local Tories even though he was ‘as wholesome and family oriented as say, a portion of chicken nuggets’. Jackson, meanwhile, deployed ‘resigned contempt or derisive laughter’ when asked if her celebrity impressed voters, declaring: ‘It’s not a popularity contest.’ Would either relish the pantomime drama of parliament if elected? Actor and Labour MP Andrew Faulds (formerly ‘Captain Jet Morgan, hero of Journey into Space’) said: ‘The only benefit to having been an actor is that you know how to phrase and wait for a laugh.’ Andrew Rawnsley, still of this parish, had doubts: ‘When Glenda Jackson is stuck in a debate at 2am addressing two other MPs and a Hansard reporter, she’s going to find it all very different from the RSC.’ Jackson’s 23 subsequent years in parliament suggest she didn’t mind at all."

        "content": "After yet another disaster of a week for Rishi Sunak and the Tory party, disillusioned Conservative MPs returned to all corners of the UK on Thursday and Friday to hear the verdicts of voters. Days of internal chaos and division over the government’s Rwanda deportations legislation had left the impression of a party in irreversible decline. The sense in the House of Commons had been one of fast advancing and predictable decay bordering at times on farce, rather than great drama. But was there still some residual hope for Conservatives, to be found out there, in the country? Martin Vickers, the veteran Tory MP for Cleethorpes, spent much of Friday morning, after the bruising events in the Commons, chatting to his constituents in a supermarket in Barton-upon-Humber, most of whom he judged to be still “instinctively Conservative voters”. Vickers, a grandee who sits on the executive of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, is by nature an optimist, and a loyalist. “I would say all is not completely lost,” was his considered assessment afterwards. “It is certainly the case that people are disillusioned,” he conceded. “But these people don’t want Starmer. I think quite a few of them will just stay at home, but some will think ‘better the devil you know’ and stay with us. It is my job to motivate those people. There is a path to victory, but it is a very narrow one.”   Maybe I am delusional but it doesn’t feel to me like 1997 at the moment  John Stevenson MP    On the other side of the country in Carlisle, the city’s Tory MP, John Stevenson, had been having similar conversations with his constituents. Conservative MPs these days have trained themselves to look out for positives. He, like his colleague Vickers, concluded that there was indeed a “very narrow path” to success, one along which everything had to go absolutely right for the government, all the way up to polling day. “Three things have to happen,” said Stevenson, who chairs the Northern Research Group of “red wall” Tory MPs. “First, we must stop squabbling, and find a degree of unity. Second, the economy must turn, which I think it will. And third, we have to expose the lack of plans, ideas, and vision in the Labour party. As we get closer to an election people are going to say to Keir Starmer, ‘Hey, you look like you could be prime minister. What do you actually believe in?’ Maybe I am delusional but it doesn’t feel to me like 1996, or 97 at the moment.” Elsewhere, however, as the week wore on and with apocalyptic opinion polls for the Tories appearing one after another, there was a growing sense at home and abroad that a Labour government was around the corner. On Tuesday, as Sunak and his chancellor Jeremy Hunt were preoccupied rallying Conservative MPs behind the Rwanda deportation scheme, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos. There she found herself in huge demand as she held bilateral meetings with finance ministers, business leaders and economists, interspersed with impromptu get-togethers with those just wanting to get on her radar. One of those who travelled with Reeves said: “Everywhere she went people wanted to see her, talk to her. They were saying ‘good luck’, ‘we hope to see you next year’, people wanted selfies with her, to exchange cards. They were saying it is so great to see you, and it’s such a shame that the UK prime minister and chancellor are not here.’” Hunt eventually turned up on Thursday after most business leaders and people from other governments had left, only to be asked by UK journalists how it felt that his Labour counterpart Reeves had been feted in his absence, and was now regarded the world over as the chancellor in waiting. Unhelpfully, former Tory chancellor George Osborne said from Davos, on his Political Currency podcast with Ed Balls, that “it really feels like here at this global gathering, it’s the Labour party rather than the Conservatives who have been kind of grabbing the microphone for Britain”. By Wednesday evening, back in the Commons, Sunak had seen off the Tory rebellion, and his controversial Rwanda legislation headed for more problems in the House of Lords. Only 11 Tory backbenchers voted to actually kill off the bill, among them former cabinet ministers and likely future leadership contenders Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick, but more than 60 backbench Tories had supported amendments to alter it. If ever there had been a pyrrhic victory it was this: the painful progress of the Rwanda bill through the Commons had merely exposed, yet again, the very ill-discipline and disunity that Stevenson and others say it is now so essential to avoid.   People ask where the big ideas are. They will come … For now we just watch the Tories implode  Labour peer    In the Commons chamber there were surreal scenes as rightwingers demanded that the UK should in effect ignore international law to get flights to Rwanda off the ground, while senior Tories on the other wing of the party gently mocked the legislation and the contradictions in the government’s approach to current international crises that it highlighted. The most devastating contribution came from former attorney general Jeremy Wright, who said the government’s assertion that it could be the judge of whether Rwanda was a safe country to which to deport asylum seekers was legally and intellectually problematic to say the least. “As I say, there is a good practical reason why we should be nervous about this: because we do sometimes rely on international law to discharge our own policy intents and purposes,” he told MPs. “Not more than 48 hours ago in this place, we were doing exactly that. We were saying that it is important to criticise the actions of the Houthis in the Red Sea because they contravene principles of international law. We were saying too that we justify our own response to that because it is in accordance with the principles of international law, and quite right, too.” Wright added that such a position “runs the risk of, first, other states finding comfort in our example and, secondly, undermining our own messages in other situations. That makes this not just bad law, but bad foreign policy.” While Sunak was expending so much political energy on the symbolic objective of getting flights to Rwanda airborne by the spring, even the Rwandans were having doubts about whether they would happen and whether it was all a good idea after all. Asked by the Guardian in Davos about the plans, Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, expressed frustration, saying: “There are limits for how long this can drag on.” Kagame added that it was “the UK’s problem, not Rwanda’s problem”. When it came to the final vote on Wednesday evening, the main reason the prime minister avoided defeat on the bill as a whole, was not that his MPs approved of it, but that they decided to step back from committing political suicide. In the Commons corridors Jenrick was parading himself – with an eye on the future – insisting he would vote against. But a former Tory cabinet minister and veteran of Maastricht rebellions in the 1990s, who had voted for several rebel amendments, articulated the view of many that to do so en masse would be terminal for the party and for individual MPs’ chances of surviving at the next election. “I have done my bit [voting for amendments] but I can’t bring the whole house down over this. We know if we did what the consequences would be. Disaster. It is not great [the bill] but we have made our point. If this is what they want to do, it is their problem, not ours.” It was hardly a vote of confidence in Sunak: rather a vote to avoid facing the wrath of the electorate and the risk of losing their seats before they had to. Only a few weeks ago, in both the Labour and Tory parties, there had been a strong, though minority, view that Rishi Sunak might go for a general election in early May, off the back of a tax-cutting budget in March. The idea was that he could control the agenda, surprise Labour with tax cuts, and catch Starmer’s party off guard. Last week’s events, including a surprise rise in inflation, and opinion polls predicting a Labour landslide, make that early election ever more unlikely. Starmer and his troops appear and sound increasingly confident. Last week Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s head of campaigns, was busy briefing senior figures across the party about the way ahead and the need to stay disciplined, united and avoid mistakes. “People ask where the big ideas are. They will come,” said one Labour peer. “But the operation is brilliant, the most professional I have known. It is about winning. For now we just watch the Tories implode.”   Related: ‘I don’t think they’re bothered about people up here’: voters in Lee Anderson’s Ashfield turning their back on all politicians   The task for the Tories now is to try to rediscover some reason for hope. Only a handful of his MPs want Sunak out of Downing Street – so on that score he can rest easy. But ominously there are more rather than fewer obstacles appearing on what his MPs describe as that “narrow road” to recovery. The party faces three byelections in the next few weeks, all of which it could lose. The Rwanda legislation will hit turbulence in the Lords from Monday. Its legislation on awarding annual oil and gas licences for the North Sea, which has enraged green Tories, is in the Commons next week. Then there are local elections in May at which the Conservatives face another mauling. Tory strategists say their own private polling indicates there are an unusually high number of “don’t knows” showing up in their data and that a lot of these are former Conservative voting women. “It is a question of how many of those come back to us as to whether it is a small Labour majority, or a very big Labour majority indeed,” said one senior Tory insider. Increasingly, Conservatives are pinning their fading hopes of recovery on tax cuts. In Davos, Hunt suggested again that he would act in the budget in early March to put more money back in people’s pockets. Having already cut national insurance and with the prospect of more tax cutting in the autumn before an election, the chancellor hopes he can create a story of economic success and a year of tax reductions, over three successive “fiscal events”. One senior backbencher said: “We know we are going to get tax cuts and they will be important. The big question, however, is after everything else whether the public will give us any credit for them.”"

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has compared himself to former tax-cutting chancellor Nigel Lawson, as he joined Rishi Sunak in teasing further potential cuts in the spring budget. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the chancellor drew comparisons with the late Lawson, who was known for slashing personal taxation while serving in the Thatcher government. Hunt said: “Just as Nigel Lawson positioned the City of London for the finance boom in the 1980s, this period of Conservative government has seen the UK positioned for the massive technological boom we’re set to see in the coming years.” Lawson was appointed chancellor of the exchequer in 1983, delivering six budgets until his resignation in 1989. He began a tax-cutting process in 1986 that intended to cut the basic rate of income tax, initially from 30% to 29%. Two years later, the rate was cut to 25%. Hunt’s commitment to cutting taxes has been echoed by the prime minister, who promised to “always prioritise tax cuts to put more of people’s money back in their pockets”. Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Sunak said the government had been able to introduce a reduction in national insurance contributions because his party had run the economy in a “disciplined way”. Hunt announced in November that the main rate of national insurance would be reduced from 12% to 10%, in a move the Treasury said represents “the largest ever cut to national insurance”. The policy took effect from 6 January, meaning 27 million workers should soon see an uplift. While heralded as a win, personal income tax thresholds remaining frozen until 2028 leave lingering doubts as to how beneficial this policy will be. Hunt has faced pressure to take action against this fiscal drag, but has so far declined to do so. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary, said: “Jeremy Hunt’s words will read hollow to the millions of people who have been left worse off after 14 years of economic failure. “Prices are still rising in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are soaring and the average family will be £1,200 worse off under the Tories’ tax plan. “Britain needs change and a Labour government, not five more years of Conservative failure.”"

        "content": "When the outspoken Tory MP Lee Anderson quit as one of his party’s deputy chairmen last week over his support for an ever-tougher approach to migrant crossings, he said he was acting “for the residents of Ashfield”, the Nottinghamshire seat he seized from Labour at the last election. Anderson said he felt compelled to strengthen the Rwanda bill – designed to deport migrants arriving in small boats – after receiving thousands of emails from residents worried about the Channel crossings taking place some 200 miles away. His decision was a sign of how fraught the issue has become within his party, but also confirmation that the shadow of a coming election now hangs heavy. Inevitably, he and other Tory MPs in former Labour seats captured in 2019 now face a year of relentless electioneering – and many believe a tough stance on immigration will help them. On a frosty morning in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, a small former mining community in the constituency, there was some evidence for Anderson’s claims. “There’s too many people in the country, I think,” said Ivan Rose, who recently retired. “If you keep building houses, we’ll get more flooding like we’ve had.” Sharon Shu, selling shoes in the market, said her mother had friends who were scared to boil the kettle for fear of their electricity bill. “I think we should look after them first,” she said. Another shopper even suggests “minefields along the Channel”. Yet the overriding sentiment among those who spoke to the Observer was a visceral hostility to all politicians – an anti-politics instinct that long predates Channel crossings and which some accuse Anderson of fuelling. “I’ve voted for both parties over the years, but it’s difficult to vote for anyone at the moment,” said Rose. “I don’t think they’re bothered about people up here.” Tony Shu, working in the market with his wife, agreed. “It’s just like a continual flow of bad news,” he said. “What could win an election for a party? I don’t know whether anybody’s offering anything different.” It doesn’t take long to discover why many here feel abandoned. While terms like “red wall seat” and “left-behind town” have become a political shorthand for these former industrial heartlands, it is easy to detect a deeply held pride in the area’s past that has been bruised over decades. That civic pride is personified in Kirkby by Christine Kidger, 75, whose free labour has kept the town’s heritage centre (a shop front just off the high street) going for years. She previously championed a commemorative mosaic near the site of Summit Colliery, Kirkby, which has since become a business park. “I left school when I was 15,” she explained. “I could have given a job up on the Friday and I could’ve had a new job for the Monday. When you’ve got your pit, you’ve got your community, haven’t you? The pit closed in ’69. Then of course all the factories went. A lot of the shops are gone. All we’ve got really now is takeaways and barbers and nail places. It’s sad when you think about how it was and now.” It is a lament instantly recognised by Gloria De Piero, who represented the area for Labour until 2019. “If you’d gone back 30 or 40 years, all the men would have worked on the pits and the women would have worked in textiles. There were good, well-paid jobs. Now, people are working, but not paid very well. There’s a great community spirit. People care about law and order, border controls. But they’re typically more left wing economically. They know that they’re getting a raw deal.” That sense of stagnation has set the scene for an election campaign here fuelled by an anti-Westminster sentiment. It means that while a Labour victory looks likely in theory, there can be no guarantee it will overturn Anderson’s 5,733-vote majority. It may help explain that while there has been a rush of would-be Labour candidates in nearby Rushcliffe, there has not been such a stampede to be the party’s representative in Ashfield. In fact, Labour didn’t even secure second place at the last election. In a sign of the Westminster hostility, that went to an independent candidate, Jason Zadrozny, the leader of the district council. Zadrozny is running again – he has already attacked Anderson as being “as thick as mince” – despite currently facing trial on 12 counts of fraud by false representation and four counts of income tax evasion. He denies the charges. Then there is Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit party, whose candidate Henry Grisewood – a “positive psychology” coach – believes he can be the most plain speaking in a race between plain speakers. “There’s lots of changes that need to happen in Great Britain,” he said. “Reform has got some really genuinely good ideas. They’re not just saying it, like most political parties.” While Anderson has chosen an outspoken style and immigration as the topic with which to tap into local angst, it is also clear he has become a divisive figure.  Interactive  “I think he comes out with really ill-informed comments. Quite significant comments about immigration, but also homeless people,” said Laura Walker, 51, who was out walking her dog. She accused him of fuelling local despair. “People have been seduced into feeling aggrieved about things – and that leads to them thinking that people who don’t work or aren’t from the UK are somehow responsible for that.” Another constituent said all he wanted was “the end of Lee Anderson”. There are those openly opting for Labour, but it comes with heavy scepticism. “I’ll probably vote Labour and see what happens,” said Susan Crooks, with a sigh. Her husband Malcolm is more cynical. “All Labour does is diss the Conservatives but not actually say what they would do differently, which is totally annoying. So we’re none the wiser.” Back in Westminster, many colleagues of Anderson and other red wall MPs – such as Miriam Cates in Penistone and Stocksbridge or Andrea Jenkyns in Morley and Outwood – question whether their chosen tactic will ultimately help them. “That’s not how national elections work,” said one veteran. Another observed, more bluntly: “It won’t work.”"

        "published_date": "2024-01-20T19:03:54+00:00",
        "content": "London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for young people to be able to move freely to and from the EU for the first time since Brexit in order to lessen the economic and cultural damage caused by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Speaking to the Observer in one of the most pro-European interventions by a senior Labour politician since the 2016 referendum, Khan said he backs either a bespoke “youth mobility” agreement with EU countries, or changes to post-Brexit visa rules that currently restrict travel and the ability to work in other European countries. His remarks suggest Labour, under Khan, will be running a strongly pro-European, anti-Brexit campaign for the mayoral elections in the capital in May. While not advocating rejoining the EU, Khan has previously called for a “pragmatic debate” on whether the UK should rejoin the single market and customs union when the terms of the Brexit deal come up for discussion again in 2025. The Observer understands that the office of Labour leader Keir Starmer, who opposed Brexit but has since been reluctant to criticise it for fear of offending Labour voters who backed leaving the EU, was informed of Khan’s comments and did not try to block them. Khan’s main challenger as he seeks a third four-year term is expected to be the rightwing Conservative and strongly pro-Brexit candidate Susan Hall. In 2021, Hall was widely criticised, even by Tories, for arguing that the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the equivalent of UK politicians who opposed Brexit. A Labour source said: “I think Sadiq’s people realise how anti-Brexit most voters are in London and understandably they want to appeal to them.” A source close to the mayor said there were about 1.2 million people from EU countries who were eligible to vote in the mayoral contest. With recent polls showing that most people now regard Brexit as a failure – and support for closer ties with the EU growing - Khan said that the capital had been particularly hard hit. “The government’s hard Brexit has done damage right across London and it is young people who have been hardest hit in so many ways. “Not only is it more difficult for young people to move abroad for work, but the government’s wrong-headed decision to leave the Erasmus scheme has made it much harder for students to study abroad too. “I’m clear that I’d be supportive of a youth mobility scheme, which would benefit us economically, culturally and socially. While the UK may no longer be part of the EU, London is, and always will be, a European city.” Khan wants new rules to allow young people to study, travel and fill vacancies in key sectors of the economy. This would apply to Londoners wanting to go to EU countries and young EU citizens wanting to come to London. Last July, former Tory cabinet minister and leading Brexiter George Eustice backed a similar idea, calling on Rishi Sunak’s government to open bilateral negotiations with EU nations immediately, with a view to offering young Europeans under 35 the right to two-year visas to work in this country. Eustice said the deals should be reciprocal, so that young UK citizens under 35 would be able to live and work for two years in the same EU member states with which deals were struck. This, he said, would be part of a much-needed “post-Brexit reconciliation” with our European neighbours. The Home Office has said it is looking at the possibility of some form of youth mobility scheme. It is understood that Khan believes a new scheme could be of particular benefit to sectors such as hospitality, which is historically reliant on EU workers, who do not meet the criteria for a visa under the new points-based immigration scheme. The hospitality sector has seen some of the highest worker shortages post-pandemic. Naomi Smith, chief executive of the internationalist thinktank Best for Britain, said polling by her organisation showed clear support for such a move, as more and more people concluded that Brexit was restricting young people’s life chances and harming the economy. “A reciprocal youth mobility scheme with the EU is win-win, giving young Brits the chance to live, work and travel across the continent while throwing a lifeline to UK businesses still suffering from acute labour shortages made worse by Brexit,” she said. Charles Owen, managing director of Seasonal Businesses in Travel, a trade body that represents many holiday companies, said: “The UK has some of the best-loved pubs, clubs, hotels and restaurants in the world but the pandemic, food inflation, the energy crisis and labour shortages has hit the industry hard. A youth mobility scheme is not a magic bullet; but it could relieve some of the pressure on labour shortages and save some from pulling down their shutters for good.” A recent independent report by the analyst Cambridge Econometrics, commissioned by City Hall, showed London has 290,000 fewer jobs than if Brexit had not happened, with half the total 2m job losses nationwide coming in the financial services and construction sectors. The report found that the average Briton was nearly £2,000 worse off in 2023, while the average Londoner was nearly £3,400 worse off last year as a result of Brexit. It also calculates that there are nearly 2m fewer jobs overall in the UK because of Brexit, with almost 300,000 fewer jobs in the capital alone."

        "content": "HMRC has not charged a single company under landmark legislation passed six years ago to crack down on corporate tax evasion.   Related: A tax evasion law not publicly enforced may as well not exist   Critics say the data, released under freedom of information laws to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and TaxWatch, suggests that HMRC is undermining its own deterrents against corporate tax evasion by failing to use its criminal enforcement powers. Margaret Hodge MP called the findings appalling and said the lack of enforcement had rendered the law “a paper tiger”. The Observer previously reported that the overall number of concluded prosecutions after HMRC investigations had fallen by more than two-thirds in five years, with only 11 wealthy taxpayers prosecuted in 2022. The Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced new powers to charge companies and partnerships operating in the UK that failed to stop their employees or associates from facilitating tax evasion, regardless of where in the world the tax was evaded. One part of the new law, known as the Corporate Criminal Offences clause, drastically lowered the bar for prosecuting businesses that enabled tax evasion. It introduced “strict liability”, meaning that a company cannot plead ignorance of the wrongdoing to evade a criminal charge, and prosecutors do not have to prove intent in order to secure a conviction. It also threatened unlimited fines in the case of established wrongdoing. Companies can avoid punishment if they have reasonable procedures in place to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion. The law both made criminal prosecutions easier to pursue and strengthened the penalties. In April 2016, in response to the leak of the Panama Papers which revealed how companies and the rich exploited tax havens, David Cameron, then prime minister, said: “Under current legislation it is difficult to prosecute a company that assists with tax evasion. But we are going to change that.” But critics say the refusal to charge a single company has cast serious doubts on the landmark legislation. “The lack of any Corporate Criminal Offence prosecutions is quite serious,” said Dan Neidle, founder of Tax Policy Associates and formerly head of tax at Clifford Chance. “A deterrent that you never use is no deterrent.” Criminal penalties were the only reliable way to change behaviour, while the over-reliance on civil penalties and fines often failed to curb serious wrongdoing, Neidle said. “If you disarm yourself and don’t use the criminal tools that you have available, then you are missing the trick.” A spokesperson for HMRC said: “Corporate criminal offences were introduced to encourage organisations to put preventative measures in place to stop tax evasion. Our efforts have helped drive a corporate culture shift towards anti-tax evasion awareness, which has led to new procedures across business sectors.” HMRC said it has 11 live investigations and is looking into a further 24 possible cases. It has also reviewed and rejected an additional 94. Hodge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax, said: “We are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, and tax evasion is costing our economy billions each year. So it is appalling that HMRC has failed to prosecute a single enabler of tax evasion. “We know that there continues to be a whole industry that supports those who don’t want to pay their fair share of tax. We cannot drive cultural change in that industry if its members are under the impression that this offence is just a paper tiger.” HMRC prioritises the recouping of money lost to tax avoidance and evasion through civil settlements, rather than prosecutions, according to Robert Palmer, the director of Tax Justice UK. He cited the risk and cost of prosecuting powerful opponents with deep pockets. “HMRC is routinely outgunned by the private sector,” he said. “It’s a real problem, because the minute you go against someone who’s rich, they can lawyer up and drag things out. HMRC are outmatched … particularly when it comes to the professional enablers and facilitators.” Other legislation with similar “failure to prevent” clauses has resulted in charges and convictions. The UK Bribery Act 2010 made it a crime to fail to prevent bribery and has led to high-profile prosecutions, including the oil and gas company Petrofac in 2021. The realistic threat of criminal prosecutions means “the Bribery Act continues to be taken very, very seriously,” said Neidle, “whereas the Criminal Finances Act is dropping off the radar.” Susan Hawley, director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “Legislation only has a deterrent effect for so long without any meaningful enforcement. “The government urgently needs to get to the bottom of whether this lack of prosecutions is related to failures of political will or resourcing issues at HMRC, or deeper problems with the wording of the offence.” Edward Siddons is a reporter at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism"

        "content": "A keynote speech by David Lammy at a Labour-linked thinktank’s conference has been disrupted by protesters who held Palestinian flags as they shouted “ceasefire now”. As security officials at London’s Guildhall rushed to take the first two individuals out of the building, another three protesters began shouting and criticising Labour’s stance on the Israel-Gaza war as Lammy attempted to continue his speech at the Fabian Society event. Lammy had returned to the stage to huge applause after the first pair of protesters were led out of the venue, saying: “I was born in Tottenham, don’t worry,” before adding: “Friends let me be clear, we want a sustained ceasefire in Gaza.” One of the protesters shouted: “David Lammy, you should be ashamed of yourself,” referring to Labour’s shifting position on the war in the Middle East. “We really need a ceasefire, people are dying,” they said as they were led out of the venue. Lammy decided to address their chants of “ceasefire now” head on as more tried to derail his speech on Saturday, responding: “Change through power not through protest,” in a similar response to the words Keir Starmer used when he was glitter-bombed at party conference.    “My friend, we all want a sustainable ceasefire,” he said, as he was once again interrupted by chants. Addressing the crisis, the shadow foreign secretary said: “In Gaza, thousands of children have been killed. Over 85% of the population has been made refugees and more than 100 Israeli hostages are still held as prisoners, while rockets are still flying into Israel. The situation is intolerable. It’s unbearable. Which is why Labour has called for a sustainable ceasefire.”   Related: Netanyahu’s rejection of Palestinian state unacceptable, says David Lammy   He also criticised the Israeli prime minister’s rejection of a two-state solution, describing it as “morally wrong”. Lammy called on the Israeli state to swiftly change its “pain and despair” approach. “The peaceful quest for a Palestinian state is a just cause as Keir Starmer said, it is undeniably a rite of passage and the only way to guarantee just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. The Israeli government must immediately change their approach from the pain of despair; new weapons and new political processes must emerge to make two states a reality.” Lammy said a Labour government would start urgent diplomatic talks on the creation of a new international contact group to take over from the defunct quartet – the UN, US, EU and Russia – to coordinate with western and Arab partners over Middle East peace. His speech came after that of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who urged voters not to “let the Tories do to London what they’ve done to our country”, as he hit out at their “hollow, desperate and divisive narrative”. Khan attacked the Conservatives for “exploiting people’s fears, but never addressing them”, in an attempt to lead the electorate to believe they were “struggling because of someone else”. The London mayoral elections in May would be be “the toughest fight yet”, Khan told the audience, because it will be the first time London has used the first-past-the-post system and the voter ID system will also be in force."

        "content": "Mass redundancies in the video game industry, with thousands of developers losing their jobs, have led to a record surge in workers joining unions, organisers have told the Observer. The fledgling Game Workers branch of the IWGB union saw its membership jump by almost half between December 2022 and December 2023 as job cuts worsened in the sector, including at the studios behind bestselling games such as Fifa, Skyrim and The Witcher. In October 2023 alone, membership jumped by 12%, a month after Epic, the developer of Fortnite, announced it was cutting hundreds of jobs as the studio was “spending way more money than we earn”. Last week, a poll of more than 3,000 workers in the industry found that 35% of developers said they or a colleague had been affected by the cuts. The UK has Europe’s biggest video game workforce, with the industry contributing £5bn to the UK economy each year. But studios and publishers, both in the UK and around the world, are now making cutbacks to compensate for an underwhelming growth after a pandemic-driven boom for video games failed to continue. That has only been worsened by the economic downturn and inflation. Announced cuts at games studios worldwide suggest at least 10,500 staff lost their jobs last year, but given that dozens of the 170 companies involved did not reveal the number of staff affected, the true figure is likely to be significantly higher. Globally, those cuts included the gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA), which is behind major series such as Fifa, Battlefield and The Sims. Other big names in the industry, including Bethesda, Activision Blizzard and CD Projekt RED, were also badly affected. Ukie, the UK’s main video games industry body, claims that around 900 of an estimated 11,100 job losses were roles based in the UK, equivalent to more than one in 30 of all those employed by the sector in the UK. “It’s felt like a deluge of redundancies in the past five or six months. It just keeps coming and coming,” said Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers branch. “And with this wave, I’ve seen people saying ‘we need to join unions’. Our membership went through the roof. We had the largest growth of new members in any month in our five-year history at the end of last year.” The union was first formed five years ago amid growing concerns among video games workers over precarious working conditions, endemic sexism at certain studios and constant excess overtime (a practice known as the “crunch”). The pace of job losses seems unlikely to slow as at least 17 studios have already announced plans for further redundancies affecting thousands of employees. In one case, Unity, a video game software firm that makes the engine used as a base for many of the world’s most popular games, including Among Us and Cuphead, announced it would be cutting off 25% of its workforce, or some 1,800 employees. “It has been difficult to hear of the job losses in the video games sector over the recent few months,” said Ukie co-CEO Daniel Wood. “Our analysis suggests this is a rebalancing following successive years of significant growth during the pandemic. “We continue to work hard to ensure the UK remains a great place to start and scale up games businesses, and we urge the government to use the budget to create the conditions needed for games businesses to grow.”"

        "content": "At the centre of this week’s mega-poll that projected an election wipeout for the Conservatives there lurked both a mystery and a statement of the obvious. Who was behind it? No one seemed to know. But what do they want? Seemingly, a change from Rishi Sunak. It is a sign of Sunak’s plight that the poll – fronted by a Tory peer and explicitly framed as showing the prime minister’s policies are leading the party into doom – was not even the greatest act of disloyalty in a week when 60 backbenchers voted to amend his flagship migration policy. That said, the YouGov survey of 14,000 voters, extrapolated to constituencies to give the headline finding of a post-election Conservative party reduced to 169 MPs, was arguably even more ominous for Sunak, for a series of reasons. Firstly is the fact that he appears to face a new and thus far anonymous opponent. While the polling, set out in Monday’s Daily Telegraph, was presented by Lord Frost, the estimated £70,000 cost was covered by the Conservative Britain Alliance, a previously unknown organisation described only as a “group of Conservative donors”. The organisation, if that is what it is, has no web presence, and no register as a company, charity or electoral entity. Those rumoured to be behind it who have insisted they are not include Paul Marshall, the hedge fund manager behind GB News, and a series of other figures in the rightwing Tory firmament. A spokesperson for Marshall denied he had paid for the poll and said he had never previously heard of the alliance. Under British Polling Council guidelines, all polls have to say who commissioned them. However, this needs only a name to be contacted – in this case David Frost – and does not need to specify who paid for the work. In place of facts have swirled various rumours, including the idea that the backers are working on behalf of ministers or former ministers who want to replace Sunak, whether before the election or, more likely, in its wake. The agenda of those behind the poll was clear. Both the Telegraph and Frost argued in Monday’s paper that the answer was to focus squarely on the concerns of Tory voters minded to defect to Reform UK, with the former arguing that this could mean the difference between a landslide loss and a hung parliament. While this prescription was arguable – YouGov took the unusual step of adding a note to its explanation of the poll rubbishing it – such manoeuvrings are deeply unwelcome to Sunak and his team, with senior No 10 officials known to be furious. On Monday evening, a clearly exasperated Isaac Levido, the Australian political strategist who is Sunak’s campaign director, told a meeting of Tory backbenchers that it was time to “get serious” if they actually wanted to win the election. “Let me be clear: divided parties fail,” he warned them. What does it all mean? As ever it depends who you ask. Tim Bale, the professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, and a close observer of the Conservatives, said it appeared to be a salvo by a faction loyal to the small-state wing of the party. “Clearly, there is some sort of concerted plan by someone to get rid of Rishi Sunak. It’s not simply about wanting to push the Conservative party in a certain direction, they’ve got so desperate they might want to precipitate a leadership challenge,” he said. Whether this would succeed was another matter, Bale said: “I think most Conservative MPs are persuaded of the fact that they would make themselves a laughing stock if they went through all that again. And also, there’s no one sensible waiting in the wings who would want to do it.” Among the few Conservatives who are public in their desire to replace Sunak is David Campbell Bannerman, the former MEP who coheads the Boris Johnson-friendly Conservative Democratic Organisation. “Sunak staying on will just guarantee we’re out of power for 10 years if not more. If you lose on the scale that these polls suggest, down to 160 MPs, it’s a hell of a cliff to climb,” he said. “My view is that Starmer is beatable with the right policies and the right leader, or at least we’ll have a respectable showing. Currently, Conservative voters are on strike, are not coming out, and under Sunak they won’t come back.” In contrast, one Tory backbencher usually loyal to Sunak simply rolled their eyes when asked about the poll. “It was probably people who wanted a return of Boris Johnson, but frankly it’s just very unhelpful,” they said. It did, however, have some uses, they added: “It’s clear that a plurality of people in the country are more to the right on immigration than we are and we would do well to remember that.” One thing all sections of the party appeared united on was an insistence that they have no idea who is behind the Conservative Britain Alliance. “I don’t know who they are. I hadn’t come across them before,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former cabinet minister. “When a poll comes out that shows, seat by seat, that your party is not doing well then you are obviously interested in that.” While Rees-Mogg is a sometime critic of Sunak, he said that if the mystery poll backers did seek a change of prime minister, he would not support this: “I see no point in destabilising the leadership of your own party this close to the election. I just don’t think it makes any sense.”"

        "content": "The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has described Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state when the war in the Middle East ends as “unacceptable”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he echoed Keir Starmer’s reaction to Israeli prime minister’s stance. Lammy said: “We are committed to the recognition of a Palestinian state. We want to work with international partners to achieve that.” He said the US president, Joe Biden, was right to have committed to working towards helping the Palestinians move towards statehood. “And I have to say, I think Netanyahu’s words were unacceptable,” he added. “Of course, the Palestinian people deserve a state, and if they don’t, the consequence of that is either one state in which Benjamin Netanyahu would have to explain how Palestinians and Israelis live side by-side with equal rights, or no state, in which what he is really saying is occupation, and siege continues.” On Thursday, Netanyahu said he rejected any moves to establish a Palestinian state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza, and that all territory west of the Jordan River would be under Israeli security control. After Netanyahu’s comments, the White House national security adviser, John Kirby, told reporters: “There will be a post-conflict Gaza, no reoccupation of Gaza.”   Related: Biden says two-state solution still possible after call with Netanyahu   Biden, however, voiced hope that establishing a Palestinian state was still possible even while Netanyahu remains in office after a call with the Israeli leader on Friday – their first talks in nearly a month. Starmer this week criticised Netanyahu’s rejection of moves to establish a Palestinian state as “wrong and unacceptable”. Rishi Sunak has previously said the UK’s longstanding position is that a two-state solution is the right outcome. The UK Conservative government and the Labour opposition, along with the US, have said they back Israel’s right to defend itself after Hamas’s 7 October attacks. Both have expressed support for a “sustainable” ceasefire but have resisted calls to back an immediate one. However, the Israeli government has been urged by western allies to limit the scope of its offensive and act within the parameters of international law. Israel currently faces a case at the UN’s international court of justice brought by South Africa, which accuses it of genocide over its actions in Gaza – a charge Israel denies. Earlier this week, the White House announced it was the “right time” for Israel to lower the intensity of its military action in Gaza. However, Netanyahu struck a defiant tone, repeatedly saying the offensive will not be halted until it realises its goals of destroying Hamas and bringing home all remaining hostages."

Launching the Fabian Society’s conference on Saturday with a keynote speech, the London mayor will attack the Conservatives for “exploiting people’s fears, but never addressing them”, in an attempt to lead the electorate to think “you’re struggling because of someone else”. The London mayoral elections in May “will be the toughest fight yet”, Khan will tell the audience at the leftwing thinktank’s event, because it will be the first time London uses the first past the post system and the voter ID system will be in force. “The progress London’s already made and ambitions we’re yet to meet are now at stake … because in a little over 100 days Londoners will have their say on who they want as mayor,” he will say on Saturday, adding: “It’s going to be a tough fight and one we must win.” Khan will use the speech to outline his achievements in office including the introduction of universal free school meals for primary pupils, freezing single tube and bus fares until 2025 and “helping every Londoner in every borough – regardless of background – to breathe cleaner air”. “Let me finish by saying that 2024 offers us the greatest prize of all … a Labour mayor working with a Labour prime minister for the benefit of all.” Khan will promise voters a Labour government will give the NHS “new life” after the Conservatives have “forced our NHS on to life support”. “Every primary school in England will have a fully funded breakfast club … the first step toward a childcare system which meets the demands of 21st-century life. And with a ‘new deal for working people’, we’ll agree a fair contract with workers fit for a modern economy,” he will add. “Britain is at its best when Labour is at its best.” Last week, Khan announced plans to extend universal free meals for primary schoolchildren for another academic year. He will promise Londoners continued cost of living support because the crisis “hasn’t disappeared”. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, will also address the conference, during which he will reaffirm Labour’s commitment to reaching a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza. Lammy will announce that a Labour government would start urgent diplomatic talks on the creation of a new International Contact Group to take over from the defunct Quartet – the UN, US, EU and Russia – to coordinate with western and Arab partners over Middle East peace. “The quest for Palestinian statehood is a just cause,” he will say. “It is, as Keir Starmer has said, the inalienable right of the Palestinian people and the clear logic of any call for a two-state solution. That is why a Labour government will work with international partners to recognise the state of Palestine.” Outlining Labour’s vision for foreign policy in 2024 and beyond, Lammy will argue that “progressive realism” will underpin Labour’s plan to reconnect Britain on the world stage in the face of “the new world disorder”. “Our progressivism will be built on realism. Progressive because our foreign policy will be founded on our values of equality, the rule of law and internationalism. Realist because we will focus on making practical, tangible progress with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.” On the war in Ukraine, Lammy will warn: “We in Europe risk taking our eye off the ball”, with a direct attack on Vladimir Putin, calling him a “ringleader of a new form of fascism”. Lammy will close noting there is “reason for hope” despite progress being “too slow”, pointing to projections for global heat reduction from 3.5C to 2.4C since the Paris climate agreement in 2016."

In his weekly Daily Mail column, the former prime minister argued that if Trump backs Ukraine in its war against Russia, his renewed leadership “can be a big win for the world”. However, Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on continued US support for Kyiv if he is re-elected, while boasting about his relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin.   Related: Zelenskiy slams Trump’s rhetoric on stopping the war as ‘very dangerous’   Trump, who has also repeatedly been openly critical of Nato, previously claimed that he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine in 24 hours. Johnson wrote: “I simply cannot believe that Trump will ditch the Ukrainians; on the contrary, having worked out, as he surely has, that there is no deal to be done with Putin, I reckon there is a good chance that he will double down and finish what he started – by giving them what they need to win. “If that is the case, then there is every chance, under Trump, that the west will be stronger, and the world more stable.” Earlier on Friday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, invited Trump, who is the frontrunner to get the Republican nomination, to visit Kyiv. In an interview with Channel 4 News, the Ukrainian leader said: “Yes please, Donald Trump – I invite you to Ukraine. “If you can stop the war during 24 hours I think it will be enough to come to Kyiv, on any day I am here.” In his column, for which reports suggest the Daily Mail is paying him £1m a year, Johnson wrote that the “global wokerati” feared a Trump victory. “In the cocktail parties of Davos, I am told, the global wokerati have been trembling so violently that you could hear the ice tinkling in their negronis,” he wrote. Elsewhere in his column, Johnson conceded that the former Republican president, who is facing 91 felony charges across four criminal cases, has “been caught saying a few unguarded things”. Johnson claimed that “what the world needs now is a US leader whose willingness to use force and sheer unpredictability is a major deterrent to the enemies of the west”. He also said that Trump is interested in “a proper free trade deal” with Britain, after hopes of a full-blown trade deal were abandoned last year. PA Media contributed to this report"

Related: Netanyahu tells US he opposes creation of Palestinian state after Gaza war   Starmer has supported Israel’s “right to defend itself” in Gaza against Hamas but has more recently called for a sustainable ceasefire and hit out at the “intolerable” casualties. His position has caused tensions within Labour, with many in the party pressing him to be more critical of Israel’s military action which has caused an estimated 24,000 deaths. Asked for his reaction to the Israeli prime minister, Starmer told broadcasters: “The comments [made by] prime minister Netanyahu are unacceptable and they are wrong. “Palestinian statehood is not in the gift of a neighbour. It is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people. It’s also the only way to a secure settlement and a secure future.” Netanyahu’s public statement on Thursday is his most forceful rebuttal of US foreign policy at a time when the Biden administration has expended huge domestic political capital to support Israel militarily and in international forums. The White House responded by saying the US would continue working towards a two-state solution and that there could be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza when the war concluded. “There will be a post-conflict Gaza, no reoccupation of Gaza,” the White House national security adviser, John Kirby, told reporters onboard Air Force One after Netanyahu’s speech. Rishi Sunak has previously said the UK’s longstanding position is that a two-state solution is the right outcome.

        "content": "UK Foreign Office legal advisers were unable to conclude that Israel was in compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL) in its bombardment of Gaza, court documents reveal. After reviewing specific potential breaches of IHL cited in a report by Amnesty International, the Foreign Office initially concluded it had “serious concerns” about breaches. The UK Department for Business and Trade is being challenged by the Global Legal Action Network in a judicial review over its decision not to revoke arms export licences to Israel. The evidence presented by the business department in its defence, prepared by Sir James Eadie KC, shows a far more intensive investigation was under way inside the government about Israel’s compliance with international law than suggested by the foreign secretary, David Cameron. Giving evidence to the foreign affairs select committee a fortnight ago, he said no special internal review had been made. The evidence shows there were four separate assessments, one of which prompted the receipt of assurances from the Israeli embassy. Soon after Israel attacked Gaza, an internal stocktake of 28 existing licences and 28 pending applications began, leading to an initial assessment on 10 November, followed by further reviews completed on 27 November, 8 December and 29 December. The 27 November Foreign Office internal assessment unit concluded “the volume of strikes, total death toll as proportion of those who are children raise serious concerns”. It said the Foreign Office had “concerns around the basis on which Israel is granting or withholding consent for humanitarian access”. It added that the government’s inability to make a conclusion on Israel’s compliance with IHL “posed significant policy risks”. But even after receiving a lengthy letter of reassurance from the Israeli embassy on 26 November, the government joint assessment unit said the UK and Israel had different views of what compliance with IHL required. It concluded it did not have sufficient information on compliance, and left the decision to ministers. As a result the government export control joint unit wrote to Lord Cameron on 8 December offering him three options: continuing exports but keeping them under review; suspending exports specifically likely to be used in Gaza; or suspending all arms sales to Israel. Cameron on 12 December opted for the first option and concluded there was “good evidence to support a judgment that Israel is committed to complying with IHL”. On the basis of this advice the business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, formally endorsed the continuance of arms export licences to Israel on 18 December. In another damaging revelation, the government lawyers also refused to tell the court whether they agreed Israel was entitled to cite article 23 of the Geneva convention and prevent free passage of humanitarian supplies on the basis there was a risk the aid may be diverted. The Foreign Office lawyers also asserted that Israel as an occupying power did have a legal duty to provide supplies, but conceded Israel did not believe this obligation extended to Israel itself providing aid, but instead only to allowing others to do so in certain circumstances. The government’s lawyers also claimed there was no obligation on the UK to block arms exports on the basis it must prevent a potential genocide, saying any obligation applied only when a genocide had actually occurred. “Actual knowledge that genocide is taking place or would take place is required,” the government lawyers said. The Labour MP Zarah Sultana said: “These documents expose that whilst ministers were giving public reassurances about Israel’s compliance with IHL in private there were major concerns in the Foreign Office about Israel’s behaviour.” Emily Apple of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “Cameron should have shared this evidence with the foreign affairs committee. He chose not to, and was evasive despite intensive questioning.” She challenged ministers to explain why the Foreign Office inquiry was limited to asking the Israeli embassy to respond to allegations about five specific incidents set out in a report prepared by Amnesty International, rather than officials compiling a dossier of their own."

        "content": "Senior Labour officials are to hold crunch meetings on the future of the party’s pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, amid reports Keir Starmer is preparing to ditch the entire plan. Party sources said on Friday that officials would meet in the coming days to discuss the green prosperity plan, which would see a Labour government spend £28bn on environmental schemes each year by the second half of the next parliament. A Labour spokesperson said Starmer remained committed to the plan after the Sun reported he had decided to drop it altogether. Sources have told the Guardian that the Labour leadership is still considering abandoning it if they decide it is likely to damage them in an election campaign. One said: “There are discussions going on about this at official and political levels. There are more meetings to come this week but a final decision has not been made yet.” A spokesperson for Starmer said: “We are committed to Labour’s green prosperity plan to drive growth and create jobs, including our plan to ramp up to £28bn of annual investment in the second half of the parliament, subject to our fiscal rules.” Rachel Reeves first announced the spending plans in 2021, saying it would be funded by extra borrowing and would make her the country’s “first green chancellor”. But earlier this year the shadow chancellor scaled it back, saying the party would hit its target only in the second half of the parliament – and only if it could still show debt was falling as a proportion of economic output in five years’ time. Current projections would give the party only an additional £13bn to spend on the green plan in five years’ time, although Labour officials said their plans to stimulate economic growth would give them more money to play with than currently forecast. Starmer has spent much of the past few weeks insisting he remains committed to the plan and does not intend to scale it back further. Earlier this month he told Sky News he was willing to have a public fight with the Conservatives over the idea of borrowing money to invest in the economy. Last week he told the BBC: “I am very pleased to make the case for investment in the future, and that’s why we will invest £28bn in total by the second half to the parliament, subject of course to what the government’s already assigned to put in on green prosperity, and of course within our fiscal rules.” On Tuesday the Labour leader met union leaders, where he repeated his insistence that he would not drop the green scheme. One person briefed on the meeting said union chiefs had been impressed by the strength of his commitment to the scheme. Many in the party are worried about what will happen at the next budget, when Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce more tax cuts that will eat further into the fiscal headroom. Some Labour MPs believe Starmer is preparing to drop the policy after the budget and blame it on the government. And they believe that the Conservatives are preparing to run an election campaign heavily featuring Labour’s green policies and arguing that they will mean tax rises in the future. One Labour MP said: “Starmer’s office thinks there’s an attack coming – Labour won’t cut your taxes and will spend your money on windmills.” Labour MPs will meet on Monday, where backbenchers will press the party leadership for more concrete answers on the future of the plan."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been captured on camera being challenged by a former health worker about the struggling state of the NHS. The prime minister was walking through Winchester, Hampshire on a visit when the woman tried to ask him what he was doing to improve the health service. In the clip, Sunak was heard telling the woman that there had been progress in reducing the waiting lists before strikes hampered the government’s efforts to bring them down last year. The woman said he could “stop it all” and that she wanted the NHS to go back to the way it used to be. Sunak then laughed, but a Downing Street source said he was responding to something in the crowd rather than to the woman. She said to Sunak: “If you had a problem, you could go to the hospital. My daughter spent seven hours waiting with an asthma problem.”  🩺 Watch the moment Rishi Sunak is challenged about the state of the health service by a former NHS worker.Sky News captured a woman asking the prime minister why strikes are so prevalent.More here: https://t.co/xItZsH7tea pic.twitter.com/TI4yMEMQ4k— Sky News (@SkyNews) January 19, 2024  As she was speaking, Sunak was told by an aide that he had to move on and he turned his back to the woman and started walking. She walked with him and he said: “I’m sorry to hear that. The key thing is we have resolved all the industrial action apart from the junior doctors who have still not settled yet.” At the end of the encounter, the woman thanked him and shook his hand. Keir Starmer said Sunak appeared out of touch. “I’ve seen that clip and it further reinforces, I think, what many people across the country think: that this prime minister doesn’t talk to people, doesn’t engage, doesn’t understand, what so many people are going through,” the Labour leader told broadcasters. “We have a terrible problem with our waiting lists and that is why we have been really clear that we would get rid of the non-dom tax status where the super-rich don’t pay their tax in this country, and use that to bring down those waiting lists … We have got a plan, we engage with people over our plan, we don’t laugh and walk away.” The footage was captured by an off-duty Sky News camera operator. The Conservatives later tweeted their own version of the footage, saying: “Today the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had a productive discussion on how we are delivering record funding for the NHS & cutting waiting lists while meeting members of the public.”"

        "content": "\n 5.02pm GMT \nClosing summary …\n\nWe will be wrapping this blog up shortly. Here are the main political headlines of the day …\n\nThe owner of Port Talbot steelworks has confirmed that the plant’s two blast furnaces will shut down, in what unions have described as an “absolute disgrace” that will cost up to 2,800 jobs directly and many more in the south Wales community. Rishi Sunak insisted that the government’s investment showed it was “absolutely committed” to British steelmaking, but Keir Starmer is urging the government to take another look at the plan proposed by steel unions that would have saved thousands of jobs\nA Fujitsu boss condemned the “shameful” editing of witness statements and said the company had “clearly let society down” while appearing before the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry. He also offered an apology for what he described as an “appalling miscarriage of justice”.\nDowning Street added to an earlier Sunak statement that he was “determined” to get the Rwanda bill through parliament “as quickly as possible” by saying it was “confident” Rwanda would implement improved measures into its asylum system in time for a new treaty with the UK being ratified by parliament.\nThe Home Office has hired an aircraft hangar and aeroplane body to train security staff on how to deport people, as the UK government increases the number of people it forcibly removes each year.\nSunak added to speculation on pre-election tax cuts by saying there was “more to come” if voters stuck with the Conservatives. Speaking to broadcasters during his visit to Hampshire, Sunak said a 2p cut to the main rate of national insurance that came into force this month had been a “tax cut for 27 million people in work”. Inflation unexpectedly jumped on Wednesday, and this morning figures revealed retailers in Great Britain suffered a dire Christmas, with shops recording the biggest fall in monthly sales since closing during the pandemic.\nThe defence secretary, Grant Shapps, posted on social media that yesterday he visited HMS Diamond, which is deployed in the Red Sea and has been one of the vessels involved in UK strikes against Yemen’s Houthis.\nNicola Sturgeon has been accused of “a shocking betrayal of the people of Scotland” as it emerged that the former first minister, along with other senior ministers and health officials, deleted all their WhatsApp messages related to the Covid pandemic.\nThree victims of IRA bombings in London and Manchester can sue Gerry Adams in a personal capacity for damages, a high court judge has ruled.\nNorthern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said he will introduce “pragmatic, appropriate and limited” legislation to try to break the political deadlock there which has been preventing Stormont from meeting since May 2022.\nThe European court of human rights (ECHR) has issued a press release stating that Ireland has lodged an inter-state application against the UK over the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023.\nChurn in the UK’s civil service is at its highest level since 2010 aside from its post-pandemic peak, with almost 12% of Whitehall staff changing department or leaving the government workforce in the year to the end of March, according to an analysis.\n\nThank you for reading today. I will be back with you bright and early on Monday. \n\n\n\n 4.44pm GMT \nKey points from Fujitsu CEO appearance at Post Office Horizon IT inquiry\n\nToday’s session of the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry was dedicated to hearing evidence from Fujitsu’s Europe chief, Paul Patterson. Here are the key points that emerged …\n\nPatterson said it is “shameful and appalling” that courts hearing cases against Post Office operators over missing funds were not told of 29 bugs identified as early as 1999 in the accounting system it built.\nWhen bugs were acknowledged, witness statements from Fujitsu staff due to be heard in court were then edited by the Post Office as it sought to maintain the line that the system was working well as it pursued innocent people through the courts. Patterson agreed that both organisations had failed the accused.\nPatterson said Fujitsu had “let society down” and that the company would contribute to a fund to compensate “victims of this crime” although he admitted to not having met a single Post Office operator as he had not believed it appropriate.\nPatterson said there was “evidence” that Fujitsu employees had a “don’t share with the Post Office” approach to a document chronicling the known errors in the system.\nHe said the “vast majority” of bugs, errors and defects (BEDs) in the Horizon system were shared with the Post Office contemporaneously. But Post Office operators were not informed about known errors nor provided with the accessible raw data. Patterson admitted that Fujitsu’s witness statements in support of Post Office cases in the criminal and civil courts were misleading.\nFujitsu had previously described its audit data as “gold standard”. Pressed on this, Patterson responded: “No, it wasn’t.”\nPatterson, the most senior Fujitsu Services Ltd director, who started his career at the company in sales, had opened his evidence with an apology to the men and women pursued by the Post Office with the assistance of his company.\nPatterson said: “To the subpostmasters and their families, we apologise, Fujitsu apologises and is sorry for our part in this appalling miscarriage of justice. We are determined to support this inquiry and get to the truth, wherever it lies, and at the conclusion of the inquiry and the guidance from this inquiry engage with government on suitable contributions and redress to the subpostmasters and their families.”\n\nYou can read Daniel Boffey’s full report on the day’s proceedings here: Post Office IT scandal – Fujitsu boss condemns ‘shameful’ editing of witness statements\n\n Related: Post Office IT scandal: Fujitsu boss condemns ‘shameful’ editing of witness statements \n\n\nUpdated at 5.02pm GMT\n\n\n 4.28pm GMT \n\nRowena Mason is the Guardian’s Whitehall editor\nChurn in the UK’s civil service is at its highest level since 2010 aside from its post-pandemic peak, with almost 12% of Whitehall staff changing department or leaving the government workforce in the year to the end of March, according to an analysis.\nThe Institute for Government’s annual Whitehall monitor found there had been a drop since 2022 when, after the worst of the Covid crisis, 13.6% of civil servants left their jobs – but it remained higher than at any point since the Conservatives took power 14 years ago.\nIn the introduction to the report, Dr Hannah White, the director of the IFG, said: “Staff turnover fell from its immediate post-pandemic peak but remains too high and continues to harm institutional memory. Further real-terms pay cuts continue to hinder the civil service’s ability to attract and retain top talent, as do slow and onerous processes for recruiting from outside government. A worrying fall in staff morale has raised questions about how the institution is led.”\nRhys Clyne, one of the report’s authors, said churn was a serious and longstanding problem in the civil service, and its high level may be related partly to dissatisfaction with pay and levels of morale.\nRead more of Rowena Mason’s report here: Staff turnover in UK civil service ‘at highest level since 2010’\n\n Related: Staff turnover in UK civil service ‘at highest level since 2010’ \n\n\n\n\n 4.14pm GMT \n\nThe Plaid Cymru leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, has responded to Rishi Sunak’s earlier comments that the government was “absolutely committed” to British steelmaking. He posted to social media:\n\nHollow words and little action by the prime minister on Tata just won’t cut it. The economic uncertainty his party created is bad enough, let alone the personal uncertainty crippling thousands of workers and their families in Port Talbot and beyond today. The UK government claims it’s committed to the future of steelmaking – at this eleventh hour, the reality must match the rhetoric.\n\n\n\nHollow words and little action by the Prime Minister on Tata just won’t cut it. The economic uncertainty his party created is bad enough, let alone the personal uncertainty crippling thousands of workers and their families in Port Talbot and beyond today. 1/2 https://t.co/iQl2Trr2Dt— Rhun ap Iorwerth (@RhunapIorwerth) January 19, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm GMT\n\n\n 4.11pm GMT \n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is urging the government to take another look at the plan proposed by steel unions that would have saved thousands of jobs at the Tata Steel plant.\nStarmer said he was “very concerned” after Tata Steel confirmed plans to close blast furnaces at its plant in Port Talbot, south Wales.\nHe told broadcasters:\n\nI was there just in October so I know how this is going to impact on the workforce. The government said it had a plan for steel. It transpires the plan involves thousands of redundancies. There’s a better plan, a multi-union plan, that the government needs to look at again.\nThat’s a viable way forward. It’s vital we have a viable steel industry in the UK. Labour has got a plan for that viable future, not just for the next year or two but for decades to come.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm GMT\n\n\n 3.58pm GMT \n\nOne of the main stories today has been the announcement that the Tata Steel blast furnaces at Port Talbot are to close, costing up to 2,800 jobs. Nils Pratley has this analysis of the alternative plan being suggested by unions:\n\nThe plan from the Community and GMB unions – rejected as unaffordable by Tata – was not an other-worldly proposal that imagined Port Talbot’s blast furnaces could keep polluting for ever, or that every last job could be preserved (just that compulsory redundancies could be avoided). It made the reasonable-sounding point that an electric arc furnace-only approach carries industrial risks and has uncertain benefits for global emissions reductions. For purer specialist grades, UK manufacturers may end up importing those volumes from blast furnaces elsewhere.\nThe unions’ proposal called for a two-stage, decade-long transition to “green” steel. In stage one, only one of the blast furnaces – the one that is near the end of its life anyway – would be closed and the other would keep producing until 2032. The output would be replaced by an electric arc furnace half the size of the model proposed by Tata. In the second stage, the other blast furnace would close but the choice of replacement technology would be kept under review. It could be direct reduced iron and hydrogen, the green steel technology that uses raw materials and is being widely adopted in Germany and Scandinavia.\n“It is an industrial choice we are making as a country to get rid of blast furnaces,” says Jess Ralston of the independent analysts Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The government keeps talking about energy security, but this move is not going to do anything for energy security. It is going to make it worse.”\n\nRead more of Nils Pratley’s analysis here: Tata’s Port Talbot decision goes beyond Wales and even steel\n\n Related: Tata’s Port Talbot decision goes beyond Wales and even steel | Nils Pratley \n\n\nUpdated at 4.41pm GMT\n\n\n 3.47pm GMT \nFujitsu Europe CEO: company 'let society down' and trust in technology 'has been broken'\n\nThe head of Fujitsu Europe, Paul Patterson, has said trust in technology “has been broken” as a result of the Horizon scandal, and offered to meet post office operators who had been affected. He said the company had “clearly let society down”.\nAt the afternoon session, Patterson was being questioned by Sam Stein KC, a lawyer acting on behalf of post office operators.\nReferring to Fujitsu’s online mission statement “to build trust in society through innovation”, Stein asked: “Do you agree, instead, that the combination of Fujitsu and the Post Office’s creation of this scandal has damaged trust in innovation within society?”\nPatterson replied: “I think the history of this appalling miscarriage, Mr Stein, would tend to point that yes, trust has been broken and trust in technology and how technology is used and not used.”\nStein later asked: “Will you commit today to meeting with subpostmasters, their legal representatives … and discussing with them the way forward that can assist in seeking to show that Fujitsu means what it says by its apology and by its commitment to provide financial redress?”\nPatterson said “I have not met any subpostmasters in the past because I didn’t feel it was appropriate for me to do that. If that is a request from the subpostmasters and their representation, I will absolutely do that.”\nDuring the course of the afternoon session, he said:\n\nThis is a decades-old miscarriage which started a long, long time ago and involves many, many people in organisations, in that I think Fujitsu more recently, as we’ve understood more, we have clearly let society down and the subpostmasters down.\nI think we had our obligations to the Post Office to be at the front of everything we were doing and that was wrong.\nI think subsequently we’ve now seen where the evidence is taking us and the investigation is taking us and that’s why you’ve had the statements from Fujitsu more recently.\nI can’t comment on the past, I don’t know why things weren’t done in 1999 or 2005 – I don’t know. But what I can say is that as long as I’m here and doing what I’m doing, I’m going to do everything to make sure that we get to the truth.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.38pm GMT\n\n\n 3.41pm GMT \n\nRowena Mason is the Guardian’s Whitehall editor\nSky have issued a slightly longer version of Rishi Sunak’s awkward encounter with a former health worker challenging him about the struggling state of the NHS, which shows the encounter want on longer than first shown.\nIn the initially released clip, Sunak was seen being hustled away by aides as the woman said to him “If you had a problem, you could go to the hospital. My daughter spent seven hours waiting ….”\nThe longer version shows that the prime minister continued talking to her as she carried on walking with him, saying: “I’m sorry to hear that. The key thing is we have resolved all the industrial action apart from the junior doctors who have still not settled yet.”\nAt the end of the encounter, the woman thanked him and shook his hand.\nSunak had been explaining to the woman that there was progress in reducing the waiting lists before strikes hampered the government’s efforts to bring them down last year.\nA No 10 source said the interaction had ended cordially and pointed out that they had carried on walking and talking together.\nThe footage had been captured by an off-duty Sky News camera operator.\nAsked about the incident, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, told broadcasters: “It further reinforces, I think, what many people across the country think: that this prime minister doesn’t talk to people, doesn’t engage, doesn’t understand what so many people are going through.\n“We have a terrible problem with our waiting lists and that is why we have been really clear that we would get rid of the non-dom tax status where the super-rich don’t pay their tax in this country, and use that to bring down those waiting lists … We have got a plan, we engage with people over our plan, we don’t laugh and walk away.”\n\nUpdated at 4.36pm GMT\n\n\n 3.17pm GMT \nLabour: Sturgeon's deleted Covid WhatsApp messages are 'shocking betrayal of people of Scotland'\n\nLibby Brooks is Scotland correspondent\nThere has been a furious response across the political spectrum to the official confirmation that the former first minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney deleted their Covid messages – and that the national clinical director, Jason Leitch, joked in a group chat about his “pre-bed ritual” of deletion. [See 14.24 GMT]\nThe Scottish Labour deputy Jackie Baillie described the news as “a shocking betrayal of the people of Scotland”, and said it “shows the lengths that Nicola Sturgeon is prepared to go to in order to prevent justice for Covid-bereaved families”.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said both Sturgeon and Swinney “have huge questions to answer over their conduct in the wake of this devastating revelation”, adding that their actions “beg a very simple question: what were they trying to hide? Shamefully and outrageously for families of those who died during the pandemic, we may never know.”\nIn December, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told the Covid inquiry he was not advised that he should save WhatsApp messages from his phone, even after it was set up, and claimed he had no messages remaining from the pandemic period.\nSturgeon herself has previously responded through a spokesperson: “Any messages she had she handled and dealt with in line with the Scottish government policies. Nicola has provided a number of written statements to the UK inquiry – totally hundreds of pages – and welcomes the opportunity to give oral evidence to the inquiry again next month when she will answer all questions put to her.”\n\nUpdated at 3.25pm GMT\n\n\n 2.54pm GMT \n\nThere has been some reaction to that awkward interaction between Rishi Sunak and a woman in Winchester over the NHS, where the prime minister appeared to laugh at her suggestion he could put the NHS back to how it was and then walk away from her.\n\n\nExclusive footage of Rishi Sunak challenged this morning by a former health worker on the state of the NHS, - captured by an off duty @skynews camera operator pic.twitter.com/aN8QKTjnH4— Tamara Cohen (@tamcohen) January 19, 2024\n\n\nThe shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “Rishi Sunak has no idea of the misery NHS patients are going through. When patients try to tell him, he laughs in their faces and walks away. When Sunak asks for their vote later this year, he will get a taste of his own medicine.”\nThe Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine accused the prime minister of “laughing in the face of a former health worker whilst they are trying to explain to him the dire straits the NHS” is in, calling it “frankly shocking”.\nThe woman had been saying to Sunak: “You could make it all go back to how it used to be … where, if you had a problem, you could go to the hospital. My daughter spent seven hours waiting.”\nPA Media has put together some facts and figures on NHS waiting lists in England, which Sunak’s government is responsible for. The prime minister had been trying to tell the woman that the backlog of cases in the NHS had been going down during the periods there were not strikes.\nIt reports about 6.39 million patients across England were waiting for routine hospital treatment in November, figures suggest, which was down slightly from 6.44 million in October.\nBut the NHS in England is still failing to hit most of its key performance targets, with 11,168 people waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment at the end of November, up from the previous month.\nA&E times also worsened in England, with 69.4% of patients seen within four hours in December, down from 69.7% in November and against a target set for March this year of 76%.\nHealth has been a primarily devolved matter for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland since 1999.\n\nUpdated at 4.35pm GMT\n\n\n 2.47pm GMT \n\nThe Post Office Horizon IT inquiry has wrapped up for the day. Paul Patterson, Fujitsu’s Europe CEO, has been told he can expect to be recalled at a later date. He is told he is released as a witness for now, so that he is able to talk to his team in order to answer questions and make such further inquiries as the proceedings may require. The presiding retired judge high court judge Sir Wyn Williams said it wouldn’t be practical in these circumstances to do anything else.\nThe inquiry will resume on Tuesday at 10am with a session featuring Robert Daily – a former Post Office investigator involved in the criminal investigation of Peter Holmes and William Quarm – in a section titled “Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions in Scotland and Northern Ireland” which is expected to last two weeks.\n\n\n\n 2.32pm GMT \n\nThe Post Office Horizon IT inquiry is continuing. Fujitsu Europe CEO Paul Patterson has just told the session he was surprised that Fujitsu was offering, and being paid, to send expert witnesses to Post Office prosecution cases. There is a stream you can watch here.\n\nUpdated at 4.33pm GMT\n\n\n 2.24pm GMT \nNicola Sturgeon deleted all her Covid WhatsApp messages, inquiry told\n\nLibby Brooks is Scotland correspondent\nWith the UK Covid inquiry still taking evidence in Scotland, today’s hearing in Edinburgh has been told that the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon did not keep any of her Covid WhatsApp messages.\nThe startling revelation came from Lesley Fraser, the director general corporate of the Scottish government, who said messages were deleted “in routine tidying up of inboxes or changes of phones” but that Sturgeon would have worked with her private office and those instructions would be retained.\nThis is the first official confirmation that Sturgeon did not keep any of her pandemic messages – she previously refused to clarify to journalists whether she had deleted messages, while insisting she had “nothing to hide”, and it also contradicts the commitment she made in August 2021 when she announced there would be a Scottish Covid inquiry and pledged to disclose her private messages.\nThe inquiry was also told that the former deputy first minister John Swinney had set up an auto-delete function whilst the national clinical director Jason Leitch had sent a message to a colleague stating that “WhatsApp deletion is a pre-bed ritual”.\nAsked by Jamie Dawson KC for the inquiry if the Scottish government’s record retention policies “were simply not fit for purpose” during the pandemic, Fraser said she did not accept this but understood “hurt and frustration” about not being able to access WhatsApp messages and the policies should be reviewed.\nAlso giving evidence, Ken Thomson, the former manager of the Covid Coordination Directorate of the Scottish government, said that Sturgeon “did not take a decision in informal messaging”.

We will consider issues that are raised – motions and amendments – in the usual way.\nIn terms of the improvements and the assurances that we have with the government of Rwanda, we are confident that there will be implementation of all of those measures in line with the timelines for the treaty.\nSo those assurances that we provided, which responded to issues raised by the supreme court, will be in place when we get flights off the ground.\n\nThe spokesperson declined to get into speculation about how the government might react to changes to the bill introduced during its passage, saying: “I’m not going to get ahead of parliamentary processes and processes in the Lords – that starts to get into hypotheticals.”\nEarlier today the prime minister said:\n\nIn order to fully solve this problem we need to have a deterrent, so that when people come here illegally they won’t be able to stay and will be removed.\nThat is why the Rwanda scheme is so important, and that’s why I’m determined to get it through parliament and get it up and running as quickly as possible so we can properly solve this problem.\n\nIn November, five judges at the supreme court unanimously upheld an appeal court ruling that found there was a real risk of deported refugees having their claims in the east African country wrongly assessed or being returned to their country of origin to face persecution.\n\nUpdated at 1.57pm GMT\n\n\n 11.53am GMT \n\nThe Post Office Horizon IT inquiry has restarted.

Details of the expansion of the programme were first reported by the Times. The specialist training, which the government has carried out for years, will also be given to staff who deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nA Home Office spokesperson said:\n\nSince 2015, the government has had training facilities to ensure escorts can respond professionally to the challenges of removing people with no right to be in the UK. This includes practical sessions so escorts have the skills they need to deal with different scenarios. As we ramp up removal activity we will continue to ensure new escorts have the training facilities necessary.\n\nA government source said the department had recently hired the hangar and fuselage so that staff could practise accompanying people on to planes and learn what to do if they resisted, either by fighting back or refusing to move.\nIt comes as the government steadily increases the number of people it deports after a sharp drop during Covid and as a result of the new returns deal with Albania. In the year to March 2023, Britain forcibly returned 4,193 people, nearly a third more than in the previous 12 months.\nRead more here: Home Office hires hangar for staff to practise Rwanda deportations\n\n Related: Home Office hires hangar for staff to practise Rwanda deportations \n\n\nUpdated at 1.55pm GMT\n\n\n 11.48am GMT \nSunak hints 'more to come' on tax cuts following Hunt's comments in Davos\n\nDuring his media appearance this morning, Rishi Sunak added to speculation on pre-election tax cuts by saying there was “more to come” if voters stuck with the Conservatives.\nSpeaking to broadcasters during his visit to Hampshire, Sunak said a 2p cut to the main rate of national insurance that came into force this month had been a “tax cut for 27 million people in work”.\nHe continued:\n\nAnd we said that we do want to cut taxes for future events when we can responsibly do so.

Tata Steel should really look again at the multi-union proposal.\nDo we really want to be a country, given the dangerous and turbulent world in which we live, that isn’t able to produce its own steel?\nThere isn’t a single household in my Aberavon constituency that isn’t connected to the steelworks in some way, and the impact would be utterly devastating.\n\nVaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s economy minister, said that Tata Steel’s expected decision meant it was an “incredibly worrying day, not just for the steel workforce, but for Wales, and I think across Britain”.\nOn BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gething said:\n\nWhat this would mean, if this plan goes ahead, is that the UK would be the only G7 country that can’t make primary steel.\nIf you don’t wait for the technology to change, you will transfer your ability to do that to other parts of the world and be reliant on imports for a number of years. That is an issue not just for Wales – a strategic sovereign issue for the UK.”\n\nMy colleague Graeme Wearden is across all this in our business live blog, where he notes:\n\nThe prospect of thousands of job cuts at Port Talbot is particularly galling as the UK government agreed to pump up to £500m into the steelworks last year.

They are also preparing for the prospect of dirty protests and demonstrations by campaigners outside the airbase in an attempt to halt flights.\nIt is estimated that five officers will be needed for each migrant being removed.\n\nThere is liable to be criticism that this represents further Home Office spending on the Rwanda plan, with the actual legal departure of flights still a distant prospect.\n\nUpdated at 10.26am GMT\n\n\n 9.47am GMT \nWelcome …\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling live coverage of UK politics for Friday.

        "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of “a shocking betrayal of the people of Scotland” as it emerged that the former first minister, along with other senior ministers and health officials, deleted all their WhatsApp messages related to the Covid pandemic. The UK Covid Inquiry, taking evidence in Scotland, heard on Friday that Sturgeon “retained no messages whatsoever” while the national clinical director, Jason Leith, joked in a group chat that WhatsApp deletion was his “pre-bed ritual”. Sturgeon had previously refused to confirm or deny allegations that she deleted the messages but insisted she was committed to “full transparency” about her conduct during the pandemic, adding: “I have nothing to hide.” At the hearing in Edinburgh, Lesley Fraser, the director general corporate of the Scottish government, was questioned about details supplied by the Scottish government summarising ministers’ retention of messages and other forms of communication. Counsel to the inquiry Jamie Dawson KC said: “Under the box ‘Nicola Sturgeon’, it says that messages were not retained, they were deleted in routine tidying up of inboxes or changes of phones, unable to retrieve messages. “What that tends to suggest is at the time that request was made Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister of Scotland, had retained no messages whatsoever in connection with her management of the pandemic.” Fraser responded: “That’s what that indicates to me.” She went on to say that Sturgeon would have worked with her private office and those instructions would be retained. The documents also set out that messages sent by the former deputy first minister John Swinney were either manually deleted or he had used WhatsApp’s auto-delete function. This is the first official confirmation that Sturgeon did not keep any of her pandemic messages and contradicts the commitment she made in August 2021 when she announced there would be a Scottish Covid inquiry and pledged to disclose her private messages in evidence. Asked by Dawson if the Scottish government’s record retention policies “were simply not fit for purpose” during the pandemic, Fraser said she did not accept this but understood the “hurt and frustration” caused. Aamer Anwar, the lawyer representing Covid bereaved families in Scotland, said the deletion of messages “can only be described as a cynical and pre-meditated decision” and that Sturgeon and others “must answer as to their motivation”. He added that timing of deletion was crucial: “If auto-delete or manual deletion pre-existed the announcement of the public inquiry in August 2021, why was an order not then issued to stop any further deletion of WhatsApps?” Anwar continued: “Sturgeon should be treated no differently to Boris Johnson, who failed to provide WhatsApps from the start of the pandemic, while the prime minister Rishi Sunak claims to have none at all.” Also giving evidence, Ken Thomson, the former manager of the Covid coordination directorate of the Scottish government, said Sturgeon “did not take a decision in informal messaging” and that it was “rare” that she would message him at all. There has been a furious response across the political spectrum to the evidence. The Scottish Labour deputy, Jackie Baille, described the news as “a shocking betrayal of the people of Scotland”, while the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said Sturgeon and Swinney “have huge questions to answer over their conduct in the wake of this devastating revelation”."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-19T15:36:42+00:00",
        "content": "Churn in the UK’s civil service is at its highest level since 2010 aside from its post-pandemic peak, with almost 12% of Whitehall staff changing department or leaving the government workforce in the year to the end of March, according to an analysis. The Institute for Government’s annual Whitehall monitor found there had been a drop since 2022 when, after the worst of the Covid crisis, 13.6% of civil servants left their jobs – but it remained higher than at any point since the Conservatives took power 14 years ago. Dr Hannah White, the director of the IFG, said in the report that real-terms pay cuts, onerous recruitment processes and low staff morale were all factors contributing to the situation. The proportion of staff leaving the civil service altogether remained at its post-pandemic peak of 9%. Turnover was highest in the centre of government, at 26.2% in the Treasury and 23.7% in the Cabinet Office. In the introduction to the report, White said: “Staff turnover fell from its immediate post-pandemic peak but remains too high and continues to harm institutional memory. Further real-terms pay cuts continue to hinder the civil service’s ability to attract and retain top talent, as do slow and onerous processes for recruiting from outside government. A worrying fall in staff morale has raised questions about how the institution is led.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has pledged to address civil service churn, believing it is damaging the operation of government. Advised by the former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who is Starmer’s chief of staff, the party has been considering how to generate more stability within the civil service. Some of the possible solutions include better pay progression and incentives for remaining in certain roles, and using minimum terms of service for some jobs to prevent civil servants moving to a new Whitehall role before completing their term. Rhys Clyne, one of the report’s authors, said churn was a serious and longstanding problem in the civil service, and its high level may be related partly to dissatisfaction with pay and levels of morale. “It’s an acute issue,” he said. “There are a range of structural and cultural factors at play. One is the consequence of pay structures, so if people can’t progress and become more senior in a role over time then that creates incentives for staff to move roles more quickly. “There’s also perceptions about how civil servants progress in their careers. Particularly in policy careers, it’s encouraged that officials move roles to get different experiences quickly and that’s seen as the way that gets on. That contributes to churn at the expense of the development of subject area expertise.” Clyne added: “Satisfaction with pay is particularly low at the moment and real-term pay cuts accumulating over time is a real factor. Despite the fact that pay fell less this year than last year, we are still looking at now in the region of 10% to 26% real-terms pay cuts since 2010 and that’s only getting worse.” In its report, the IFG said the statistics were an underestimate of churn because they did not include moves within government departments. “This is a problem for the civil service because high turnover damages productivity, undermines subject knowledge and expertise, disrupts projects and increases the resources required for recruitment and training. This is a particular concern, given declining morale among civil servants,” the report said. “Demotivated civil servants are more likely to be open to new and often higher paid employment options outside the service – something that should be seen as a red flag for civil service leaders aiming to retain top talent.” Reported morale fell for a second year running, and less than a third of civil servants reported being satisfied with their pay – a nine percentage point drop from last year."

        "content": "Three victims of IRA bombings in London and Manchester can sue Gerry Adams in a personal capacity for damages, a high court judge has ruled. Mr Justice Soole ruled on Friday that the three victims cannot sue the IRA itself or the former Sinn Féin leader as a “representative” of the paramilitary group but that claims against him in a personal capacity would continue. The judge also confirmed that the victims would have legal costs protection. John Clark is a victim of the 1973 Old Bailey bombing in London, Jonathan Ganesh of the 1996 London Docklands bombing and Barry Laycock of the 1996 Arndale shopping centre bombing in Manchester. They lodged a civil claim last year for £1 nominal damages, alleging Adams “acted with others in furtherance of a common design to bomb the British mainland”, and was “directly responsible” in various roles within the IRA for decisions to plant the bombs. Adams, who denies ever being a leader or member of the IRA, asked the Royal Courts of Justice to throw out the case against the IRA and against him as a representative of the group. His barrister, Richard Hermer KC, had argued that the IRA was “incapable in law of being sued” and that the “representative” aspects of claims should be struck out. Soole agreed and struck out the legal action against the IRA, saying that as “an unincorporated association” and “not a legal entity” it could not be sued. He also ruled that the victims could not sue Adams as a “representative” of the IRA because the allegation that he was a leader of the organisation would have to be determined at a trial. However, he gave the green light for further legal action against Adams: “The claim against him in a personal capacity continues.” The judge also rejected an attempt by Adams to remove the victims’ legal costs protection. Matthew Jury, a solicitor for the bombing victims, welcomed the ruling. “Adams and his legal team’s apparent attempt to intimidate them into withdrawing their claims has rightly failed and their case will continue.” Jury said the case was the “last chance” to bring Adams and the IRA to justice because the government’s so-called legacy law had restricted further Troubles-related prosecutions and civil proceedings."

        "content": "The Home Office has hired an aircraft hangar and aeroplane body to train security staff on how to deport people, as the UK government increases the number of people it forcibly removes each year. Officials confirmed on Friday the department had increased its capacity to train officials to carry out deportations, including how to handle people who physically resist. Details of the expansion of the programme were first reported by the Times. The specialist training, which the government has carried out for years, will also be given to staff who deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, as the government pushes ahead with its plan to begin flights to the central African country by the spring. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Since 2015, the government has had training facilities to ensure escorts can respond professionally to the challenges of removing people with no right to be in the UK. This includes practical sessions so escorts have the skills they need to deal with different scenarios. “As we ramp up removal activity we will continue to ensure new escorts have the training facilities necessary.” A government source said the department had recently hired the hangar and fuselage so that staff could practise accompanying people on to planes and learn what to do if they resisted either by fighting back or refusing to move. It comes as the government steadily increases the number of people it deports after a sharp drop during Covid and as a result of the new returns deal with Albania. In the year to March 2023, Britain forcibly returned 4,193 people, nearly a third more than in the previous 12 months. The training will also be given to security officials who work on flights to Rwanda, sources confirmed, as ministers continued to push for the first flight to take off in spring. MPs passed the Rwanda bill this week without amendments, but it faces a two-month period of debate in the Lords before returning to the Commons to consider any further amendments. Rishi Sunak has put the scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda at the heart of his plan to stop small boats crossing the Channel. The prime minister said on Friday: “In order to fully solve this problem we need to have a deterrent, so that when people come here illegally they won’t be able to stay and will be removed. “That is why the Rwanda scheme is so important, and that’s why I’m determined to get it through parliament and get it up and running as quickly as possible so we can properly solve this problem.”"

        "content": "Union leaders have told Keir Starmer his position on Gaza risks alienating millions of Britons, telling the Labour leader their members are increasingly angry about his refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East. Members of Britain’s biggest unions used a regular meeting with Starmer this week to urge him to be more critical of Israel, following weeks of tension within the Labour party over the issue. Several also urged him not to rescind from his climate pledges, in a sign of how unions are likely to try to maximise their influence over Labour’s policy process as the party draws up its election manifesto. “Several people at the meeting were pretty clear with Starmer,” said one person with knowledge of what happened at the meeting. “They told him, ‘Your position on Gaza is alienating working people, you are out of step with the majority’.” The person added that the Labour leader responded that he wanted western countries to work towards a “sustainable ceasefire” rather than calling for one to be declared immediately. Starmer’s response to the Israel-Gaza war has been a source of tension between the Labour leader and many of his MPs, councillors and members for weeks. Last year he gave an interview in which he appeared to suggest Israel was within its rights to withhold water and power from Gaza. Even though he has since rowed back from that position, many of his colleagues and supporters remain angry that he has not done more to show sympathy with the plight of people in Gaza. Labour’s green policies have also become a problem for some on the left, as shadow ministers debate scaling back their commitment to spending £28bn a year on green schemes if elected this year. Two union leaders urged Starmer not to row back from the pledge, which the Labour leader recently described as an “ambition” rather than a promise. Those briefed on the meeting said Starmer did reassure them that he would not do so, though his shadow cabinet is still looking at ways to minimise the Conservative attacks on the scheme that are likely to amplify during an election campaign. A spokesperson for Starmer did not respond to a request to comment."

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has dangled the prospect of big tax cuts in his March budget, in what is seen as one of the last opportunities for the Conservatives to claw back Labour’s huge opinion poll lead. In his first public comments on his budget strategy, the chancellor made clear that only unexpected bad news would prevent him from answering the call from Tory MPs for a substantial giveaway before an expected autumn general election. Speaking in Davos, where he was attending the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, the chancellor said: “In terms of the direction of travel we look around the world and we note that the economies growing faster than us in North America and Asia tend to have lower taxes, and I believe fundamentally that low-tax economies are more dynamic, more competitive and generate more money for public services like the NHS. “That’s the direction of travel we would like to go in but it is too early to say what we are going to do.” Hunt’s precise room for manoeuvre will only become clear when he receives forecasts for the economy and the public finances in the coming weeks, but the picture has brightened since last November’s autumn statement due to falling inflation and expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. However, his remarks go further than he has previously. Just two weeks ago, when discussing the 2% national insurance cut at the centre of his autumn statement, he told reporters: “It’s the start of a process. As chancellor, if I can afford to go further I will. I don’t yet know if I can.”  The chancellor has come under pressure to cut taxes amid forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that they are heading for their highest level since the 1940s. Attempts to repair the damage to the public finances from the Covid pandemic and the energy bill subsidies that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have resulted in a multiyear freeze in tax allowances and thresholds.   Related: UK interest rate cuts cannot come soon enough for economy and Jeremy Hunt   After providing permanent tax breaks for business investment and cutting national insurance in the autumn statement, Hunt is expected to focus on income tax in the budget on 6 March. He did not rule out the possibility of a second pre-election package of measures this autumn but said that would depend on the poll date chosen by Rishi Sunak. “The prime minister hasn’t decided on the date of the election yet, or if he has he hasn’t told me. By law there have to be two fiscal events each year. We will see where we get to after the spring budget.” One senior Tory MP suggested that Hunt could focus on cutting national insurance. “It went down well at the budget, that message about hard work paying. An NI cut helps working people whereas an income tax cut helps people regardless of where their money comes from. We all recognise that people are too highly taxed just now”. A Conservative close to the chancellor said Hunt was considering cutting taxes at the budget and again at an early autumn statement before the election. “It would be very powerful to be able to go to the polls having had tax cuts at three successive fiscal events,” they said. However Hunt is understood to be reluctant to cut inheritance tax before the election, believing it will not have the same broad electoral appeal as reducing either income tax or national insurance. “Inheritance tax is one for the manifesto, if at all,” the source said. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has already indicated that a Labour government would reverse any cut to inheritance tax, arguing it would not “be the right priority”. “If there is money available for tax cuts, those tax cuts should benefit the majority of working people, not just the 3.7% who stand to inherit money,” she said this week. Reeves has also indicated that Labour would support any cuts to income tax introduced by the government in the spring budget, as long as they were within her party’s fiscal rules. “Yes, I want taxes on working people to be lower, I have made no secret about that,” Reeves said. “They are the highest for 70 years. But I wouldn’t do anything that broke the fiscal rules that I’ve set out.”  Hunt said the OBR’s assessment of the public finances for the budget could change right up to the last minute, but added: “I want to be open with you. I do believe the economy would be more successful if we had more competitive taxes.” Asked whether it was irresponsible to cut taxes when debt as a share of national income was close to 100%, he said: “It depends on how you fund the tax cuts. If you fund them by a significant increase in borrowing then you are just sending the bill to future generations. “If it is through inherent growth in the economy – and you can still see debt falling over a five-year period – it can be very pro-growth.” Hunt arrived in Davos early on Thursday by private jet after voting in the Commons on the government’s Rwanda bill. In his absence, Reeves made a pitch for the support of the assembled business leaders, hosting a breakfast organised by the US bank JP Morgan and talking on a panel about Labour’s supply-side measures to boost growth. Rishi Sunak reiterated on Thursday that tax cuts were his priority, telling reporters at Downing Street: “Without speculating on future budgets, which as a former chancellor I always preferred prime ministers didn’t do, our priority is to cut taxes when it’s responsible to do so.” "

As he notes, the neoliberal inspired attacks on trade unions and the hollowing out of the welfare state since the 1980s were particularly influential in the apparent decline in working-class solidarity. Despite these assaults, the purveyors of neoliberalism still meet stubborn resistance among the British public, just over half of whom favour increasing taxes to spend more on health, education and social benefits, with only small differences between Labour (61%) and Tory (46%) voters. The British Social Attitudes survey also finds that two-thirds agree that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation’s wealth. This bedrock of support for social democracy is waiting for Labour to articulate its priorities and to bring back a glimmer of hope.

        "content": "Was that really it? Another hastily called press conference on government premises that was really just a third-rate party political broadcast. There used to be rules about that sort of thing. Not that it did Rishi Sunak much good. Many more of these tetchy, moany outings and the Tories’ ratings will be even lower. On the plus side, it was short and sweet. Blink and you’d have missed the opening whinge. All done and dusted in well under three minutes. Though that’s still three minutes of our lives we will never get back. Perhaps I should have been thankful that yet again he refused to let sketch writers in to Downing Street to watch in person. Not even an email reply explaining why not. This is getting to be a habit. Sunak even tried to exclude me from his conference speech in Manchester. For a prime minister who claims to channel the democratic will of the people – more later – he sure as hell doesn’t like any form of accountability. Maybe he should actually try to get himself elected some day. The morning after the night before. You’d have thought that most people would have wanted to curl up under the duvet and not come out after the last three days that Sunak has had. Moments after his self-styled election guru, Isaac Levido, had instructed Tory MPs to unite or face annihilation, the party had gone into battle with itself. The right versus the far right. The only reason the Rwanda bill had passed was because at the last minute the Conservatives had concluded they would like their demise to be later rather than sooner. Victories don’t come much more hollow than this. Then there was the latest opinion poll. Sunak’s Tories were now 27 points behind Labour. That’s the same gap that Liz Truss had after dynamiting the economy. Imagine being that bad. That mistrusted. And Rish! was supposed to be a safe pair of hands. The tech bro who could manage the party’s decline. Now he too was also officially less popular – less effective – than a lettuce. That’s some achievement. Borderline heroic. But for Sunak the passing of the third reading of the Rwanda bill was not just another minor humiliation in a long line of other humiliations. It was a Triumph of the Will. More a cold and broken hallelujah. It’s come to this. A prime minister with a large majority feels the need to do a victory lap just because fewer of his own MPs than might have been expected rebelled. All hail the brave Lee Anderson for abstaining because opposition MPs might have laughed at him. Will we be getting more press conferences every time the government wins a vote? It could get very tedious. Rish! dashed to the podium. Trying to look authoritative, not just needy. A tough one. No one – not even his family – sees him as anything more than an interim prime minister. We’re just trying to get through the next few months without him doing even more damage to the country. “The Conservative party has come together,” he squeaked, unconvincingly. Er … if you say so. Though only to preserve itself. Not because it thinks the Rwanda bill is workable. Half the Tories are horrified at how far the party has lurched in its willingness to ignore international law. The other half feel it hasn’t gone nearly far enough. And then there are the halfwits, like Thérèse Coffey, who still haven’t been able to locate Rwanda on the map. She’s just a 30p Kiga Lee. Moving on. Sending refugees to Rwanda was “The will of the people”. That last refuge of the half-arsed populist who has run out of road. To recap. The Rwanda plan was only dreamed up as a distraction to get Boris Johnson out of a Partygate hole. It was never intended to be implemented. Hell, even Rwanda doesn’t want anything to do with it any more and it has trousered £400m of UK money. Not even Sunak and Cleverly believe it will work. The public has not been allowed a say. And if you’re worried about immigration, why not start with the 700,000 people the Tories have allowed in legally? Far better to pick on 30,000 refugees arriving in small boats. Then to the nitty-gritty. Unelected lords should not be allowed to hold up the bill. That would presumably include Lord Big Dave. Our unaccountable foreign secretary. But no, the lords must not be allowed to do their job of trying to improve bad legislation. Because it would be far better to have a rubbish law than allow anyone else to get their mitts on it. And in any case, the government would ignore anything the Lords said so why not cut to the chase? With this logic, we might as well all give up now. Hell, we’re all going to die some time. So why not now? “Labour … No plan … Square one,” Sunak muttered dementedly. Now on auto repeat. We could have been listening to a whiny, automated Maybot. Downing Street must have still kept the 1980s Amstrad malware. It was bonkers. Labour has plenty of plans. Surely Rish! knows that. Starmer has gone on and on about his Missions. You may not like them, but they exist. But Sunak can’t handle this reality. So he invents his own and tries to persuade us to join his fantasy. He’s like a teenager who has spent too long on his PlayStation. As for Square One? Gimme, gimme, gimme. Anything has to be better than where we are. Square Minus Three? As he moved on to questions, Rish! got progressively more tetchy. He always does. He just hates being challenged. Breakfast with him must be hell. “Can you pass the milk please?” “Why the fuck should I? What are you going to do for me? How about some gratitude?” Everything was just fine because he had said it was. Why did he need to keep repeating himself. Journalists should just learn to listen properly and shut the fuck up. “Our plan is working,” he yelled, sounding like a nasal mosquito. “Albania …” Can someone spell it out to him? Is he deliberately stupid? Sending Albanians back to Albania is not the same thing as sending Afghans to Rwanda. What’s more, the supreme court has said Rwanda is unsafe. What more do you need? Finding a tame KC who is looking for a safe Tory seat – if there is such a thing – who agrees with you doesn’t really cut it. But the irritation couldn’t conceal the truth. Because when asked a direct question, he couldn’t guarantee that a single refugee would be deported this year. He couldn’t quite bring himself to say he would break international law in every circumstance. “It will all be the fault of the Lords,” he said. Getting his excuses in early. Because deep down he wants the Lords to block him for as long as possible. Then he has an imagined enemy. For if one flight did take off, what then? The Rwanda plan would be exposed as a sham. Just 100 deportees out of more than 100,000 who have come here. Many of whom the government has no idea where they are. That’s no deterrent. The boats will keep on coming. Maybe the Lords should call Sunak’s bluff?"

He was speaking at a Downing Street press conference. See 12.04pm for a summary and analysis.\n\n\nA leading barrister and cross-bench peer, Alex Carlile, has condemned the government’s Rwanda bill as a “step towards totalitarianism” and signalled that the House of Lords plans to resist the legislation.\n\n\nThousands of public sector workers have staged pickets and marches across Northern Ireland in the biggest strike in living memory.\n\n\n\n\n 5.38pm GMT \nMore than half of Britons wrongly think illegal migration as high or higher than legal migration, poll suggests\n\nThe number of people who arrive in the UK illegally is far smaller than the number who arrive legally. \nIn the year ending September 2023 there were 45,081 illegal arrrivals, according to this Home Office report (which describes them as irregular arrivals). \nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the total number of immigrants coming to the UK in the year ending June 2023 was 1.2m. \nAllowing for the 508,000 people who emigrated, net migration was 672,000 in the year ending June 2023. \nThese figures include people who arrive illegally and claim asylum, but they are only a small proportion of the overall total. As this chart shows, most people coming to the UK either have a study or work visa, or are a dependant of someone who does.\nYet, according to polling from YouGov, voters are more likely to think (wrongly) that more people come to the UK illegally than legally than to think (rightly) that more people arrive legally. In fact, more than half of Britons wrongly think illegal migration is as higher or higher than legal migration.\nPeople who voted Conservative in 2019 are more likely to be wrong than people who voted Labour.\nAnd only 23% of all voters, and 16% of people who voted Tory in 2019, correctly realised that many more people come to the UK legally than illegally, the poll suggests.\n\nDo Britons believe more migrants come to the UK legally or illegally? \nAll Britons \nMore come illegally: 45% \nMore come legally: 34% \nAbout the same: 8% \n2019 Con voters \nMore come illegally: 56% \nMore come legally: 27% \nAbout the same: 8% \n2019 Lab voters \nMore come illegally: 33% \nMore come legally: 44% \nAbout the same: 7%\n\n\n\nDo Britons believe more migrants come to the UK legally or illegally?All BritonsMore come illegally: 45%More come legally: 34%About the same: 8%2019 Con votersMore come illegally: 56%More come legally: 27%About the same: 8%2019 Lab votersMore come illegally: 33%More… pic.twitter.com/KJfjt0lL1o— YouGov (@YouGov) January 18, 2024\n\n\nThese figures go a long way to explain why the Rwanda bill has become such a priority for Rishi Sunak.\n\nUpdated at 5.46pm GMT\n\n\n 4.46pm GMT \n\nThe Green party says the House of Lords should defy convention, which says its job is to amend bills passed by the Commons, not block them (see 2.41pm), and throw out the Rwanda bill. This is from Jenny Jones, one of the two Green party peers.\n\nWe really need to stop this appalling bill, it is not a manifesto commitment and convention allows the Lords to reject it. If the prime minister wants to claim the Rwanda bill is the will of the people then please hold a general election.\n\n\n\n\n 4.40pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 4.26pm GMT \nLow general election turnout likely with ‘dull as dishwater’ Sunak and Starmer\n\nThe polling expert Prof John Curtice has warned of low turnout at this year’s general election, in part because voters regard Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer to be as “dull as dishwater”, Matthew Weaver reports.\n\n Related: Low general election turnout likely with ‘dull as dishwater’ Sunak and Starmer \n\n\n\n\n 3.25pm GMT \nCameron dismisses Nadine Dorries' claim he is being lined up to be next Tory leader\n\nDavid Cameron has dismissed a claim from Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, that he is being lined up to be the next Conservative party leader.\nTwo days ago Dorries posted a message on X saying:\n\nI’m calling it now.The plan is to install David Cameron as next leader of the party following defeat in the GE.\n\n\n\nI’m calling it now. The plan is to install David Cameron as next leader of the party following defeat in the GE. THE PLOT https://t.co/sSFbD1uulu— Rt Hon Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorries) January 16, 2024\n\n\nThis was not written approvingly; she was critical of him when he was PM, and she became a very strong Boris Johnson supporter partly because she felt Johnson was not condescending towards her in the way she thought Cameron was.\nIn an interview with Times Radio, asked about Dorries’ prediction, Cameron replied:\n\nWell, she’s always been a much better novelist than a political forecaster. I think I’ll leave it at that.\n\nIn the interview the former prime minister was also asked if he minded playing “second fiddle” to Rishi Sunak. He replied:\n\nNo, not at all actually, because he’s a very clear boss.\nHe’s easy to work for because he knows what he wants. He chairs cabinet meetings with great efficiency. He’s read everything, understood everything. He knows what the issues that are contentious, that we have to discuss, are about. And he has a pretty clear view of what he wants, so that’s a good boss.\n\n\n\n\n 2.51pm GMT \nLabour says Sunak 'not fit for public office' because of his record of 'playing fast and loose with facts'\n\nLabour says the rebuke issued to Rishi Sunak today by the UK Statistics Authority over a misleading tweet about the asylum backlog (see 12.21pm) shows he is not fit for office. This is from Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, who is one of the MPs who complained to the body about Sunak’s post on X. Kinnock said:\n\nLabour wrote to the UK Statistics Authority a year ago to complain about Rishi Sunak repeatedly lying about the asylum backlog, and he was warned not to do it again.\nYet once again he has been caught red-handed. The prime minister’s addiction to playing fast and loose with the facts is the behaviour of someone not fit for public office.\nHe has not cleared the backlog – there are 100,000 people still awaiting a decision. He should adopt Labour’s backlog clearance plan, and deliver the security partnership we need to stop the boats getting in the water in the first place.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.03pm GMT\n\n\n 2.41pm GMT \nWhat will happen to Rwanda bill when it reaches Lords?\n\nA reader asks:\n\nAre there any potential amendments that the Lords could add that Labour and other opposition parties may support? I.e. some kind of amendment that would wreck the bill as imagined by #10? At the mo I assume Labour will vote against the bill itself so out of principle would not vote for any amendments either as that would be seen as flip-flopping. However, something that could gather support of 30 or so centrist Tory MPs and the opposition may cause Sunak all sort of headaches and potentially trigger a snap GE?\n\nYou would be wrong to assume that Labour will try to vote down the bill in the House of Lords. In the Lords, peers almost never vote on bills at second reading (which in the Commons is the main yes/no moment for deciding if a bill goes ahead). They mainly vote on amendments to the bill. Peers don’t think they have the constitutional authority to just vote down bills passed by the Commons.\nBut it is not hard to imagine amendments that would get the support of opposition parties, many crossbenchers and some Conservatives. Just look at the amendments to the bill in the Commons tabled by Yvette Cooper and Stephen Kinnock (for example, calling for the creation of a monitoring committee to review the Rwanda treaty, and to make sure Rwanda is complying) or amendments tabled by Tory centrists such as Robert Buckland and Jeremy Wright (eg, saying the Home Office has to be sure Rwanda is complying with the treaty before it starts deportations, or ensuring the UK cannot decide for itself if it is in compliance with international law). The amendments are here.\nSome amendments – these ones, or ones like them – will almost certainly be passed in the Lords. And, when the bill goes into ping-pong between the Lords and the Commons, peers will choose to fight hardest on a handful with most support.\nBut if the government holds firm, it is more likely than not that the Lords will eventually pass its version of the bill.\nGiven that Tory centrists did not rebel when the bill was in the Commons, I don’t think they are likely to do so when it returns from the Lords. And so I don’t think there is much chance of it generating the sort of crisis that would lead to an early election.\n\nUpdated at 3.07pm GMT\n\n\n 1.53pm GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nIn reference to the Rwanda bill – was the bill in the Conservative manifesto and, if not, could the House of Lords delay passing the bill for 12 months? Would the delay take the bill past the last date for the general election ?\n\nThe bill was not in the manifesto, and the Lords, in theory, could delay it, or block it altogether, but they won’t. Labour and the Lib Dems believe that would help Rishi Sunak make the argument the opposition parties are blocking the bill. But that’s not the main reason why they won’t. They will pass the bill, with amendments, because peers don’t think they have the democratic authority to block the Commons. They can just revise, and invite the government to “think again”.\nAccording to Henry Zeffman from the Times, a timetable for the bill has already been agreed.\n\nWhen will the Lords debate Rwanda?Understand much of the timetable has already been agreed2nd reading Jan 29Committee stage February 12/14/19Report probably March 4, 3rd reading March 12So MPs will be looking at (ie trying to remove) Lords amendments by about March 18\n\n\n\nWhen will the Lords debate Rwanda?

They said:\n\n5,598 (32%) remain in the UK and the Home Office is taking steps to urgently re-establish contact with them.\nWhere we obtain up-to-date contact details for a person from our tracing checks, we will then consider the most appropriate intervention, including whether to task an enforcement team to go and arrest them.\n\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, claimed this was further evidence that the asylum system was in chaos. She said:\n\nThis is a staggering admission that the Home Office has lost almost 6,000 asylum seekers and has no idea where they are. The fact that thousands of people have been allowed to effectively disappear into the underground economy or left vulnerable to exploitation by criminal gangs is yet more evidence of the shocking mismanagement and chaos in the Tory asylum system.\nTime and again ministers are spending their time on gimmicks rather than getting a grip. Labour will establish a major new returns and enforcement unit to properly track cases, take swift enforcement action and make sure those with no right to be in the country can be quickly removed.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.49pm GMT\n\n\n 1.21pm GMT \n\nThis is from Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, commenting on the UK Statistics Authority’s reply to his complaint about Rishi Sunak’s misleading tweet about the asylum claims backlog. (See 12.21pm.)\n\nNot only is the Conservative government celebrating something that is no achievement, they are twisting the facts - as proven by the UK Statistics Authority just today. \nAs this letter again shows, the Conservatives have not cleared the asylum backlog. Thousands of vulnerable people are still living in limbo as they wait for their claims to be processed. The British public deserves better than this.\n\n\n\n\n 1.16pm GMT \nMPs approve order to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir\n\nMPs have backed plans to ban the Islamist political group Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir has organised rallies which took place on the streets of London alongside pro-Palestine marches in recent months, following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nIt has already been banned in Germany, as well as in several Arab and Asian countries because of what the Home Office has described as its “long-term goal of establishing a caliphate ruled under Islamic law”.\nWith headquarters in Lebanon, the group also operates in at least 32 countries including the UK, United States, Canada and Australia.\nThe Commons approved plans to proscribe the group as a terror organisation today, and the House of Lords is expected to follow suit.\nThe ban will mean belonging to, inviting support for and displaying symbols of the group in public will be a criminal offence.\nIn the Commons, security minister Tom Tugendhat said the proscription order would cover the entire global organisation, as well as all regional branches including Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain.\nHe claimed the group engaged in “homophobic and antisemitic discourse”, that it “plays the mood music to which other terrorists dance”, and had glorified Hamas’s attacks on Israeli citizens on 7 October .\nTugendhat told MPs: “This proscription will serve as a reminder that the United Kingdom does not and will never tolerate the promotion of or encouragement of terrorism. It will send the message that promoting or encouraging Hamas’ sickening attack on October 7 is utterly unacceptable and at odds with the values of this country.”\n\n\nUpdated at 2.58pm GMT\n\n\n 1.12pm GMT \n\nMPs have been told that the government will publish its plans for full compensation for victims of the infected blood scandal by the summer. \nYesterday Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the inquiry into the scandal, said that the inquiry will publish its final report on 20 May.\nIn the Commons today John Glen, the Cabinet Office minister, said the the government was “committed to updating parliament on next steps within 25 sitting days of [the report’s publication]”.\nThe government has been criticised not finalising details of its compensation package ahead of the report’s publication. Yesterday Langstaff said:\n\nThe inquiry’s final recommendations on compensation were published in April 2023. My principal recommendation remains that a compensation scheme should be set up with urgency. No-one should be in any doubt about the serious nature of the failings over more than six decades that have led to catastrophic loss of life and compounded suffering.\n\nDuring business questions in the Commons today, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said she did not disagree with an MP who complained about the wait for the details of the full compensation package. “This house has also been clear in its desire to see this appalling scandal resolved quickly,” she said.\n\n\n\n 12.56pm GMT \nMPs call for public information campaign so parents know when mildly ill children should go to school\n\nSenior Conservative MPs have urged the government to launch a national public information campaign to help drive up pupil attendance in England’s schools and reduce pressure on GPs.\nThey say parents need advice on when it is appropriate to send their children to school with a mild illness, and when to “administer self-care” rather than going to their GP. An estimated 1.5m pupils missed 10% or more of scheduled classes in autumn and spring last year.\nRobin Walker, the chair of the Commons education committee, and Steve Brine, who chairs the health and social care committee, have written to the education and health secretaries outlining their proposal. The letter says:\n\nWe are writing to recommend a joint public information campaign between the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the Department for Education (DfE) to help pupils and parents make more informed decisions about attending school with a minor illness, and about appropriate situations in which to seek care from a GP.\n\nThe education committee has previously published a report on persistent absence. It found that illness is the primary cause, and it is significantly higher than before Covid owing to a shift in parental attitudes to sending their children to school with minor illnesses.\nThe Department for Education did address this issue last year in a letter it distributed to headteachers. The letter, signed by Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical for England, and other health leaders, said:\n\nThere is wide agreement among health professionals and educational professionals that school attendance is vital to the life chances of children and young people. Being in school improves health, wellbeing and socialisation throughout the life course. The greatest benefits come from children and young people attending school regularly.\nIt is usually appropriate for parents and carers to send their children to school with mild respiratory illnesses. This would include general cold symptoms: a minor cough, runny nose or sore throat. However, children should not be sent to school if they have a temperature of 38°C or above. We would encourage you to share the NHS ‘Is my child too ill for school?’ guidance with parents and carers in your schools and communities which has further information.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.02pm GMT\n\n\n 12.49pm GMT \n\nHumza Yousaf was challenged over the Post Office Horizon scandal at first minister’s questions. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, pressed him on an apparent mismatch between his preference for mass exoneration of Post Office scandal victims and the caution exhibited by the lord advocate, Dorothy Bain, earlier this week, when she insisted that not all convictions based on Horizon evidence might be unsound.\nIn contrast to the rest of the UK, it was the Crown Office that prosecuted Horizon cases in Scotland rather than the Post Office itself, and Bain apologised to victims in her role as the head of Scottish prosecutors on Tuesday.\nYousaf said it was still his preference to have legislation exonerating victims to be applied on a UK-wide basis through a legislative consent motion, and it’s clear that – like his UK counterparts – he favours expediency.\nBut because of the different position of the Crown Office as prosecutors of the cases in Scotland, there does remain a tension here; many MSPs working with wrongly accused constituents are asking why the Crown Office hasn’t been more proactive in encouraging those who may have been affected to come forward.\nBain noted on Tuesday that “not every case in which Horizon evidence is present will represent a miscarriage of justice”, pointing out that of 73 individuals written to by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission only 16 people had come forward to identify themselves as possibly affected.\nShe also acknowledged that some of those who did not come forward may simply be too exhausted or traumatised by their experience to want to re-engage, but this raises the question of what can be done to ease their experience going forward.\n\nUpdated at 12.58pm GMT\n\n\n 12.21pm GMT \nSunak reprimanded by UK's statistics watchdog over misleading claim about asylum claims backlog being cleared\n\nRishi Sunak and the Home Office have been reprimanded by the UK’s statistics watchdog over a misleading claim about the asylum claims backlog being cleared.\nOn 2 January the Home Office announced it had cleared the “legacy” backlog of asylum claims (defined as those submitted before June 2022, when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force). This was criticised as misleading because, as the Home Office admitted, 4,500 particularly complex cases had not been cleared. But Sunak went further later in the day when he posted a message on X implying the whole of the backlog had been cleared. Labour said that was a “barefaced lie”.\nAlthough the legacy backlog has been cleared, with the exception of 4,500 complex cases, there are still almost 100,000 cases in the overall asylum claims backlog.\nIn response to complaints about this from Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dems’ home affairs spokesperson, and Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, Sir Robert Chote, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, released an open letter to them saying people may have been misled and that the claims from the PM and the Home Office may have undermined trust in the government. Chote said:\n\nThe average member of the public is likely to interpret a claim to have ‘cleared a backlog’ [what Sunak said in his post on X] – especially when presented without context on social media – as meaning that it has been eliminated entirely, so it is not surprising that the government’s claim has been greeted with scepticism and that some people may feel misled when these ‘hard cases’ remain in the official estimates of the legacy backlog. That said, there may be a perfectly good case for excluding cases of this type from any commitment to eliminate the backlog over the timeframe the government chose, but this argument was not made at the time the target was announced or when it was clarified in the letter to the home affairs committee.\nThis episode may affect public trust when the government sets targets and announces whether they have been met in the other policy domains. It highlights the need for ministers and advisers to think carefully about how a reasonable person would interpret a quantitative claim of the sort and to consult the statistical professionals in their department.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.31pm GMT\n\n\n 12.04pm GMT \nSunak rehearses his general election messaging - summary and analysis of his Downing Street press conference\n\nRishi Sunak gave his press conference in No 10, and he was ostensibly talking about government policy, but in reality that was a party political event, where Sunak was rehearsing messages we are likely to hear endlessly as the year goes on. Politicians often sound boring when they just say the same thing over and over again, but message discipline is vital in campaigns, and Sunak can’t be faulted in this respect. His problem is not failing to get the message across; it’s what the message actually says.\nHere are the main points.\n\nSunak claimed that his party had “come together” over the Rwanda bill and that it was “completely united” in what it wanted. (See 10.18am.) He said:\n\n\nThe Conservative party last night demonstrated that they are completely united in wanting to stop the boats. This bill passed with an overwhelming majority in parliament …\nThe Conservative party is completely united in wanting to deliver for the country, cut their taxes and, crucially, to stop the boats.\n\nWhile it is true that almost all Tory MPs support the Rwanda policy in principle (agreement on ends), given there is so much disagreement about means, using the phrase “completely united’ is probably pushing spin too far. Most voters watching events in parliament this week will have concluded that the party is not united.\n\nHe challenged the House of Lords to accept “the will of the people” and to pass the bill unamended. He said:\n\n\nIt’s now time for the Lords to pass this bill. This is an urgent national priority.\nThe treaty with Rwanda is signed and the legislation which deems Rwanda a safe country has been passed unamended in our elected chamber.\nThere is now only one question. Will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected house? Or will they get on board and do the right thing?\n\nThis is similar to what Theresa May said about the Lords when she justified calling a general election in 2017, and what Boris Johnson said about parliament in general when he pushed for an election in 2019. History suggests that peers will take no notice, and that they will insist on scrutinising the bill with their usual thoroughness. The claim that the bill is the “will of the people” is also Johnsonite populism. Assessing public opinion about the Rwanda plan is complicated, because results vary a lot depending on how the question is framed, but it is not clear the policy does have majority support. Only yesterday YouGov published polling saying 40% of people agree with Labour’s plan to abandon the policy.\n\n\nWith the Rwanda bill vote today, our most recent polling on the proposed policy (last week) found the public are split 40% to 34% on whether Labour should reverse the policy if they win the next electionhttps://t.co/ZJXSqSUDJe pic.twitter.com/c0XuAMbbsF— YouGov (@YouGov) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\nSunak said that he wanted the first plane to Rwanda to leave “as soon as practically possible” – but he refused to give a target date. (See 10.35am.) In November last year he said he hoped the first flights would leave by the spring but, when asked if that was still his expectation, he dodged the question.\n\n\nSunak did not give a firm commitment to ignore injunctions from the European court of human rights (rule 39 orders) blocking deportation flights in all circumstances. Asked about this, he just repeated what he said on Monday, when he said he would be willing to ignore those in some circumstances. “There will always be individual circumstances where people rightly would expect us to examine the facts,” he said.\n\n\nHe insisted that his plan was working. He said:\n\n\nThis is an election year and the choice of that election is going to be clear.\nWe have got a plan. That plan is working if we stick with it, we can deliver a brighter future for the country. Renewed pride in our country. And the alternative is that we go back to square one because he [Keir Starmer] can’t tell you what he’s going to do because he doesn’t have a plan.\n\nThis has echoes of David Cameron campaigning in 2015 on the basis that the Conservatives had a “long-term economic plan”. The slogan worked, in that it conveyed a sense of purpose, even though no one could actually say what the plan was. Sunak is trying to pull off something similar, but it is a very hard ask, because public sector delivery in so many areas has been so dismal in recent years\n\nSunak repeatedly claimed Labour would take the UK “back to square one”. He used the phrase eight times. In the past I’ve argued that this a poor campaigning message, because many people would regard square one as an improvement, but James Johnson, a pollster who used to work with No 10, says this goes down well with voters who switched from the Tories to Labour. In a post on X last week reporting the results of a focus group, he said:\n\n\nKeir Starmer seen as “weak”, “spineless”, “unchallenging”, “boring” and – above all else – as having “no plan”. They are voting Labour *despite* Keir Starmer rather than because of him. Lack of plan/square one attack by Sunak was the only clip that went down well\n\n\n\nNEW 🇬🇧 Conservative-to-Labour switchers @jlpartnerspolls @timesradio focus group. Key points:💥 These switchers have left the Tories \"for good\", furious at lack of delivery of promises in 14 years of govt💥 Rishi Sunak has gone from a breath of fresh air a year ago to…— James Johnson (@jamesjohnson252) January 11, 2024\n\n\n\nSunak said Labour would put people’s taxes up because Starmer was committed to a £28bn “green spending spree”. He said:\n\n\nKeir Starmer once again can’t tell anybody how he plans to pay for this £28bn green spending spree. Can’t tell anyone. So what does that mean? That means everyone’s taxes are going to go up.\n\nThe Tories have been making this claim for ages now – it is the most frequently used attack line in the anti-Labour material sent out by CCHQ – but “green spending spree” is new, and this is the most succinct version of this message. Starmer has explicitly said that he won’t put up taxes to fund the green investment plan, and that if it cannot be done within Labour’s fiscal rules, it won’t happen.

Generally, it’s a thumbs down.\nThe reporters aren’t happy because Sunak did not have anything new to say. And the commentators are critical because what he did say wasn’t particularly plausible.\nFrom my colleague John Crace, the Guardian’s sketch writer\n\n\nSunak using Number 10 as a base for a second rate Conservative election broadcast— John Crace (@JohnJCrace) January 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\nSeems like Sunak is getting his excuses in early.

Of course, if the Middle East was not such a mess, there might be fewer people risking their lives in the Channel, but it is not a connection many UK politicians care to make. Whatever the motive, is making Gaza uninhabitable and sending planes to Rwanda the optimum policy solution to migration?\n\nFrom Adam Bienkov from Byline Times\n\n\n\"Many eminent lawyers, former Supreme Court judges, all of whom have said that our [Rwanda] plan will work,\" says Rishi Sunak, about a scheme that was recently unanimously ruled unlawful by the UK's own Supreme Court pic.twitter.com/hV2WJC4K6b— Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) January 18, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.06am GMT\n\n\n 10.42am GMT \n\nQ: If no flights leave, will you fight to get the UK’s money back from Rwanda?\nSunak says he is planning to get the flights off the ground. Many lawyers have said the plan will work.\nAnd that’s it. The press conference is over.\n\nUpdated at 11.05am GMT\n\n\n 10.40am GMT \n\nQ: What are the consequences for the Tory MPs who rebelled? Why have they not had the whip removed?\nSunak says his party is united in wanting to stop the boats. It is right to debate the issue, he says.\nIt is understandable why people are frustrated. He shares that frustration, he says.\nHe says, if they stick with the plan, the government can deliver a better future. Starmer can’t, because he has not got a plan.\n\n\n\n 10.37am GMT \n\nQ: 32% of people whose asylum claims were refused disappeared. What has happened to them?\nSunak says the vast majority of people whose claims were refused were either removed, or submitted another claim. They should be removed and sent home, he says. He says 20,000 people were returned. \nThis does not happen by accident. It happens because the government has a plan, he says.\n\n\n\n 10.35am GMT \nSunak says he wants first flight to Rwanda to leave 'as soon as practically possible' - but he won't give date\n\nQ: When will the first flight to Rwanda leave? In the past you said by Easter?\nSunak says he wants it to happen “as soon as practically possible”.\nBut he does not give a date.\nThe question is now for the House of Lords, he says.\nThe operational work to allow flights to happen is already under way, he says.\n\nUpdated at 10.36am GMT\n\n\n 10.33am GMT \n\nQ: Your MPs are not convinced you actually will ignore rule 39 orders from Strasbourg. Can you lay down some red lines to clarify that you will?\nSunak repeats the line about how there are circumstances in which he would ignore these injunctions.\n\n\n\n 10.32am GMT \nSunak says taxes will go up under Labour because of its £28bn 'green spending spree'\n\nQ: Are you confident you can cut taxes in the budget?\nSunak says his priority is “to cut taxes when it’s responsible to do so”.\nHe says the government has already cut tax, and he wants to “keep cutting people’s taxes”.\nHe wants to live in a country where hard work is rewarded.\nHe repeats the point about Starmer’s “green spending spree”. Labour can’t say how it will be funded, “which just means your taxes are going up”.\n\n\n\n 10.29am GMT \n\nQ: Your legal advice says ignoring a ECHR injunction will be illegal. So will you seek new legal advice?\nSunak says he will not let a foreign court (such as the European court of human rights) stop flights taking off. There are circumstances in which he would ignore a rule-39 order, he says.\nBut he says “there will always be individual circumstances where people rightly would expect us to examine the facts”.\n\nUpdated at 10.32am GMT\n\n\n 10.27am GMT \n\nQ: The Lords normally don’t stop legislation. They just delay it. If the bill passes by the spring, will you guarantee a plane will take off before the election?\nSunak says, within weeks of the supreme court ruling, he had a treaty with Rwanda. That shows the urgency with which he is operating.\nThe Commons has backed the legislation with a strong majority. The Lords should now pass it, he says.\nHe says his message to the Lords is: ‘Look at the majority last night, this is important for the country, and we are confident it is legally robust.’\n\nUpdated at 10.32am GMT\n\n\n 10.25am GMT \n\nQ: You say the party is united. But several letters of no confidence in you have been submitted. What is your message to colleagues who say you are the wrong person for the job?\nSunak says he will stick with the plan because it is working. If he sticks with the plan, he will build a better future. The progress is demonstrable. We have had five months where wages have risen faster than prices. Inflation is down. Taxes have been cut.\nKeir Starmer is just sniping from the sidelines. And he cannot say how he will pay for a “green spending spree” which will just mean taxes going up.\n\n\n\n 10.23am GMT \n\nQ: When you said you would stop the boats, people thought that meant reducing them to negligble numbers. That is not going to happen, is it?\nSunak says he is proud of the progress he has made. He always said it would be difficult.\nLast year numbers went down by a third. Legal enforcement rates have gone up by 70%. He says 20,000 people have been returned.\nBut the only solution is to have a deterrent. That is working with Albania, where people are being returned and the numbers of people coming are down by 90%.\nHe says the alternative is going back to square one. Labour has offered no alternatives. And Keir Starmer says he would scrap the Rwanda plan even if it was working.\n\nUpdated at 10.23am GMT\n\n\n 10.20am GMT \n\nQ: Given your party is still criticising you, is it time for you to tell them to shut up?\nSunak says his party came together yesterday on the bill.\nHis plan is working, he says. Look at what is happening on inflation – it has been halved, down from 11% to 4%. \nHe says, as a result, he could deliver tax cuts.\nThe alternative is going back to square one, he says.\n\n\n\n 10.18am GMT \nRishi Sunak says Tory party has 'come together' over Rwanda bill and he challenges Labour to back it in Lords\n\nRishi Sunak is holding his press conference.\nHe says the Conservative party has now “come together” over the Rwanda bill.\nIt has passed the Commons unamended, he says.\nIt is now time for the Lords to pass it, he says. He goes on:\n\nThere is now only one question. Will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected House? Or will they get on board and do the right thing? It’s as simple as that.\n\nUPDATE: Sunak said:\n\nThe Conservative party last night demonstrated that they are completely united in wanting to stop the boats.

And he said many of the lawyers sitting in the Lords would view the bill as “a step too far”.\nHe told the programme:\n\nMany of us in the House of Lords believe that … good policymaking and the integrity of our legal system are under attack because of internal political quarrelling in the Conservative party …\nWhat we are doing is trying to countermand meddling by politicians in the law.\nIt’s been government elevating itself to an unacceptable level above the law, above our much-admired supreme court, and above the reputation internationally of the United Kingdom law.\nWe’ve seen in various countries the damage that is done when governments use perceived and often ill-judged political imperatives to place themselves above the courts – this is a step towards totalitarianism and an attitude that the United Kingdom usually deprecates.\nI think you’ll find that many of lawyers in the House of Lords will say this is a step too far, this is illegitimate interference by politics with the law, on an issue that can be solved in other ways.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.53am GMT\n\n\n 9.23am GMT \n\nIn an interview with LBC, Chris Philp, the Home Office minister, claimed that Rishi Sunak was in a better position in the light of the Rwanda bill getting a third reading.

Rishi Sunak is holding a press conference this morning. A note alerting political journalists was sent out by No 10 relatively late last night and, as will be the case every time we get a surprise announcement like this in 2024, one kneejerk lobby response was: ‘Is he going to call an election?’ The answer is no. The best evidence for this is probably the latest YouGov polling in the Times today, showing Labour 27 points ahead (but the steer from No 10 says the same).\n\n\nLabour lead up to 27 points in latest YouGov poll for The Times CON 20 (-2) LAB 47 (+2) LIB DEM 8 (-1) REF UK 12 (+2) GREEN 7 (-1) Fieldwork 16 - 17 January pic.twitter.com/ic63LgrCpG— Lara Spirit (@lara_spirit) January 18, 2024\n\n\nInstead, we are expecting Sunak to talk about the Rwanda bill, which cleared the Commons last night by a comfortable margin as the Tory “rebels” largely abandoned their protest and accepted the argument that a “weak” Rwanda bill (in their opinion) was better than no bill at all, the sinking of Sunak’s premiership and a probable early election.\nThere were big revolts on the rebel Tory amendments, but after two days of debates Sunak emerged looking stronger than the “five family” leaders who were threatening to take the bill down. These are from the Scotsman’s Alexander Brown on their apparent capitulation and on Lee Anderson, who resigned as Tory deputy chair on Tuesday, releasing a letter expressing his “100% support” for Sunak almost exactly at the same time as he was voting against the government, but who on Wednesday abstained on the third reading.\n\n\nMy favourite scene in The Godfather is when the five families meet and agree to do whatever the police say https://t.co/0M3GulJ2hv— Alexander Brown (@AlexofBrown) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\"My father made him an offer he could refuse.

Chris Philp, a Home Office minister, was doing an interview round this morning, and he said he expected the bill to pass through the Lords swiftly. He told Times Radio:\n\nIt’s a pretty short bill, which means it should be able to get through the House of Lords fairly fast.\n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\nMorning: Rishi Sunak holds a press conference in Downing Street.\n10am: Peter Sewell, a former manager from Fujitsu, working on the Post Office account, gives evidence to the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry.\n10.30am: Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, takes questions on next week’s business.\nAfter 11.30am: MPs debate the order banning the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.\nNoon: Humza Yousaf takes first minister’s questions at Holyrood.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "The Labour MP and former Foreign Office minister Sir Tony Lloyd, who has died aged 73 of blood cancer, was a popular politician who represented three different constituencies in the Manchester area for a total of 36 years across five decades. He was “Mr Manchester”, a devoted son of the city who spent five years out of parliament as the elected police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Greater Manchester before returning to the Commons in 2017 as the member for Rochdale. He was instilled by his upbringing with a sense of public service and the possibilities offered by politics, once saying: “I have always thought: if not fighting for what is right and just, then what is politics for?” It was an approach that won him trust and admiration from his constituents and widespread respect across all parties in the House of Commons. He was not bothered about the pursuit of personal promotion, but was a well-informed and highly principled pragmatist – an attitude that was reflected in his election as the chair of the Parliamentary Labour party (2006-12). Lloyd had a remarkable record as a busy and effective constituency MP, who also spent two decades on the frontbenches at Westminster and was, in addition, a committed internationalist. His new year message in the most recent edition of the Rochdale Observer, published four days before his death, covered events in Gaza, staff morale in the NHS, climate change and education issues in Rochdale. In the last weeks before Christmas in the Commons, he spoke on arms exports to Israel, Rwanda, his concerns about private renting and the use of pre-payment meters. Throughout his life he fought for a better deal for the north-west of England and in particular for Manchester. It was because of his longstanding concern about crime that he resigned as MP for Manchester Central in 2012 to stand successfully in the first election for the city’s PCC. For two years from 2015 he combined this post with that of the interim mayor of Greater Manchester, but was then defeated by Andy Burnham for the Labour candidacy in the first mayoral election in 2017 – a role that subsumed the duties of the PCC. Born in Stretford, Tony was the fourth of five children of Sydney Lloyd, a lithographic printer, and Cecily (nee Boatte), an administrative officer. His father died when he was 13 and Tony’s politics were formed by his mother, who was a Labour activist. He had an aunt who was a Labour county councillor on Humberside and he joined the Labour party at the age of 16.  From Moss Park and Seymour Park primary schools and Stretford grammar school he went on to Nottingham University to take a BSc in mathematics, and Manchester Business School for a diploma in business administration. After working as a trainee accountant he was a lecturer in the department of business administration at Salford University (1979-83). Elected to Trafford metropolitan borough council in 1979, where he was a member until 1984, he became deputy leader of the Labour group. He first entered parliament in the 1983 general election for Stretford, a seat formerly held by the Tory MP Winston Churchill Jr, grandson of the prime minister, who had moved constituencies after boundary changes that benefited Labour. In his maiden speech Lloyd bemoaned the lack of investment by the private sector in his constituency, which he described as one of great vitality but also suffering “tremendous problems”, including 40% unemployment in Moss Side. Further boundary changes abolished the Stretford constituency in 1997, and in the election that year he won Manchester Central, where he stayed until becoming PCC. He had already been re-selected, in 2022, for the next election. The range of Lloyd’s frontbench appointments reflected his evident capabilities. He joined the whips’ office in 1986 and then in 1988 became a spokesman on transport (1988-89), on employment (1988-92; 1993-94) and on education (1992-94). From 1994 he was on the environment team, dealing with local government for a year, and then spent two years as the deputy spokesman on foreign affairs. When Labour took office in 1997, Tony Blair appointed him minister of state at the FCO with responsibility for Africa, the Balkans and Latin America. He lost this post in a reshuffle in the summer of 1999, following criticism by the Commons’ foreign affairs select committee of Britain’s role in the provision of arms during the Sierra Leone civil war. By this time, however, Lloyd – who had not voted for Blair in the leadership election – was also known as a supporter of Gordon Brown in the increasingly hostile division that had grown among the party elite. Lloyd himself was a centre-left loyalist within the party but was always prepared to rebel on issues of principle. He voted against the Blair government on the Iraq war; in opposition to the detention of suspected terrorists without trial; on the imposition of student tuition fees; and on the renewal of the Trident nuclear missile. He voted against the Brown government decision to axe plans for a “super casino” for east Manchester, which he insisted would have brought employment to the city. Between 2002 and 2007, Lloyd led the British delegation to the Council of Europe, of which he was a vice-president, and also to the Western European Union. From 2005 to 2012 he was the leading member of Britain’s representation on the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. When he returned to the Commons in 2017, he was appointed by Jeremy Corbyn as the shadow spokesman on housing and in 2018 he took over as shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland. After the 2019 election, he added shadow Scottish secretary to his brief. He was reappointed to Northern Ireland by Sir Keir Starmer, but he stood down in 2020 to recover from Covid-19, for which he was treated in Manchester Royal Infirmary, spending 10 days in intensive care on a ventilator. He was always an assiduous MP, introducing many private members’ bills in an effort to draw attention to issues with which he was concerned. These included an attempt to ban foreign ownership of the British media; to introduce direct elections to health authorities; to establish a regional assembly in the north-west of England; to allow random road breath-testing; and to reform the leasehold system. He was a member of the select committees on social security (1983-85); home affairs (1985-87); European scrutiny (2010-11); international trade (2021-23) and Northern Ireland (from 2022). For a decade from 2002 he chaired the trade union group of Labour MPs. He was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours in 2021. For the book Men Who Made Labour, published in 2006 to mark the centenary of the adoption of the Labour party name in parliament, he wrote two chapters, on John Robert Clynes and George Kelley, elected as Manchester MPs in 1906. In 1974 he married Judith Tear, who survives him with their children, Angharad, Siobhan, Kieron and Ali, and granddaughters, Carmen and Carys. • Anthony Joseph Lloyd, politician; born 25 February 1950; died 17 January 2024 • This article was amended on 19 January 2024, to correct the name of Seymour Park primary school."

        "content": "The polling expert Prof John Curtice has warned of low turnout at this year’s general election, in part because voters regard Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer to be as “dull as dishwater”. Speaking at an event for the Citizens Advice charity, Curtice cited boring leaders as one of three reasons why the voting numbers would be down. “We have two party leaders, three if you include Ed Davey – none of them enthuse the electorate, none of them is popular, all of them are regarded as dull as dishwater,” he told an online seminar on predictions for the election year. The two other factors likely to suppress turnout were the ideological similarity between Labour and the Conservatives, and opinion polls suggesting Labour will win comfortably, he said. “The difference between the parties is relatively narrow because the Labour party has veered quite strongly back towards the centre, although the Conservatives are trying to create some ideological space between them.” On the polls, Curtice said: “If the opinion polls at least remain where they are, it will be all over bar the shouting. So what’s the point of turning out to vote?” He added: “So you have an election where there isn’t much diversity in the parties, it’s obvious who is going to win, and the parties are extremely boring – that’s not a recipe for high turnout.”   Related: UK general election: find your new constituency – and see how it would have voted in 2019   Curtice said voters needed an impetus to cast their ballots. “If we give people a reason to vote, they’ll turn out, but those [three] circumstances are the very kinds of circumstances that incline people to stay at home.” He said the apparent predictability of the election could change if opinion polls began to narrow, which could boost turnout. A low turnout was unlikely to have an impact on the outcome, he said. “Would it make any difference? Probably not, because it will probably affect supporters of all the parties.” Electoral turnout in the UK peaked in the 1950 general election, at almost 84%. It hovered well above 70% for the rest of the 20th century. In 2001 it slumped to 59.4% when Tony Blair was elected for a second time. It has improved slightly since, reaching 68.8% in 2017 and 67.3% in 2019."

In December the Home Office said in a letter seen by the Guardian that it would halt evictions from asylum accommodation for up to three days while severe weather emergency protocol (Swep) was activated by a local authority. Swep is activated when the Met Office forecasts a temperature of below 0C for a minimum of three nights. In large parts of the UK, Swep has been in place for longer than three days and is expected to remain until the end of the week as temperatures plummet. In London, Swep has been activated for six days and counting. With the three-day pause over, Home Office evictions have resumed despite the subzero temperatures. Tuesday was the coldest January night since 2019. When Swep protocols are in place, councils dispatch outreach workers and open additional emergency housing to increase their capacity to house rough sleepers. Charities have said many of those evicted from Home Office accommodation are struggling to access local authority support for those who are street homeless that they are entitled to, meaning some end up sleeping rough. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “It is horrifying that government is putting vulnerable people at risk by refusing to pause the eviction of asylum seekers from temporary accommodation, despite the continuing freezing temperatures. “The government’s hostile approach to refugees has meant that hundreds of people seeking asylum in London are becoming homeless or sleeping rough on our streets.” One refugee, who has recently been granted leave to remain and has been evicted from his hotel on to freezing streets, said: “It’s very difficult to survive when you’re homeless. I don’t have any solution. I have tried so many councils and so many charities I can’t even remember the names of all of them but none of them have been able to help me. “I’m not working yet because I just got granted refugee status. I find it unbelievable that I’m in this situation. I’ve been sleeping on the night bus. It isn’t really possible to actually sleep that way and I have to change buses. We are human beings and we want to have a voice.” At the New Horizon Youth Centre in King’s Cross in north London, a youth homelessness charity for 16- to 25-year-olds, 15 people who had been evicted from Home Office accommodation approached the centre for help on Wednesday morning. Most managed to stay in emergency accommodation provided by the local council but two young people slept on the streets as temperatures in the capital fell to -3C. Phil Kerry, the chief executive of New Horizon Youth Centre, said: “The Home Office decision to pause evictions for up to, but not more than, three days during the severe weather just as we are experiencing is as incredible as it is devastating. Such a commitment is, in effect, an admission from officials that those leaving asylum hotels are ending up on the streets, and to allow it in this extreme weather is frankly unbelievable.” Kerry added that during the first seven days of the centre being open this year, 187 people had approached the charity for support, 43% of whom were refugees. Madeleine Evans, the general manager at Haringey Migrant Support Centre, said: “Evicting refugees, or anyone else, during this cold weather is completely irresponsible and puts lives at risk. After surviving so much, it is heartbreaking to see people we work with once again fearing for their safety. Unprecedented numbers of our visitors are facing street homelessness. Support services are at breaking point and shelters are full.” Other refugee non-governmental organisations said some of the staff managing hotels on behalf of the Home Office were unclear about what the eviction policy was during the cold weather. Leyla Williams, of the charity West London Welcome, said: “This policy, which could leave some people sleeping outside in sub-zero temperatures, could literally be the difference between life and death.” Alexia Murphy, the interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Depaul UK, said: “It’s undeniably shameful that the Home Office is evicting asylum accommodation leavers on to the streets while local authorities are trying to provide emergency accommodation because it’s so cold people sleeping rough are at risk of death. “We need the Home Office to immediately stop evictions and work with local authorities and homelessness charities, like Depaul UK, to end this crisis now. No one should be left to die in the cold.” A government spokesperson said: “We take the welfare and safety of newly recognised refugees seriously and they can obtain support from Migrant Help and their partners when moving on from asylum support accommodation. “We are working closely with local authorities to manage asylum decisions, and to provide additional support for those due to move on in the time frame that the severe weather emergency protocol is active and who may not have alternative accommodation in place.”"

It has condemned the new guidance being issued to officials about injunctions from the European court of human rights.\nRwanda’s President Paul Kagame has said he will return UK taxpayers’ money if no asylum seekers arrive. The UK has paid £240m to Rwanda, with a further £50m to come. No asylum seekers have so far been sent to the country. Kagame added efforts to implement asylum plan cannot “drag on”.\nLabour has said the UK should quickly take up Rwanda’s president on his offer to return money spent on deportation scheme.\nRobert Jenrick’s amendment was defeated, but it saw 61 Conservative rebels back it. Yesterday, 60 Tories backed Sir Bill Cash’s amendment.\nPeers have said it’s too early to know if Rwanda has made changes needed to address supreme court’s deportation concerns.\nDavid Cameron has denied Rwanda bill makes UK an embarrassment on world stage. He made the comments during a Q&A at Davos.\nSuella Braverman strongly attacked ECHR, prompting claims from opposition MPs she’s campaigning for Tory leadership.\nLabour condemned No 10 for saying it will allocate more judges to asylum cases when rape victims wait years for trials to start.\nKeir Starmer led tributes to the Labour MP Tony Lloyd who has died, paying tribute to his “desire to make the world a better, fairer place”.\nThe UK government says it’s seeking costs from Scottish government to pay legal fees from gender bill challenge.\nEarlier at PMQs Keir Starmer labelled Rwanda plan a “farce” and said spending £400m on a removals problem that does not remove anyone is not a plan.\nPlans to change the Whitehall code of conduct to facilitate Rwanda deportations has been dismissed as “madness” by Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants.\nIllegal migration minister Michael Tomlinson claims Rwanda policy will have 94% deterrent effect on small boat crossings.\nConservative former minister Dr Liam Fox has been accused of using a “misogynistic term” when he described SNP MP home affairs spokeswoman Alison Thewliss’s speech as “hysterical”.\n\n\n\n\n 10.42pm GMT \n\nHere is the moment the results of the votes on the government’s Rwanda bill are announced. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.56pm GMT \n\nBack to the Rwanda Bill vote.\nThe division list showed 11 Conservative MPs rebelled to vote against the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill at third reading, PA News reports.\nThey were: Suella Braverman (Fareham), William Cash (Stone), Miriam Cates (Penistone and Stocksbridge), Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland), Sarah Dines (Derbyshire Dales), James Duddridge (Rochford and Southend East), Mark Francois (Rayleigh and Wickford), Andrea Jenkyns (Morley and Outwood), Robert Jenrick (Newark), David Jones (Clwyd West), Danny Kruger (Devizes).\nYou can find more information here.\n\nUpdated at 9.57pm GMT\n\n\n 9.51pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak has survived a damaging row over his flagship Rwanda bill after a Conservative rebellion melted away as dozens of rightwing MPs baulked at further undermining the prime minister’s authority.\nAfter a crucial 11th hour meeting of more than 45 Tory rebels, the group’s leaders concluded that defeating the bill by voting alongside Labour during an election year could risk collapsing the government.\nJust 11 Conservative hardliners , including the former home secretary Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, voted against the legislation, which passed by 320 votes to 276, a majority of 44.\nThere was relief in Downing Street that after days of chaos and infighting at Westminster, during which dozens of Tories rebelled to support amendments to try to toughen up the legislation, the bill has eventually passed its final Commons hurdle.\nSunak now faces further bruising battles with peers who are already threatening to amend the Rwanda deportation plan in the House of Lords to make sure that it complies with international law.\nRead the full report here. \n\n Related: Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda deportation bill passes third reading in Commons  \n\n\n\n\n 9.47pm GMT \n\nThe good news for Rishi Sunak is that, as widely predicted, his Rwanda bill passed the Commons with relative ease. But in keeping with the curse faced by so many recent Conservative prime ministers, getting what he wants could be just the start of his troubles.\nThere is one very important point to make first. However tricky things may get implementing the measure, if Sunak had become the first prime minister since 1977 to lose a bill on third reading it would have been disastrous, even politically terminal for him. So he will be pleased.\nThis is, of course, is all relative. An authoritative prime minister in a strong position would not expect to see 60 MPs rebel to try to amend a flagship policy, as happened on Tuesday, let alone have to wait for the same MPs to largely back down to guarantee the bill’s progress the following day.\nAs has been the case throughout the genesis of the Rwanda deportation scheme, one bequeathed to a reportedly sceptical Sunak by Boris Johnson, via Liz Truss, it is now hard to say whether he will face more problems being able to implement the scheme or having it blocked again.\nHe could see the Lords try to derail the bill, or at least delay it, with the latter seen as the more likely option, even among potential rebels in the upper house. If it is passed, the unilateral declaration that Rwanda is a safe country to which asylum seekers can be deported will then almost certainly face a renewed judicial test.\nThis route would allow Sunak and his ministers to hit out at “lefty lawyers” and “unelected peers” – but actual voters, already deeply sceptical of the Rwanda plan, might focus instead on the potentially broken promise to have the first planes leave by spring.\nAnd if the Lords does back down, and the bill proves legally watertight? That leaves Sunak having to enact a policy that could appear notably more inhumane once it involves real people who have fled real trauma, rather than a mass of unnamed “illegal migrants”.\nMost crucially, Sunak has bet almost all his remaining political credibility on a rush of flights to Rwanda having an immediate and noticeable impact on the flow of unofficial small boat crossings over the Channel, something few outsiders believe is realistic.\nRead the full analysis here. \n\n Related: The Rwanda bill passing could be just the start of Sunak’s troubles \n\n\n\n\n 9.36pm GMT \n\n\n\nBREAKING: Rishi Sunak's flagship Rwanda deportation bill passes its final Commons hurdle by 320 votes to 276, majority 44.— Pippa Crerar (@PippaCrerar) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.33pm GMT \nRwanda bill is approved\n\nThe third reading of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill passed by 320 votes to 276, a majority of 44.\n\nUpdated at 9.34pm GMT\n\n\n 9.28pm GMT \nTory former minister Liam Fox accused of using 'misogynistic term'\n\nConservative former minister Dr Liam Fox has been accused of using a “misogynistic term” when he described an SNP MP’s speech as hysterical.\nDr Liam Fox faced criticism for the remark in the Commons, which he made as he told MPs: “It is very clear from the debate and the last couple of days that it is this side and this side only that understands the concept of deterrence when it comes to...”\nSNP home affairs spokeswoman Alison Thewliss could be heard to shout as Dr Fox spoke, and the senior Conservative interrupted his opening words to respond: “She has had her hysterical say. I will have mine.”\nThe SNP frontbencher shouted back: “Misogynist!”\nMs Thewliss had claimed in her speech that the Government “has become the criminal gang, breaking international law, moving vulnerable people across the world without legal process, no right of appeal, no concern for the safety or human rights of asylum seekers, to a country they do not know, involving money and involving profit”.\nFleur Anderson, the Labour MP for Putney, later criticised Dr Fox, telling MPs: \n\nI also am shocked to hear a member calling another member - a female member - hysterical. It is a classic callout of misogynistic term and I am shocked to hear it.\n\n\n\n\n 9.22pm GMT \n\nEarlier, Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn said the Bill is an “appalling piece of legislation” that “fails to take into account the human suffering of people forced through lack of any other alternative try to make a very dangerous crossing across the channel”.\n\n\n\n 9.21pm GMT \n\nThe result of the vote is expected at 9.30pm. \n\n\n\n 9.20pm GMT \nMPs vote on Rwanda bill\n\nThe Commons has divided to vote on a motion to approve the Safety of Rwanda Bill. \n\nUpdated at 9.23pm GMT\n\n\n 9.13pm GMT \n\nLabour’s Jess Phillips has said: “I stand here to say that I want everybody in here to know that they are about to vote for a Bill they have absolutely no idea how much it’s going to cost.”\nShe added:\n\nPeople who think that the amount of time spent on wasting taxpayers’ money on something that hasn’t worked the last two times…and it will not work this time, frankly, Mr Speaker should be ashamed of themselves for voting for something which they don’t have any idea how much it’s going to cost the people in their constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n 9.00pm GMT \n61 Tory MPs backed Jenrick's Amendment 23\n\nMore on the vote on Jenrick’s Amendment 23.\nAccording to the division list, 61 Conservative MPs backed it, making it the largest Tory rebellion of the Rwanda Bill so far.\nYesterday, 60 Tories backed Sir Bill Cash’s amendment.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.57pm GMT \n\nConservative MP Sir William Cash has said he will be voting against the Rwanda Bill on third reading.\nSpeaking in the Commons, he said:\n\nI want this Bill to succeed and the sole reason I shall be voting against this Bill will be because, on third reading, I don’t believe - to use the Home Secretary’s own words - that this is the toughest immigration legislation that we could produce, nor do I think we’ve done whatever it takes.\n\nHe added: \n\nI wish the Government well, but I do have to say that I can’t support this in all conscience because I’ve set out my case and I’m not going to retract it on principle.\n\n\n\n\n 8.47pm GMT \n\n\n\nNEW: Labour confirms that Keir Starmer has written to cabinet secretary Simon Case to start access talks as per @AnushkaAsthana. The process is expected to begin before the end of this month.— Pippa Crerar (@PippaCrerar) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.36pm GMT \n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has criticised the Tory “chaos and carnage”. \nShe said: \n\nThe only thing the Tories all seem to agree on is that the scheme is failing…the prime minister is failing and they know it.\n\nShe added Sunak’s authority was “in tatters”. \n“He’s in office but not in power,” she said. \n\n\n\n 8.32pm GMT \n\nHome secretary James Cleverly is now on the floor. He has said the government will do “whatever it takes to stop the boats”. \nHe added: “This Bill has been meticulously drafted to end the merry-go-round of legal challenges.” \nA questioner asks: “Can the home secretary confirm that if this bill receives royal assent, that it will not breach international law? \nCleverly responded: “As drafted, as we intend this Bill to progress, it will comply completely with international law.” \n\n\n\n 8.20pm GMT \n\nMPs voted 338 to 264, a majority 74, to reject a Labour amendment that sought to require the Government to report to Parliament if a person previously relocated to Rwanda had been returned to the UK due to being involved in serious crime.\n\n\n\n 8.04pm GMT \n\nThe vote on a motion that Clauses 9 and 10 “stand part” of the Safety of Rwanda Bill was backed 340 to 264. A majority of 76. The clauses set out the title of the Bill, and state that it will come into force on the same day the UK’s treaty with Rwanda does.\n\nUpdated at 8.07pm GMT\n\n\n 7.53pm GMT \n\nITV’s Anushka Asthana has said that Keir Starmer has written to cabinet secretary Simon Case to start Labour’s “access talks” with the civil service to start preparations for a possible change in government.\n\n\nEXC: ITV News understands that in the last hour Keir Starmer has written to Cabinet secretary Simon Case to start Labour's \"access talks\" with civil service.

This requires the publication of a full impact assessment on the costs involved in removal to Rwanda before the Bill comes into force. This was rejected by 339 votes to 263. A majority of 76.\n\n\n\n 7.40pm GMT \n\nNext vote was on a motion that clauses 5, 6, 7 and 8 “stand part” of the safety of Rwanda bill. They were backed 340 to 263, a majority of 77.\nThese clauses include measures which insist it is for ministers to decide when they will comply with interim measures from the Strasbourg court.\n\nUpdated at 7.50pm GMT\n\n\n 7.29pm GMT \nJenrick amendment rejected\n\nAmendment 23 from Robert Jenrick, seeking to block last-minute injunctions from European judges has been rejected 536 to 65, a majority of 471.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.14pm GMT\n\n\n 7.26pm GMT \n\nA final tranche from Tomlinson’s speech earlier in which he said the government “will not stop” in its bid to see planes take off for Rwanda.\n\nThat is why we have inserted into clause five of this bill, which is crystal clear that it is for ministers and ministers alone to decide whether to comply with rule 39 injunctions. We would not have inserted clause five if we were not prepared to use it.\nAnd I can confirm to the house that we can and will lawfully use that power if the circumstances arise, the discretion is there. But we go further still, and we confirm that the civil service must implement any such decision. Today the permanent secretary for the Home Office has confirmed that if we receive a rule 39, instead of deferring removal immediately, as currently is the practice, officials will refer the rule 39 to the minister … in this case to me, for an immediate decision, as the Cabinet Office has confirmed that is the responsibility of civil servants under the civil service code to deliver that decision.\n… Colleagues have confirmation that we have the power we would use the power and the civil service will give effect to it.\nIf a plane is sitting on that runway, this government will not stop until it takes off. And we all know what the opposition would do. They would campaign for it to be grounded.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.51pm GMT\n\n\n 7.11pm GMT \n\nMore from Michael Tomlinson’s speech earlier:\n\nWhat happened with the Rwanda flight in June 2022 was frustrating as many honourable members have mentioned. It was a deeply flawed process and raised issues of natural justice. But changes have been made since then, not least in the Illegal Migration Act. And since then, the Strasbourg court has announced the outcome of its review into the rules concerning interim measures and the changes include the naming of judges and that interim measures should be communicated as formal decisions, and it confirms existing practice in parties being able to request reconsideration of a decision in the rules and the United Kingdom has responded formally to that court’s consultation.\nThat is why the prime minister has been clear that he will not let a foreign court block these flights. We simply cannot let an international court dictate our border security and stop us from establishing a deterrent.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.52pm GMT\n\n\n 7.10pm GMT \n\nClause 3 “stand part” of the safety of Rwanda bill has been backed 339 to 264. A majority of 75. The clause disapplies elements of human rights law, to ensure that courts defer to parliament’s “sovereign view” that Rwanda is safe.\n\nUpdated at 7.55pm GMT\n\n\n 7.06pm GMT \n\nConservative former minister Robert Jenrick has withdrawn his amendment 11 to the Bill, which aimed to disapply elements of the Human Rights Act in relation to removals to Rwanda.\n\n\n\n 6.57pm GMT \n\nThe immigration minister Michael Tomlinson sought to reassure MPs that rebel amendments were not needed to safeguard against loopholes in the Rwanda plan.\nTomlinson insisted the bill would go further than previous efforts by the government, including those seen through parliament by his predecessor Robert Jenrick, as it “disapplies further elements of the Human Rights Act”.\nTomlinson told MPs: “The effect is that the duty under section 6.1 of the Human Rights Act is disapplied from any public authority, including any court or tribunal that is taking a decision that is based on the duty under clause 2 of the bill to treat the Republic of Rwanda as safe.”\nAddressing Jenrick, the minister added: “The bill, he is right, does not seek to disapply section 4, it does not in fact disapply the declaration of incompatibility provisions in section 4. This is the only substantive remedy against the conclusive presumption that Rwanda is safe.\n“Retaining declarations of incompatibility is important, but of course the final say on this matter will remain rightly with parliament and with the government, because section 4, subsection 6 of the Human Rights Act makes it clear that a declaration cannot affect the operation or the validity of domestic legislation.”\n\nUpdated at 7.54pm GMT\n\n\n 6.36pm GMT \nUK urges west to use frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine’s economy\n\nBritain is ramping up pressure on western governments to use $350bn of frozen Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine’s war-shattered economy, with the foreign secretary, Lord David Cameron, insisting there were legal, moral and political justifications for action.\nCameron said the countries that were backing Ukraine had economies that when combined were 25 times the size of Russia and it was important to make that firepower count.\nSpeaking in Davos, where Ukraine has been high on the agenda at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, the foreign secretary said: “When Putin launched this illegal invasion, the world changed, and we have to change with it and recognise we are in a more dangerous, uncertain and difficult world.\nRead the full report here.\n\n Related: UK urges west to use frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine’s economy \n\n\n\n\n 6.34pm GMT \n\nSir Robert Buckland, the Conservative former justice secretary who belongs to the One Nation faction in the party, was on Andrew Marr’s LBC show this afternoon where he was asked if he had a message for the Tory rebels. He replied:\n\nI do understand that in politics, you can’t necessarily have everything of what you want. And my advice to colleagues and friends on the other side of the argument is, remember that what they’re doing isn’t achievable. Certainly, they haven’t got the votes for it. And they are probably better off settling for what the government has proposed.\n\nHe also said he did not expect large numbers of people to be deported to Rwanda this year. But he said getting some planes off the ground would be an achievement.\n\nI think if we can see planes going off this year, that will be an achievement. I don’t think scaling it up at this point is likely, but if he can get planes in the air, and a third country can accept asylum seekers, then that’s not just a win for him, it’s also going to be looked at, interestingly, by other European countries.\n\nAt one point this was a common view in the party (partly because people assumed, as soon as the first flight left, the deterrent effect would kick in). But in recent days Tory rebels have started saying just getting just a handful of people deported to Rwanda would not be enough. See, for example, Sir Simon Clarke in his Telegraph article today. He wrote:\n\nAs Robert Jenrick, the former Immigration Minister has observed, it will not be enough for a handful of token flights with a few dozen individuals to go to Rwanda. This policy can only exercise the necessary deterrent effect if people who come to this country are detained and removed as a matter of course. That is not what this legislation will deliver.\n\nThat’s all from me for today. My colleague Jane Clinton is now taking over.\n\n\n\n 6.18pm GMT \nThreat of significant Tory rebellion over Rwanda bill recedes with only 'small number' reported to be voting against it\n\nTory rebels are now admitting that only a handful of their number will vote against the Rwanda bill at third reading, according to reporters who have been covering their meeting in the Commons this afternoon. (The MPs meet in private, but sometimes they talk to reporters on the way out.)\nThis is from Aubrey Allegretti from the Times.\n\n\nRebellion has melted away🚨Rebel source says a “small number” of MPs will vote against the Rwanda bill at third reading.They say the “overwhelming likelihood is the bill will pass quite comfortably”They say this isn’t the end of the matter and if the Lords weaken the bill,…— Aubrey Allegretti (@breeallegretti) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\nRebellion has melted away Rebel source says a “small number” of MPs will vote against the Rwanda bill at third reading.

(See 4.45pm.) Garry Graham, the union’s deputy general secretary, said:\n\nThis in effect could put civil servants in an impossible position where the choice is potentially between breaking international law, disobeying the instructions of a minister (and facing potential disciplinary action) or resigning.\nThis is a problem of the governments own making and they should not be putting civil servants in this invidious position.\n\n\n\n\n 5.41pm GMT \nPeers say it's too early to know Rwanda has made changes needed to address supreme court's deportation concerns\n\nIf the Rwanda bill passes the Commons tonight, it will then go to the House of Lords where there is more chance of it being amended, partly because the government does not have a majority there and partly because the chamber is full of lawyers who take safeguarding rights particularly seriously.\nThis afternoon the Lords international agreements committee has published its verdict on the government’s new treaty with Rwanda which is the basis for the declaration in the bill that Rwanda is a safe country for refugees, and it is sceptical. The committee says the government should delay ratifying the treaty with Rwanda until it is satisfied that Rwanda has addressed the problems with its asylum system highlighted by the supreme court.\nThe report says:\n\nOn paper the Rwanda treaty improves the protections previously set out in the memorandum of understanding [the original basis of the UK’s deal with Rwanda, with less legal standing than a treaty], but there are a significant number of legal and practical steps which need to be taken before the protections could be deemed operational such that they might make a difference to the assessment reached by the supreme court. Evidence that these arrangements have bedded down in practice is also needed. In short, the treaty is unlikely to change the position in Rwanda in the short to medium term.\nWe recommend that the treaty is not ratified until parliament is satisfied that the protections it provides have been fully implemented since parliament is being asked to make a judgment, based on the treaty, about whether Rwanda is safe. The government should submit further information to parliament to confirm that all the necessary legal and practical steps and training which underpin the protections provided in the treaty have been put in place, and then allow for a further debate before proceeding to ratification.\n\nIn paragraph 45 of its report, the committee identifies 10 improvements Rwanda is supposed to be making under the treaty and it says it will “take time” for them to happen. They include “a new asylum law in Rwanda; a system for ensuring that non-refoulement does not take place; a process for submitting individual complaints to the monitoring committee; training for international judges in Rwandan law and practice; and training for Rwandan officials dealing with asylum applicants”.\nThe committee says:\n\nIt is clear from this that significant legal and practical steps have to be taken before the assurances provided in the Rwanda treaty can be fully implemented.

He was responding to a separate letter from Darren Tierney, head of propriety at the Cabinet Office, who has produced draft guidance on this topic for all civil servants. The draft guidance says:\n\nAs a matter of UK law, the decision as to whether to comply with a rule 39 indication is a decision for a minister of the crown. Parliament has legislated to grant ministers this discretion. The implications of such a decision in respect of the UK’s international obligations are a matter for ministers. In the event that the minister, having received policy, operational and legal advice on the specific facts of that case, decides not to comply with a rule 39 indication, it is the responsibility of civil servants – operating under the civil service code – to implement that decision. This applies to all civil servants.\n\nThis guidance will be issued if the Rwanda bill becomes law.\nThis wording skirts over the issue of whether it would be lawful for a minister to ignore a rule 39 order. In the Commons this afternoon Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, said the attorney general’s view was that ignoring the Strasbourg court like this would be unlawful.

In a statement she said:\n\nIf Rwanda says we can have the money back from this failing scheme, Rishi Sunak should seize the chance, instead of dragging out this Tory asylum chaos any longer. We need proper grip not more of this failing gimmick.\nThe taxpayer is being hit for more than £400m for a scheme that is only likely to cover 1% of those arriving. That money could go instead into strengthening our border security, including Labour’s plan to crackdown on the criminal smuggler gangs with cross-border law enforcement and establish a major new returns unit.\n\nBut the Rwandan government seems to be having second thoughts. In a clarification of Kagame’s comment, Yolande Makolo, the Rwandan government’s spokesperson, said they would consider a future UK request for a refund, but declined to say how much of the UK’s cash has been spent so far. She said:\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Rwanda has no obligation to return any of the funds paid. However, if no migrants come to Rwanda under the scheme, and the UK government wishes to request a refund of the portion of the funding allocated to support the migrants, we will consider this request.\nTo talk about figures at this point is premature, as we are still awaiting the conclusion of the UK legislative process and remain committed to making the partnership work.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.23pm GMT\n\n\n 3.59pm GMT \n\nJoelle Grogan, a researcher from the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, has posted a useful thread on X on European court of human rights injunctions, which are the main topic of the Rwanda bill debate this afternoon.\nShe says they are issued against the UK only quite rarely (about twice a year) and only when there is a “real risk of serious and irreversible harm”.\n\n\nQuick fact check here on BBC reporting of rule 39 orders.The one order preventing removal of one person to Rwanda was issued 7.35pm UK time, and government were told before.Bit early for pjs.ECHR press release: https://t.co/jBtnPFLOUT https://t.co/ZYEmfYRozy pic.twitter.com/E3RKYgoXhb— Dr Joelle Grogan (@JoelleGrogan) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\nBut are they often issued against the UK?Not really.

Since being sacked, she has often strongly criticised the government’s policy on immigration and small boats.\nShe says the bill as drafted will lead to a re-run of what happened in the summer of 2022 when a plane was blocked from leaving for Rwanda by an injunction from the European court of human rights.\nShe says these injunctions were not part of the original European convention of human rights. They were invented by the court, as part of the process by which it has expanded its remit.\nAnd she says Labour’s Human Rights Act has made the situation worse. It has encouraged a rights culture, and decisions by the government has been undermined by an activist legal industry.\nAs an example, she cites the case of a Nigerian national sentenced in 2016 to four years in jail for serious offences, including battery and assault. But an attempt to deport him was blocked on the grounds that he would face serious problems integrating in Nigeria, and those concerns outweighed the public interest in deportation, Braverman says.\nShe cites another case where a drug dealer was not deported because he would lose ongoing access to medical treatment he was receiving.\nAnd she claims that another case has established that, if the government wants to deport someone, it has to show that their life will not be shortened by the removal of their access to NHS facilities.\nAs Braverman condemns the ECHR as a “foreign court”, Labour’s Stella Creasy asks, if the ECHR is a foreign court, what is Nato?\nBraverman claims that’s “elementary politics”. She says the court does not have the UK’s interests at heart.\nPatrick Grady from the SNP follows Braverman and he starts by telling MPs they have seen “the first act of the next Conservative leadership contest”.\n\nUpdated at 4.10pm GMT\n\n\n 3.20pm GMT \nCameron denies Rwanda bill makes UK an embarrassment on world stage during Q&A at Davos\n\nDavid Cameron has rejected suggestions that the controversy about the Rwanda bill is embarrassing for the UK on the world stage.\nWhen this was put to him at a panel at Davos, the foreign secretary replied: “Quite the contrary.”\nHe said countries around the world were having to find a way of dealing with illegal migration and that, although Britain’s approach was “quite unorthodox in some ways”, out-of-the-box thinking like this was necessary to break the model of this “appalling people smuggling”.\nGraeme Wearden has more on this here on his business live blog.\n\n\n\n 3.12pm GMT \nUK government says it's seeking costs from Scottish government to pay legal fees from gender bill challenge\n\nThe UK Government will seek costs from the Scottish government over the gender recognition bill court challenge, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has confirmed.\nJack’s use of section 35 of the Scotland Act – the first in the history of devolution – to veto the controversial bill, which was passed by a majority at Holyrood – was challenged by the Scottish government at the court of session, which ruled it was lawful last December.\nThe bill would have made Scotland the first country in the UK to introduce a self-identification system for people who want to change their legally recognised sex.\nJack said he has told Scottish ministers that a motion for the award of expenses will be lodged on Friday.\nAfter the court of sessions’ judgment, Scottish ministers announced they would ditch their legal action against the Westminster’s block, while challenging a future Labour government to allow it to become law by lifting the veto.\nToday Jack said:\n\nThe Scottish government chose to pursue this litigation in spite of the cost to the taxpayer.

He says:\n\nThe Home Office has demonstrated time and again that it is either unwilling or unable to grapple with the scale of the challenge facing it, and to that extent I believe it is time that it is relieved of the responsibility of policing our borders and instead the issue is handed to the Ministry of Defence. This is after all a defence of the realm matter and we need British boots on the ground.\nOur borders must be stronger, and in order to achieve that we must explore negotiating with our continental neighbours, pointing out that they would regain control of their overrun towns from Dunkirk to Boulogne if they allow that, in addition to the people we already have in their command and control centres, we put British boots on the ground in northern France to assist their efforts.\n\nThe statement says Watling will be supporting the government in votes on the bill – even though he does not think the legislation goes far enough and believes “it will not ultimately succeed in full”. Even with the amendments proposed by Tory MPs, it would not go far enough, Watling says – which (rather confusingly) he cites as a reason for not supporting the amendments.\n\nUpdated at 2.40pm GMT\n\n\n 2.24pm GMT \n\nSir Bob Neill, chair of the Commons justice committee, tells the Commons that he thinks the amendments attacking the European court of human rights’s use of injunctions are misplaced.

But she is mostly talking about legal principle, and she says the bill is anathema to the Scottish legal tradition.\nSome Tories have defended the Rwanda policy, despite what international law says, on the grounds that parliament is supreme.\nBut Cherry says the principle of unlimited sovereignty of parliament is an English principle, with no counterpart in Scottish law. In Scotland sovereignty lies with the people, and there is an acceptance that executive power should not go unchecked. She says this goes back as far as the Declaration of Arbroath.\nCherry has put her name to six amendments to the bill (two with fellow SNP MP Patrick Grady, four of her own) and she says these are designed to ensure that the bill does not apply to Scotland, and that Scottish asylum seekers continue to enjoy the same fundamental rights as other people.\n\n\n\n 1.57pm GMT \nFormer Tory attorney general expresses concern Rwanda bill would let UK decide for itself if it's breaking international law\n\nSir Jeremy Wright, the Conservative former culture secretary, who was also attorney general between 2014 and 2018, has tabled two amendments to the bill and he is speaking now.\nHe says his amendments would remove from the bill passages that imply parliament has the right to decide whether or not the UK is in compliance with international law.\nHe says it would be a mistake for the government to imply that international law does not matter. He points out that only two days ago the government was justifying the airstrikes against the Houthis on the grounds that their attacks on shipping were against international law. And he says the UK would not want to leave it up to the Houthis to decide whether or not they were complying with international law.\nUPDATE: Wright said:\n\nWhat [the government] cannot properly do is set themselves up as judge in their own cause on questions of international law. This house would be wrong to pass a bill that suggested that they could. That is really where my amendments are focused.\nAs I say, there is a good practical reason why we should be nervous about this: because we do sometimes rely on international law to discharge our own policy intents and purposes. Not more than 48 hours ago in this place, we were doing exactly that. We were saying that it is important to criticise the actions of the Houthis in the Red sea because they contravene principles of international law. We were saying too that we justify our own response to that because it is in accordance with the principles of international law, and quite right, too. We would not have accepted the Houthis’ unilateral declaration that they were in compliance with international law when they did what they did, nor should we have, and we would not of course accept a Russian legislative Act to say that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was in compliance with Russia’s international law responsibilities.\nLet me make it clear that I am not, of course, suggesting that what the government have in mind here is in any way comparable to those two examples, but it seems that the point here is that to arrogate to oneself the right to declare one’s own compliance with international law runs the risk of, first, other states finding comfort in our example and, secondly, undermining our own messages in other situations.

He said:\n\nDoes the prime minister know that under his leadership and on his watch the crown court backlog in this country is at a record high of 65,000, victims of serious crime regularly are waiting more than two years for their day in court so they can seek justice against their perpetrator?\nA completely and utterly broken system due to 14 years of Tory incompetence and indifference, and yet the prime minister clicks his fingers and is glibly apparently able to magic up 150 judges and 1,000 staff …\nRegardless of the operation issues, just imagine the impact the prime minister’s glib announcement yesterday would have on you if you were the victim of rape who has been languishing for years in our broken judicial system.\nJust imagine the anger and disgust you would feel at the spectacle of a Conservative prime minister sacrificing your fight for justice on the altar of his desperate attempt to cling to power by appeasing his backbenchers.

But that was not the norm, he said, and he told MPs that if the bill is passed unamended, the government would end up having deportation flights blocked, as happened in 2022.\nUPDATE: Jenrick said:\n\nThe attorney general and the government legal service, as far as I am aware, continue to advise ministers and civil servants that a decision not to support a rule 39 interim measure would be illegal and would be in breach on the ministerial code.\nIn fact my best recollection of that was that no minister should give any indication that they would ignore a rule 39 interim measure. The attorney general’s position as I understand it is that there is a very small number of cases in which it is conceivable that one could do so.\nBut that is a vanishingly slim number of cases and situations.

There can’t be anyone in CCHQ who thinks that now. For the second week in a row, Keir Starmer merrily ran amok on the issue, leaving Rishi Sunak floundering. In one respect it is another example of the Tories suffering from “long Boris” – because the Rwanda policy wheeze was dreamed up under his watch.\nStarmer was particularly effective today for two reasons. First, he repeatedly challenged Sunak to answer a question he was dodging (how many people earmarked for deportation to Rwanda had been “lost” by the Home Office). Starmer does not regularly use this tactic, but it works well, as it did today. But the main strength of his approach was just the polish with which he ridiculed Sunak. Here’s a flavour of it.\n\nSpending £400m on a plan not to get anybody to Rwanda whilst losing 4,000 people is not a plan, it’s a farce. Only this government can waste hundreds of millions of pounds on a removals policy that doesn’t remove anyone.\nOnly this government could claim that it’s going to get flights off the ground only to discover they couldn’t find a plane. Only this government could sign a removal deal with Rwanda only to end up taking people from Rwanda to here.\n\nThe only relatively novel feature of Sunak’s response was to attack Starmer for having drafted a human rights legal textbook before he became an MP. The Conservative party seems to be working overtime at the moment to find episodes from Starmer’s legal past that supposedly discredit him, but none of them seem to be working, and this one certainly didn’t.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.40pm GMT\n\n\n 12.41pm GMT \n\nIan Mearns (Lab) ask for funding for the Tyne Bridge restortion.\nSunak says the government is investing to level up.\n\n\n\n 12.40pm GMT \n\nIan Levy (Con) asks if the government will continue to focus on the rebirth of towns like his own, Blyth.\nSunak confirms that.

Will Sunak ensure it at least reaches Euston. Or is Sunak just interested in private jets.\nSunak says Starmer might have something to say about private jets. He says Old Oak Common will be one of the most important stations in the country. But the government does intend to go ahead with the HS2 Euston link.\n\n\n\n 12.27pm GMT \n\nChris Stephens (SNP) asks about the contaminated blood scandal, and says a compensation scheme should be set up urgently. When will victims be paid?\nSunak says he is aware of the strength of feeling on this issue. He says this is a complex issue. Interim payments have been made in some cases. When the final inquiry report is made, the government will respond as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n 12.25pm GMT \n\nPatrick Grady (SNP) asks what is wrong with Rwanda that makes the government think sending people there will be a deterrent.\nSunak says it’s not that anything is wrong with Rwanda; the point is, it’s not the UK. That is why being sent there would be a deterrent.\n\n\n\n 12.24pm GMT \n\nGreg Smith (Con) asks about overcrowding on Chiltern Railways. He asks if the PM will fast-track plans to improve the service.\nSunak agrees service on the Chiltern network has not been good enough.

Those aren’t her words, but the words of the head of Oxfam. What will it take for the PM to back a permanent, bilateral ceasefire?\nSunak says a ceasefire would be the best way forward. But Hamas would have to agree to release hostages, they would have to no longer by in charge of Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority would have to take over in Gaza.\n\nUpdated at 12.27pm GMT\n\n\n 12.19pm GMT \n\nDean Russell (Con) says he had a heart attack six months ago, but has recovered.

Is it any wonder they are in revolt when the PM doesn’t believe in the policy?\nSunak says it will be news to Starmer that people can believe in something and stick to it. Just this week there was another example, he says. Starmer backed the ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir, he says. But he says in the past Starmer, as a lawyer, worked to stop them being banned.\n\n\n\n 12.11pm GMT \n\nStarmer says Sunak does not know where they are. But we know where they aren’t – Rwanda. The only people going there are ministers. And he says Sunak does not even support the Rwanda policy. The Tories on this are hundreds of bald people scrapping over a comb. Doesn’t Sunak wish he had stuck to his guns?\nSunak quotes experts saying this is the most robust piece of legislation on this ever passed. A former supreme court justice says it will work.

It is a farce. He asks the question again; where are the missing people?\nSunak list things that are happening: more enforcement raids, more bank accounts blocked (both of which using powers Labour opposed), a record number of people returned. That is a plan that is working. Numbers coming to the UK are down by a third. And it is a bit rich to hear Starmer says he would stop the boats. Starmer has “no values, no conviction and no plan”. It is back to square one, he says.\n\nUpdated at 12.29pm GMT\n\n\n 12.06pm GMT \n\nStarmer says he wondered how the government could lose so many people. But then he remembered how bad their record was. They lost people they wanted to deport. So where are they?\nSunak says the government has removed 20,000 people. It is important to have a deterrent, he says. And he says Starmer does not care about solving the problem. He says Starmer told the BBC he would reverse the Rwanda plan even if it were working.\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm GMT\n\n\n 12.05pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer also sends his best wishes to McCartney and his father.\nAnd he says all MPs will want to sent their sympathies to the family of the two-year-old who was found starved to death in Skegness.\nHe asks if the government has found the 4,250 asylum seekers who have absonded.\nSunak says the government’s plan is working.\n\nUpdated at 12.11pm GMT\n\n\n 12.03pm GMT \n\nJason McCarney (Con) says his father has joined the list of people in his constituency with a diagnosis of dementia.

He identifies two main problems with it.\n\nFirst, the fact that the bill only asserts the general safety of Rwanda as a third country, and does not address the provision of individual claims that will inevitably be submitted against removal. The mere fact that the government yesterday announced that 150 judges and courts will be repurposed to assess these claims only confirms the problem that can be anticipated.\nSecond, the bill does not commit to disapplying rule 39 interim injunctions from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. It was one of these that prevented a previous flight to Rwanda from proceeding and it is clear there are many in the government – not just in the civil service but among senior ministers – who believe ignoring such an injunction would place us in breach of international law.\n\nClarke also addresses the argument (made today in a column by Paul Goodman, editor of ConservativeHome, among others) that defeat of the bill at third reading would be bad for the party. Clarke says:\n\nWhat matters is not the doomed pursuit of unity as an end in itself, but delivery of our policy. This is true not simply as a matter of logic and good faith with our constituents, but as a matter of remorseless electoral logic …\nI say this not as somebody with the luxury of a safe shire seat, but who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland - the seat where I was born and grew up, and which I have fought incredibly hard to win back from Labour and to solidify with an 11,000 majority. But all that will be set at nothing if I cannot deliver for my constituents now.\nIf the bill is voted down this evening, there will be one final opportunity for the government to return to parliament with a bill that works, and which can command the support of the whole of the Conservative party.\nWe are sent to parliament to deliver for our constituents, and to act in accordance with our own judgement and, indeed, conscience. If I cannot look my constituents in the eye and say that in my best estimation, this legislation will deliver, then I cannot vote for it.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.49am GMT\n\n\n 11.20am GMT \nPlan to change Whitehall code of conduct to facilitate Rwanda deportations dismissed as 'madness' by civil service union\n\nAs Michael Tomlinson confirmed in interviews this morning (see 9.35am), the government’s latest ploy to assure Tory rebels that it is serious about ignoring European court of human rights’ injunctions banning deportation flights is to suggest that the civil service code will be amended to make it clear that officials can’t use injunctions as a reason to block flights themselves.\nBut this idea has been dismissed as “madness” by Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants. In an interview with Kevin Schofield from HuffPost, Penman said:\n\nThey’re essentially advising civil servants to act illegally, which will put them in conflict between their obligation to uphold the rule of law and to follow their instructions from elected ministers.\nMinisters have an obligation to not put civil servants in that position. This is madness – changing the civil service code does not change the law.\n\n\n\n\n 11.06am GMT \n\nThe Home Office has quietly abandoned plans to get more barges to house asylum seekers, Chloe Chaplain reports in the i. She reports:\n\nMinisters keen to cut the multi-million pound hotel bill for asylum seekers touted the barges as an ideal solution to the need for temporary housing.\nBut after just one was commissioned by the government, officials have put plans to look for more on the backburner, i can reveal.\nThe Government has struggled to find a port willing to take a barge following a battle to get the Bibby Stockholm – an asylum barge located in Dorset – up and running last year.\n\n\n\n\n 10.52am GMT \n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, 15 rebel Conservative MPs have said they are willing to vote against the Rwanda bill at third reading if the government refuses to accept any of the amendments tabled to make it tougher. As well as four MPs who have not gone public, it names: Marco Longhi, Miriam Cates, Nick Fletcher, Robert Jenrick, Sarah Dines, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Simon Clarke, Suella Braverman, Sir John Hayes, Danny Kruger and Jonathan Gullis.\nBut most of these 11 Tories have not said they will definitely vote against the bill. They are still holding out for concessions, and some seem minded to abstain rather than to vote with the opposition.\nRees-Mogg is an example. Although listed as a likely third reading rebel, he told Times Radio this morning he still had not decided what he would do. He said:\n\nLet’s see what happens ... This is all about pushing in the same direction, and the government having a policy that is effective and will work. And if we’re moving in that direction, that’s extremely positive.\nThe truth is, I haven’t decided [how to vote at third reading].\nBut I will decide before the vote comes. But I want the government to succeed. I want this policy to succeed. It’s about helping the government have a policy that will be successful.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.54am GMT\n\n\n 10.39am GMT \n\nJeremy Hunt, the chancellor, also argued this morning that the Conservative party was at least united in intent over the Rwanda policy. He said:\n\nWhen you look at what happened in the House of Commons, you can see that the Conservative party – of course, we have debates about how to get there – but we are the only party that wants to make the Rwanda policy work, wants to have a policy where we are deporting people quickly who arrive here illegally.\nWe are united in the Conservative party in our belief we need to solve this problem.\n\n\n\n\n 10.03am GMT \nIllegal migration minister Michael Tomlinson claims Rwanda policy will have 94% deterrent effect on small boat crossings\n\nAnd here are some more lines from Michael Tomlinson’s interview round this morning.\n\nTomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, said he was confident the Rwanda bill would pass its third reading. “We are not going to be defeated tonight, he said.\n\n\nHe said the Conservatives shared a “unity of purpose” over the Rwanda bill and that disagreements over what should be in it only amounted to an “inch”. He said:\n\n\nWhen we go through the detail of the legislation, yes, there is a difference in emphasis … but in terms of the overall message, the overall desire and aim, every single Conservative speaker yesterday stood up and said that they want this policy to work.\n\nWhen it was put to him that Tory MPs fundamentally disagreed, he replied:\n\nThey don’t fundamentally disagree. There are disagreements of emphasis. There’s an inch between us, there’s a determination to ensure that the policy works.\n\n\nHe claimed that the bill would have a 94% deterrent effect on small boat crossings. In his interview on the Today programme, he claimed the Rwanda policy could have the same impact as the PM’s deal with Albania, which has led to a big increase in returns to Albania. When Mishal Husain insisted the two policies were very different (because Albanians are being returned to their home country), Tomlinson persisted with the analogy. He said the Rwanda policy would “start off with small numbers” and then move into the thousands. He said nearly 6,000 Albanians had been deported. Asked when 6,000 people would be sent to Rwanda, he refused to say. But he went on:\n\n\nWe have seen the deterrent effect working in relation to Albania. Albanians crossing on small boats has reduced not by 90%, not by 93%, but 94% as a result of the measures and the steps that have taken. That is exactly the same principle.\n\nWhen Husain put it to him, again, that the Albanian scheme was very different, Tomlinson insisted the deterrent principle was the same. He went on:\n\nIt’s a different country, it’s the same principle. It is the deterrent principle that is working and that is in effect 94% of those coming from Albania. We will see the same deterrent effect.\n\n\n\nHow long will it take for migrants to be sent to Rwanda if Rishi Sunak's bill gets royal assent?Michael Tomlinson, illegal migration minister, tells @MishalHusain this process will take time and will begin with small numbers of migrants initially.#R4Today— BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) January 17, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.22pm GMT\n\n\n 9.35am GMT \nMinister says Whitehall rules could be changed to confirm ECHR injunctions should not stop Rwanda flights\n\nGood morning. Rishi Sunak faces another difficult day over his Rwanda bill, but it seems much more likely than not that by the time he goes to bed he will have got the legislation through the House of Commons unamended.\nEven CCHQ would find it hard to present that as a triumph. Sixty Conservative MPs opposed the government in one of the votes last night, in the biggest rebellion of Sunak’s premiership, three people resigned from party or government positions, the bill still has to get through the House of Lords, and, even if it does become law, you would have to be very generous to say No 10 has made a convincing case to show that it will work.\nBut getting the bill past third reading in these circumstances would be a lot, lot better than losing and No 10 seem confident they will win the final vote. According to the Commons website, the government has a working majority of 54 and so if 60 Tory MPs were to vote against, or even if all of them just abstained, the majority would vanish. But only around a dozen or so have said they will vote against and most of them are likely to vote with the government (including Lee Anderson, Brendan Clarke-Smith and Stevenson, the three people who resigned yesterday so they could vote in favour of rebel amendments, according to Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt).\nFaced with a choice between a Rwanda bill they believe is too weak, and no Rwanda bill at all, a possible no confidence vote in Sunak (which he would probably win), and an increased chance of an early election, Conservative MPs seem minded to reject the self-destruct option. This is not the way they have always behaved in recent years, and it is why Sunak may conclude that the outcome could be a lot worse. He is likely to feel more satisfied by the end of the day than the hardline, ERG rightwingers who brought down Theresa May’s Brexit deal and said explicitly they wanted to do the same to the Rwanda bill.\nToday MPs will be discussing amendments including the one from Robert Jenrick intended to ensure that the government really does ignore European court of human rights’ injunctions saying deportation flights should not be allowed to take off. Sunak has said in principle he is willing to do this. But he has not given a cast-iron assurance that in all circumstances he would.\nWhy not? Probably because of the attorney general, Victoria Prentis, who has reportedly said that if a minister actually does ignore one of the injunctions (rather than just declaring they might), that would be in breach of international law. And breaking international law is a breach of the ministerial code.\nMichael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, was doing the morning interview round and he offered the Tory rebels an olive branch on this point. He said the government is considering changing the civil service code to say that government can ignore these injunctions, which would mean officials could not ignore them by citing the international law argument. Asked to confirm that was the case, he told the Today programme:\n\nWe are looking at that. What happens at the moment is that civil servants advise, ministers decide, and then our excellent civil servants go on and effect and carry out those policies. But, yes, we are looking to see what can be done to strengthen and reassure.\n\nI will post more on his interviews shortly.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\nNoon: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\nNoon: The Northern Ireland assembly is being recalled because Sinn Féin wants a debate on public sector pay ahead of a planned mass strike tomorrow. But it is expected that a full sitting will not be possible because the DUP, which has been boycotting power sharing for almost two years, will continue to block the election of a speaker.\nAfter 12.45pm: MPs resume their debate on the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill. Up to six hours is set aside for the rest of the committee stage debate, and then – if no amendments are passed – up to another hour is set aside for the third reading debate. So the final vote could be mid-evening.\n1pm: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, takes part in a discussion at Davos with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. Later, at 4.30pm, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, takes part in a discussion on growth. Graeme Wearden is covering all the Davos event on his business live blog.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "One of the difficulties for Rishi Sunak in securing enough votes to pass the Rwanda bill was that the potential rebels – who in the end largely stayed onside for the crucial third reading – came from varied groups within the party, each with different motivations and demands. In trying to keep his divided party together, the prime minister sought to please centrists who do not want the bill to change, veteran Eurosceptics with a deep dislike of the European court of human rights, ambitious MPs positioning themselves for a potential leadership bid, and people who usually do what Boris Johnson suggests. So who are the groups that Sunak and his top team spent the week trying to buy off, and what do they want? New Conservatives Tory MPs elected in 2019 have proved to be a difficult group for the prime minister to control – something whips might not have expected given that many are young, ambitious and have hopes for high office in the future. But this group of MPs mostly in the so-called red wall are those most at risk of losing their seats at the next election, and many are worried that a vote for the Rwanda bill could be used against them by the rightwing Reform UK party at the next election. Their group, named the New Conservatives, has made its presence felt since launching last May. Lee Anderson was hired by Sunak as deputy chair of the party to woo voters whom the prime minister struggles to reach. His resignation on Tuesday, alongside that of fellow 2019-intake MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, was a particular blow to Sunak because it fuelled claims that he does not understand the “red wall”. Neither voted against the bill on Wednesday. The group’s leaders, Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger, were among the 11 Conservatives who rebelled in the third reading. Old Brexiters Many of those involved in the ructions of recent weeks are those who spent years campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, and then to do so on the toughest possible terms. This group has never liked being under the jurisdiction of the European court of human rights and has spearheaded attempts to allow ministers to ignore its rulings. The de facto leader of the group is Bill Cash, who has been an MP since 1984 and led the rebellions against the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s. Cash wrote an amendment that would have set aside Strasbourg rulings on the Rwanda scheme, which lawyers have criticised but which 61 Tories voted for on Tuesday night. Cash and his fellow arch-Brexiter David Jones were among the handful to vote against the bill on Wednesday night.  Former ministers Some of the most well-known names among Tuesday night’s rebels over amendments to the Rwanda bill were those who have held high office in the past and know well what it is like to be on the receiving end of such a rebellion. The former prime minister Liz Truss, the former home secretary Suella Braverman, the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and the former housing secretary Simon Clarke all voted in favour of both amendments on Tuesday; Jenrick wrote one of them himself. While each of these ex-ministers comes at the problem of asylum from a slightly different perspective, one thing unites them: they are all reported to have an eye on the leadership should it become vacant before or after the election. With the Tories on average 18 points behind in the polls, the whips have found it difficult to persuade many of this group to back the current prime minister rather than burnishing their credentials to be the next. Braverman, Clarke and Jenrick all voted against the bill on Wednesday. Boris Johnson loyalists One of the most unwelcome interventions for the prime minister during this week’s debates on the Rwanda bill came from someone not in the Commons at all – the former prime minister Boris Johnson. “This bill must be as legally robust as possible – and the right course is to adopt the amendments,” Johnson tweeted on Monday. His words were heeded by some of his closest parliamentary allies, including Michael Fabricant, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Marco Longhi, but none of them voted against the bill on Wednesday. Many in this group will have expressed deep-seated concerns with the wording of the bill. But they may also have enjoyed watching the man they regard as responsible for Johnson’s downfall squirm. One Nation Part of Rishi Sunak’s problems over the last few days is that he needs to win over both rightwingers and moderates, who are sceptical of the entire premise of the bill and some of whom say they will vote against it in any form. The prime minister’s refusal to accept amendments to the bill has assuaged the concerns of leading members of the One Nation group, including its leader, Damian Green. Some, including Alicia Kearns and Tobias Ellwood, did not vote for the bill at second reading. A few of them said privately they intended to go one step further and vote against it on Wednesday."

        "content": "Labour has formally requested talks with the civil service in preparation for government if the party wins the election, and discussions are expected to start within two weeks. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, wrote to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, to begin the process of access talks, a week after Rishi Sunak gave the go-ahead for them to start. It is understood that the process, through which party officials will discuss with civil servants how they would run a government should they oust the Conservatives after 14 years, is likely to start before the end of the month. The discussions are a routine but a symbolic process before a possible handover of power. A Labour party spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer has today written to the cabinet secretary to begin the access talks process.” The discussions are a necessary step so that an opposition party can step immediately into government if they win an election. The talks must be authorised by the prime minister. For a period in the 2000s, the prime minister would do this in advance of the opening of parliament, meaning they could begin whenever needed. But under David Cameron, that practice ended, and, under Sunak, Downing Street has faced repeated questions in recent weeks about when he would grant permission before an election that could happen as early as spring, although autumn is now seen as more likely. An Institute for Government study of the practice showed that in elections since 1992, access talks began anywhere from 16 months before the election to a matter of weeks. In 2017, they were authorised on the day Theresa May called the election, leaving Labour just 51 days to speak to officials."

        "content": "Unions have condemned a planned change to Whitehall rules meaning civil servants must ignore Strasbourg judgments halting Rwanda deportation flights. Home Office staff removing asylum seekers will be told to implement last-minute injunctions from the European court of human rights (ECHR) only if ordered to do so by a minister, according to official guidance. Three civil service unions say this will mean that senior civil servants and Border Force staff will have to choose between breaking international law, disobeying the instructions of a minister or resigning.  In a further development, the Guardian has learned that the first civil service commissioner, Gisela Stuart, was not consulted about the plans. It would be considered “best practice” for the head of the independent statutory body to be consulted before significant changes to Whitehall rules. Sir Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary in the Home Office, confirmed the change in a published exchange of letters with a senior Cabinet Office mandarin. In the document, he wrote that staff should in future seek approval from ministers if they receive rule 39 indications – so-called “pyjama injunctions” – from Strasbourg. “I can confirm that we shall issue guidance to those involved in removals to Rwanda, and revised guidance to caseworkers,” Rycroft wrote. “This will amend the existing Home Office guidance in relation to removals under the Illegal Migration Act and safety of Rwanda bill that says: ‘Where you have been notified that a R39 indication has been made, you must defer removal immediately.’ “Home Office officials shall proceed with removal if the relevant minister approves that course of action.” The guidance came hours after the minister for countering illegal migration, Michael Tomlinson, said ministers were planning to tweak the civil service code to order officials to follow ministerial decisions. Downing Street sources later downplayed the move as a change to the civil service code, instead saying the government would change guidance.   Related: Rwanda president: efforts to implement asylum plan cannot ‘drag on’   Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said that changing either the code or guidance would not alter the obligations of senior civil servants to work within the law. “Changing guidance or changing the civil service code does not change the facts,” he said. “If the ECHR rules a deportation unlawful, those are the facts of the case. “Ministers are trying to put civil servants in an invidious position by placing them between serving ministers and their professional obligations. It looks as if ministers are trying to avoid leaving the ECHR and are asking civil servants to break the law instead. “What must be remembered, however, is that ministers under their own code have the obligation not to put civil servants in a position where they are in breach of the civil service code.” Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, said: “This latest ruse by ministers is symptomatic of their desperation to keep their unlawful, unworkable and inhumane Rwanda scheme on life support. “In continuing to push the scheme, ministers are acting unlawfully. Now they appear to be trying to force civil servants to do the same.  “PCS will not allow it to stand. Our legal challenge to the Rwanda scheme led to the supreme court declaring the scheme unlawful. We will not hesitate to take further action through the courts to defend our members from this latest attack.” Garry Graham, the deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: “This in effect could put civil servants in an impossible position where the choice is potentially between breaking international law, disobeying the instructions of a minister and facing potential disciplinary action or resigning. “This is a problem of the governments own making and they should not be putting civil servants in this invidious position.” Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer, said plans to amend the civil service code were “obviously a non-starter”. “Civil servants can only advise on the basis of the law, and the government’s advice from the attorney general and [barrister] Sir James Eadie apparently is, rightly, that rule 39 measures must be complied with in order not to breach the UK’s duties under the European court of human rights,” he said. “So it’s not civil servants who make these decisions, and amending the civil service code won’t make any difference.” Rishi Sunak is seeking to win over Tory rebels before Wednesday night’s vote on his Rwanda plan after facing the biggest Conservative revolt of his leadership. Two deputy party chairs and a ministerial aide quit to join the ranks of the Tory rebels in the Commons on Tuesday night. Sixty Conservatives supported changes to the safety of Rwanda bill put forward by the Tory veteran Sir Bill Cash, as rightwingers pushed to ensure UK and international law cannot be used to prevent or delay a person being removed to Rwanda."

        "content": "In a church hall in Westminster, the first meeting of a breakaway group of Conservative MPs took place. Chaos Anonymous. Word had got round and one by one the MPs shuffled in – helping themselves to coffee and biscuits from the greeters – trying not to catch one another’s eye. Come 10am, there were at least 20 derelict Tories in the room. Shame hung heavy in the air. The first sign of something approaching self-awareness.\n“My name’s Rish! and I’m an addict.’\n“Hi Rish!.”\n“I’d like to welcome everyone to this meeting of CA,” Rish! continued. “For those of you who are new here, which seems to be most of you, I would like to remind you that this is an anonymous programme. What you say here, what you see here, let it stay here. Try not to be judgmental. Listen for the similarities, not the differences. Just for today, concentrate on Step One. We came to admit that we were powerless over our addiction to chaos and that our lives had become unmanageable.”\nThere was an awkward silence.\n“OK,” said Rish!. “I’ll share first. I feel desperate. I never wanted to do this Rwanda scheme in the first place. I always knew it was a shit idea that was never going to work. I should have stopped it when I had the chance. I could have ditched it on my first day in office. I need never have made that halfwit Suella home secretary. But now I’m stuck with it. I feel desperate. At rock bottom. I just can’t stop myself from self-destructing.”\n“Thanks for sharing, Rish!” everyone said.\n“My name’s Jimmy D and I’m an addict,” said James C. “I can identify with everything that Rish! says. I also thought the Rwanda plan was completely batshit crazy. That was fine while I was foreign secretary, but now I’m expected to stand up and defend it. My life is in ruins. No one believes a word I say any more. People laugh at me in the streets.”\n“Thanks for sharing, Jimmy D,” said Rish!. “If it’s any consolation I don’t think anyone ever did believe you.”\n“My name’s Lord Big Dave and I’m an addict,” said Lord Big Dave. “I don’t really know why I’m here. I actually think I’m a relatively high functioning politician but people keep telling me that I’m just glib, greedy and totally superficial. That I am responsible for fucking up the country by not paying attention during the Brexit referendum.”\n“Believe them, Lord Big Dave,” the group replied in harmony.\n“My name’s Bill C and I’m an addict. I hate all Germans …”\n“Thanks Bill. We’ve only got an hour,”\n“My name’s Mike T and I’m an addict,” said Mike T, hesitantly. “I thought I was just fine. Then I went on the Today programme and Sky this morning and my life fell apart. I too know that the Rwanda plan isn’t going to work but I’m going to stand up in parliament and make a total idiot of myself by saying that breaking foreign law is what makes Britain great …”\n“Do you mean international law?” asked Jimmy D. Unusually, he had been paying attention when someone else was talking.\n“There’s no difference.”\n“Er … Thanks Mike T. Keep coming back, it works if you work it.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\n“OK,” said Rish! “We’ve now reached that point where we make time for newcomers or those who find it difficult to share.”\n“My name’s Lee A,” said Lee A, beginning to sob loudly. “Tell you the truth, I’m all over the place. A few years ago I was campaigning for Jeremy Corbyn and now I’m a Tory. At least I was this morning. Thing is, once I see a reporter, I just can’t help myself. I just say the first thing that comes into my head. Yesterday, I managed to vote against the Rwanda bill because it won’t work and offered my 100% support by resigning. Now I’m going to vote for it because I know it will not work.”\n“I think you may need more help that we can offer, Lee,” said Jeremy H. “But it’s good to see so many people here. We all share the same intent. The intent to destroy the Tory party by being the worst versions of ourselves. Same time next week?”\nOnwards and sideways. There was a brief interlude of Tory unity during prime minister’s questions. Every Conservative MP had kept their promise not to ask Sunak any difficult questions. Too busy digesting the news that Paul Kagame, the Rwandan president, had more or less decided that the UK was too corrupt and incompetent for his dictatorship to do business with us. He was bored with the whole thing and would happily return the money. Or some of it. Or none of it. What was £400m anyway?\nSo it was left to Keir Starmer to repeatedly press Rish! on the Rwanda plan. It was all pointless, wasn’t it? Performative politics that didn’t even perform. And where were the 4200 people he wanted to deport. He appeared to have lost them. Sunak could only bluster. He hadn’t lost them. He had just hidden them. They would reappear soon. God, Sunak must hate Wednesdays.\nThen we were back to the second day of the committee stage of the Rwanda bill. Groundhog Day. The same people making the same arguments. Robert Jenrick looking increasingly isolated as he bumbled on about Britain’s inalienable right to make laws for the entire world. He talked of trains running out of tracks, roads running out of … road. We had pulled the pin out of the grenade but were too frightened to throw it. So he blew himself up instead. Honest Bob beetled off to nurse his wounds. If he is the future of the Tory party then its future is measured in months.\nLabour’s Stephen Kinnock also reprised his speech from Tuesday. This was a distraction that got out of hand. Something designed to Save Boris during the Partygate scandal that Sunak made the mistake of taking seriously. Now he was planning to co-opt 150 judges and bring the legal system to its knees. We wanted to join Russia and Belarus. Even Rwanda was feeling queasy.\nThen came a long lecture from the former attorney general Jeremy Wright on the obligations of international law. It turned out we could not decide it by ourselves. Nor could we decide if Rwanda had met its obligations. Who knew? Even your average five-year-old has enough awareness to know that reality cannot be whatever you want it to be.\nThis didn’t stop Suella Braverman. She was almost in tears as she relived her profound grief at a plane full of refugees being grounded by lawyers minutes before it was about to take off for Rwanda. Her life was in tatters. She had never met a refugee she didn’t want to deport. Never found a law she didn’t want to break. Her speech was astonishingly poor. Badly argued. Intellectually incoherent. Luckily there was almost no one there to hear it.\nIt all felt a bit tired. Wilted. This was going nowhere. The rebellion looked set to fizzle out. The bill would pass but no one would win. Rish! was hopelessly weakened. The Rwanda plan wouldn’t work. Because it had never been designed to. We were just set for more chaos. More self-destruction. Next week’s meeting of CA should be even better attended."

        "content": "MPs across the political spectrum have paid tribute to the veteran Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd, who has died aged 73. Lloyd’s family said the MP for Rochdale died peacefully on Wednesday morning surrounded by his family, “as was his wish”. Their statement said: “He was working until a few days before his death as his passion was helping others. He devoted his life to serving and making a difference to the lives of those he met, including his constituents, colleagues, friends, and family. “We would like to thank all the dedicated doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants and other hospital staff who have provided him with care, as well as the blood and platelet donors who gave him an extra four years of life.” Lloyd had represented the Greater Manchester region for more than 40 years after entering the Commons at the 1983 general election. Last Thursday, he revealed that he had been receiving chemotherapy for an “aggressive and untreatable” form of blood cancer, and said he wished to spend the time he had left with his family. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, paid tribute to Lloyd’s “desire to make the world a better, fairer place”. “The death of Sir Tony Lloyd today is a terrible loss. I know the entire Labour party, and many beyond the party, join me in sending our deepest condolences to Tony’s wife, Judith, his children, Siobhan, Angharad, Kieron and Ali, and his granddaughters, Carmen and Carys,” he said. “Like them, we will remember his deep commitment to Labour values and his decency. We will always be grateful for his dedication to public life, his devotion to his country and his desire to make the world a better, fairer place. In the Labour party, we will honour his legacy of service to others and his commitment to justice. May he rest in peace.” Lloyd was treated in hospital for 25 days and on life support for 10 days almost four years ago after suffering badly with coronavirus. After he was discharged, he told the Guardian of his frustration that the then Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, insisted that only those physically in the Commons were able to take part in debates, which left him able to fulfil only “90% of his job”. He added: “There’s this recognition that you only have a certain time left … I’m 70, and as such you think, ‘Well, I’m probably not going to be around in x years’ time, so use these years wisely. Use these days wisely.’ That’s probably good advice for us all.” Lloyd held a range of roles within the Labour party, serving as a junior minister for some of Tony Blair’s first term in office, and also in Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition cabinet. His last role was as shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland. He took a break from Westminster in 2012 for five years to serve as Greater Manchester’s police and crime commissioner, for the last two years of which he also took the role of interim Greater Manchester mayor. Soon after his death was announced, Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth tweeted: “So sorry to hear this. Tony did so much and was a hugely influential and respected figure in the Labour movement. My deepest condolences, RIP.” The shadow minister for Latin America and the Caribbean, Anna McMorrin, added: “So very sorry for your loss. A wonderful and kindhearted person and I feel very honoured to have known him xx.” Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said: “All of us who knew him will be saddened by the news,”, while Nadhim Zahawi added: “May he rest in eternal peace.” • This article was amended on 23 January 2024 to correct the timing of Tony Lloyd’s roles as Greater Manchester’s police and crime commissioner and interim Greater Manchester mayor."

        "content": "Labour intends to restore Britain’s reputation as a place to do business after 14 years of Conservative economic failure, the shadow chancellor will tell members of the global elite in Davos on Wednesday. Stepping up Labour’s pre-election boardroom charm offensive, Reeves will tell a breakfast meeting hosted by the US investment bank JP Morgan that boosting private sector investment is key to the party’s growth strategy. “We are living in a new age of insecurity. The world has become a more uncertain, volatile and dangerous place. That has become ever more acute in recent days and weeks as we see wars and conflict in Europe and the Middle East,” Reeves is expected to say. “All major economies are being impacted by these global shocks, but Britain has been uniquely exposed. Fourteen years of stagnant economic growth and political uncertainty has left Britain weaker: the chaotic departure from the European Union, the turmoil under Liz Truss and now the managed decline with Rishi Sunak. This instability has turned businesses away, damaged our reputation and made us a less attractive place to do business.” Labour went into the last election with an expansion of public ownership at the heart of its economic strategy but Reeves and Keir Starmer have spent the past four years pursuing a more business-friendly approach. The shadow chancellor is being accompanied in Davos by Labour’s business spokesperson, Jonathan Reynolds. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is the most senior member of the cabinet scheduled to appear in Davos, but Reeves believes business support for the Conservatives has waned in recent years. She is expected to tell the JP Morgan breakfast that none of the ambitions of the next Labour government can be achieved without business. “The lifeblood of economic growth is private sector investment,” she is expected to say. “That is why we have put business investment at the heart of our plan for growth. “With Labour, Britain will be open to business. We will restore stability and security into our economy. We will restore Britain’s reputation as a place to do business. And we will be a trusted partner with business in delivering the change our country and our economy needs.” Reeves will say the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are having a direct impact on the UK in the form of rising energy bills, higher prices and growing business anxiety about the security of supply chains. “We must rebuild our nation’s economic defences so we can stand tall on the world stage once again. That is the only way we can bring about security for family finances and security for our national economy. That is the change a changed Labour party will hope to deliver if we are elected to power later this year.”"

Stevenson had spoken strongly in favour of the amendments: “All of us are united in wanting a bill that works,” she said.\nAs the bill goes in for its third reading, the question now is how the rebel Tory MPs will vote tomorrow – there is a chance that the bill may fail yet again because some in the party feel it is not strong enough.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.49pm GMT\n\n\n 8.20pm GMT \n\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, called the night’s events “total Tory chaos” that displayed how the prime minister is “so weak he’s lost control of [the] asylum system, border security and the whole Tory party.”\n\n\nTotal Tory chaos over their failing Rwanda schemeA scheme Rishi Sunak tried to cancelThat Home Secretary thinks is batshitAnd 58 Tory MPs say won’t workYet taxpayer paying £400m pricePM so weak he’s lost control of asylum system, border security & the whole Tory Party— Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.27pm GMT\n\n\n 8.04pm GMT \n\nThe Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael told LBC’s Henry Riley that the prime minister had been “embarrassed by his own MPs”.\n“Sunak’s Rwanda scheme just won’t work – even the deputy chairmen of his party know it,” Carmichael said, referring to tonight’s resignations of Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith after supporting amendments to the Rwanda bill.

As Labour puts it in its explanatory notes, the amendment would place “the monitoring committee for the Rwanda treaty on a statutory basis, and places conditions on when the classification of Rwanda as ‘safe’ can be suspended in accordance with material conditions and/or non-compliance with obligations under the Rwanda treaty”.\nThis will be the last vote of the night.\nMy colleague Vivian Ho is taking over now.\n\n\n\n 6.55pm GMT \n\nThe government has won the vote on clause 4 by 330 votes to 55 – a majority of 275.

This one would, in the words of the explanatory statement he provided alongside it, “remove the ability of individuals to block their own removal through suspensive claims and to limit such claims to rare situations where there is bad faith on the part of decision-makers in relation to decisions as to medical fitness to travel”.\nIn other words, it would make it significantly harder for individual asylum seekers to challenge deportation orders than it already is under the bill as drafted by the government.\n\n\n\n 6.28pm GMT \n\nThe government won the third vote, that clause 2 should “stand part” (see 6.18pm), by 331 votes to 262 – a majority of 69.\nThis one was basically a straight Tory v opposition contest.\n\n\n\n 6.26pm GMT \n60 Tory MPs rebelled on Cash amendment, division list shows - 58 voting for it, plus 2 tellers\n\nSixty Tory MPs rebelled against the government on the Bill Cash amendment, the division list shows.

Only one of them is likely to be on a rebel amendment (amendment 19 – Robert Jenrick’s amendment that would severely limit the ability of people to appeal against decisions to remove them).

(See 3.52pm.)\nHe says migrants would need “compelling evidence” to successfully appeal against deportation.\nLeigh warned about the risk of evidence being concocted. But that would not be compelling evidence, he says. And a tweet would not be compelling evidence, despite what Leigh suggested, he says.\n\n\n\n 5.15pm GMT \n\nIn the House of Lords this afternoon David Cameron, the foreign secretary, said the Rwanda policy was “novel”, but compatible with international law. He said:\n\nWe do not believe the Rwanda scheme is contrary to international law.\nHow I would characterise it is to say that, look, things like the refugee convention was written for another age, written for an age when there wasn’t mass international travel, when there wasn’t the ubiquity of mobile phones.\nAnd what we are saying is: yes. this is out-of-the-box thinking, yes it’s quite unorthodox, but you’ve got a choice, frankly, when you’ve got people arriving from a perfectly safe country to another safe country, you have to deal with that trade – and that requires some fresh thinking.\nNow, it’s not possible to put people straight back on a boat and take them back to France so that is why the Rwanda scheme is being introduced.\nIt is within the law, it is novel, but I believe it can work.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.19pm GMT\n\n\n 5.09pm GMT \nHome Office minister Michael Tomlinson starts speech winding up Rwanda debate\n\nMichael Tomlinson, the minister for illegal migration, is now winding up for the government.\nWe should now find out whether the government is willing to make any concessions at all to the rebels.\n\n\n\n 5.07pm GMT \n\nMiriam Cates, co-chair of the New Conservatives, told MPs that the UK was seen as a “soft touch”. There would only be a deterrent if migrants were swiftly deported, she said.\nAnd she said the rebel amendments were needed to ensure that happened.\nShe also said polling published by the Telegraph showed the public was in favour.\n\nUpdated at 5.12pm GMT\n\n\n 4.57pm GMT \n\nNigel Evans, the deputy speaker, said that he was only calling two more backbench speakers – Miriam Cates and Matt Warman.\nThat means the debate will not run for the full six hours. Voting is now expected to start around 5.45pm.\n\n\n\n 4.56pm GMT \nJane Stevenson, a government PPS, says she is backing rebel amendments\n\nJane Stevenson, parliamentary private secretary to Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, told MPs that the small boats issue was raised with her by constituents more than almost any other issue.\nAlison Thewliss from the SNP asks what option there is for people who are seeking asylum. There are no safe and legal routes available, she says.\nStevenson says people are fed up with opposition parties putting the interests of asylum seekers above the interests of Britain. She says Britain can never take all the people who want asylum.\nThewliss says no one is saying millions of refugees will come to the UK. Most refugees stay in their region, she says.\nStevenson disagrees.\nShe goes on to praise Rishi Sunak for what he said at a meeting in Italy in December where he talked about the need to amend international frameworks.\nAnd she ends by backing the rebel amendments.\nGiven that she is a PPS, she would normally be expected to resign, or to be sacked, if she were to do that. But in her speech she does not address this.\n\nUpdated at 5.07pm GMT\n\n\n 4.46pm GMT \nSimon Clarke claims, if mainstream parties do not stop the boats, extremists will fill gap\n\nClarke says the Jenrick amendments would not rule out all appeal rights.\nBut they would end abuses of the system, he says.\nAnd he says the bill must say, on the face of the legislation, that rule 39 injunctions from the European court of human rights will not have a binding effect in the UK. In his interview with Laura Kuenssberg, Rishi Sunak could not give that assurance. That is because he felt bound by the ministerial code, and advice from the attorney general, Clarke says.\nClarke says the bill’s best chance of success has been put at 50/50. That is not adequate, he says.\nReferring to the announcement about new judges (see 4.12pm), he says he does not know where those judges will come from. It would be better to ensure those legal challenges do not happen, he says.\nClarke says this comes down to a question of in whose interests do MPs serve. If mainstream, democratic politicians cannot solve the problems facing the country, our politics will “move to extremes”.\nHe says they are at the limits of what is tenable. Polling suggests Labour will win. But Labour will have to confront these problems, and if they don’t act, “they themselves will be eaten by this issue”.\nHe says if the mainstream parties do not address the problems, then extremists will fill the gap.\nHe says MPs have already voted for two immigration bills. He cannot let them down again. By the time of the next election, this bill will have had contact with the court system, and he thinks it will have failed.\nHe says “a few token flights” may have taken off. But that won’t be enough to provide a proper deterrent.\nWithout amendments, he will vote against the bill at third reading. That is because the Tories must show total determination to deal with this, he says.\nUPDATE: Clarke said:\n\nAnd I warned during the debates on Brexit – which I had hoped were relegated now to the annals of history – that this House was playing with fire if mainstream democratic politicians do not or cannot resolve the problems which face this country, our political process will I’m afraid move inextricably to the extremes.\nWe’ve heard a lot of rhetoric, and it is rhetoric, from the opposition benches about how extreme the position that we are advocating is. Trust me, it will be as nothing compared to who will sit on these benches if we fail in our task because we are at the limits of the tenable when it comes to the feelings of the British public.\nAnd if the Labour party win the general election that will be held later this year – which I freely admit the polling at the moment suggests that they will, in large part because of the frustration, frankly, that the British public feel about this issue – they will have to confront these same problems and if they are not willing to act any more than we have been willing to act then they themselves will be eaten by this issue just the same.\nIt is a certainty that this is a beast that we have to slay if it’s not to destroy all of the mainstream centre ground of British politics and leave it in the hands of people who will advocate genuinely radical and unacceptable solutions.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.16pm GMT\n\n\n 4.36pm GMT \n\nBack in the Commons Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary, is speaking now. He is one of the Tories who has said he will vote against the bill if the rebel amendments are not passed.\nHe says the government has made some progress in reducing small boat numbers. But it must tackle the causes of the problem, he says.\nThe government is spending £8m a day on accommodation for asylum seekers, he says.\nAnd there is a threat to security, because the government does not know who is coming in.\nThe test is not, is this the strongest legislation ever? Clarke says it is. But what matters is that it should work. \n\n\n\n 4.12pm GMT \nLady chief justice says it's for her, not government, to decide if more judges available for asylum appeals, in rebuke to No 10\n\nThe government has announced plans to increase the number of court rooms and judges available to process asylum appeals in a move at least partly designed to assure Tory MPs that it won’t allow delays in the appeals process to hold up deportation flights. (See 9.46am, 11.22am and 12.48pm.)\nBut Lady Carr, who as lady chief justice is the most senior judge in England and Wales, has hit back at suggestions that ministers are in charge of how judges are deployed. In an implicit rebuke to No 10, she said it was for her and the senior president of tribunals to decide if more judges would be allocated to appeals hearings, not ministers.\nIn evidence to the Commons justice committee, she said:\n\nParliament has legislated, we – the judiciary – have acted in preparation for that legislation.\nBut to be absolutely clear, matters of deployment of judges, the allocation of work for judges, and the use of courtrooms, is exclusively a matter for the judiciary, and more specifically, a matter for myself and the senior president of the tribunals. And it’s really important that people understand that clear division.\n\nIn his Commons written statement on this Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, does say: “The decision on whether to deploy additional judges temporarily to the upper tribunal, including when they sit and the courtrooms they use, is for the independent judiciary and will be taken by the relevant leadership judges at the time and in the interests of justice.” But this nuance may not have been obvious to people following the announcement, first made public in the Times under the headline: “Sunak to draft 150 judges to fast-track Rwanda appeals.”\nAs PA Media reports, Dame Sue Carr was appointed to the role in October and is now known as Lady Carr of Walton-on-the-Hill, sitting as a non-affiliated peer in the House of Lords. She is the first woman to serve as head of the judiciary of England and Wales since the inception of the lord chief justice in the 13th century.\n\nUpdated at 5.02pm GMT\n\n\n 3.52pm GMT \n\nBack in the Commons Sir Edward Leigh (Con) is speaking now. He is backing the amendments tabled by Robert Jenrick saying the bill should be made tougher, but he has also tabled two of his own, and he is specifically speaking to them.\nThe Leigh amendments would stop people arguing that it was unsafe to send them to Rwanda if they had intentionally done something to make Rwanda unsafe for them. As an example, he claims someone could make up a tweet for this purpose.\n\nIt’s so simple. You can manufacture some spurious opposition to the Rwandan regime. You could do a tweet – even I could do a tweet – you can do a tweet in five minutes saying that the president of a Rwanda is a dictator, or that he should be overthrown, and you’ve done it.\n\nAlison Thewliss for the SNP intervenes. Clearly unimpressed by Leigh’s reasoning, she asks him when he last spoke to an asylum seeker. He does not reply to the question.\nUPDATE: Leigh said:\n\nYou can concoct so easily a history of mental illness, it’s so subjective, it’s easy enough to find a doctor to sign a medical certificate saying that you have a history of mental illness, it’s easy to concoct a personal history. For instance if you come from Iran, that you allege that you are gay for instance, again no tribunal will export you to Iran if you say that you are gay. If you come from Iraq you can say that you are an activist Christian, whether you are or not.\nI cannot see how anybody who has a right to go through the judicial process – given the ease that you create a history, personal history, which will make your own personal circumstances impossible in Rwanda – I can’t believe that any court or any tribunal will export somebody to Rwanda.”\nThey may not concoct it, it may be entirely true, we don’t know. But what we do know is that every single person who arrives in Dover will say, and we all know this is true, every single asylum seeker will say that they cannot be sent off to Rwanda because of their own personal history – and every single one of us would do the same thing.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.18pm GMT\n\n\n 3.41pm GMT \nUK withdrawal from ECHR would have 'dramatic consequences' for people in Northern Ireland, says senior MEP\n\n“Dramatic consequences” for EU and UK citizens in Northern Ireland would result from any hindering or British withdrawal from the European convention on human rights (UNHCR), a senior MEP with oversight of post Brexit relations has warned.“Such action would cast a shadow on the UK’s trustworthiness and ability to abide by international treaties and conventions it has ratified,” added Nathalie Loiseau, France’s ex-Europe minister and the European parliament’s chair of of a joint EU-UK forum set up under the post-Brexit deal struck between London and Brussels.She sounded the warning in a letter to the Labour MP and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, Stella Creasy, who had sought the views of EU representatives on concerns that Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda deportation bill was incompatible with the convention.The convention was at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, Loiseau replied, and full compliance with it was “a cornerstone” of the relationship the EU was building with the UK. She was worried by any statements aimed at hindering the application of the UNHCR, or calls for a withdrawal, adding that the EU would be “entitled to adopt any relevant measure to mitigate the risks”.Creasy said the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) between the UK and EU was up for review by 2026, and showing that Britain could “play by the rules and stick to it” would be crucual to getting a better deal. She added:\n\nThe timing of these proposals is terrible for making us seem like a nation others want to do business with.\n\n\n\nNEW:“​Dramatic consequences” for EU & UK citizens in Northern Ireland ​w​ould result from any hindering or British withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights (UNHCR)- a senior MEP with oversight of post Brexit relations has warned in a letter to @stellacreasy pic.twitter.com/C0mGeh4RrD— Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.33pm GMT \n\nSam Coates from Sky has been keeping a tally and he says there are currently just five Conservative MPs saying they will vote against the government at third reading on the Rwanda bill if they don’t get the amendments they want.\n\n5 Tories currently saying they’ll vote against at 3rd reading \nMiriam Cates \nMarco Longhi \nRobert Jenrick \nSuella Braverman \nSimon Clarke \n* Gvt formal majority 54 \n* So 28 (/2 +1) needed to defeat gvt \n* Abstentions count as half \n* But some independent Tories (Matt Hancock) expected to vote with gvt, while others staying away abstain, so real hurdle slightly higher than 28\n\n\n\n5 Tories currently saying they'll vote against at 3rd readingMiriam CatesMarco LonghiRobert JenrickSuella BravermanSimon Clarke* Gvt formal majority 54 * So 28 (/2 +1) needed to defeat gvt* Abstentions count as half* But some independent Tories (Matt Hancock) expected… https://t.co/Kjuc0imoRn— Sam Coates Sky (@SamCoatesSky) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.14pm GMT \n\nSir Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, is now speaking in the Commons. He is a Tory centrist and he has tabled six amendments of his own which are intended to make the bill more compliant with international law, not less.\n(If the other Tory amendments are described as “toughening” the bill, arguably Buckland’s could be seen as “weakening” it – although doubtless he would not see it like that.)\nOne Nation Conservatives like Buckland want to discourage Rishi Sunak from accepting the demands of Robert Jenrick and his “five family” allies. But Buckland has not got any of his colleagues from that wing of the party putting their names to his amendments. “The One Nation agreed collective position was that we weren’t going to table any amendments.

He has signed all the main Tory rebel amendments, but he has also tabled his own – amendment 10 – and it’s a “notwithstanding clause” that would allow the government to go ahead with deportations to Rwanda regardless of what the European convention on human rights, and other international law, says.\nHe says he sent Rishi Sunak a briefing giving multiple examples of cases where countries had ignored international law without sanctions being applied.\nThis has happened in almost every jurisdiction, he says, including the EU, the US, France and Germany.\nHe says the UK has a dualist approach to international law. International law does not have a fixed status in domestic law, he says. He says the sovereignty of parliament prevails.\nIn Germany it is different, he says, because international law is an integral part of domestic law there.\n\nUpdated at 2.55pm GMT\n\n\n 2.31pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons Robert Jenrick has just intervened again on Stephen Kinnock, and asked him to clarify whether Labour thinks Rwanda is or is not a safe country.\nKinnock says Labour accepts the judgment of the supreme court, which said Rwanda was not safe.\n\nUpdated at 2.56pm GMT\n\n\n 2.28pm GMT \n\nPippa Crerar says that, even though Boris Johnson is backing the Tory rebels on the Rwanda bill, that does not mean they have got the clout to get Rishi Sunak to change his mind.\n\n\nThis could end up being another Windsor framework vote - when Boris Johnson led the charge against Rishi Sunak’s Northern Ireland border plans in March 2023 and just 22 Tory MPs rebelled.

Both wings of party, and govt sources, currently saying they don’t think right has numbers.\n\nThere are more than 22 Tory MPs who have signed at least one of the rebel amendments. Miriam Cates puts the total number at 66. (See 9.46am.) But Labour is opposed to the Tory amendments – as Stephen Kinnock told the Commons just a moment ago – and so there is no risk to No 10 of those amendments being passed.\n\n\n\n 2.24pm GMT \n\nRobert Jenrick intervenes, and asks Kinnock if he can confirm a Times story published over Christmas saying Labour would consider offshore asylum processing. He says sending people abroad for asylum processing only to bring them back if asylum were granted would be even more expensive.\nKinnock says people applying for asylum under the Ukraine scheme have their claims processed offshore.\n\n\n\n 2.21pm GMT \nLabour condemns Rwanda policy as unaffordable, unworkable and unlawful\n\nStephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, is now making Labour’s case.\nHe starts by saying Labour is opposed to the bill in its entirety. He says the party wants to stop the boats and “fix our broken asylum system”. But he says Labour will “never support any proposal that is unaffordable, unworkable or unlawful”.\n\nWe on these benches will be proudly voting against the amendments that are being promoted by the benches opposite because the government’s Rwanda policy is unaffordable, unworkable and unlawful, because this bill is an affront to the values that we hold dear and because we will always stand up for the separation of powers, for the rule of law and for ensuring we can stand tall in the world.\n\nHe says the government has already committed £400m to this policy. But the Rwandan authorities have only got the capacity to take 1% of the 30,000 people who have arrived since the Illegal Migration Act was passed, he says. And that means it won’t work as a deterrent.\nHe also says the policy was ruled illegal by the supreme court. Referring to the way the new bill says Rwanda is a safe country, contrary to what the supreme court says, he goes on:\n\nWe find ourselves confronted by a government that is seeking to legislate for an alternative reality, because while ministers appear to believe that they can pass a bill which determines that the sky is green, and the grass is blue, that does not make it so.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.31pm GMT\n\n\n 2.11pm GMT \nJenrick says Sunak should accept rebel Tory amendments because they all comply with international law\n\nJenrick says the government has said it will only accept amendments that have respectable legal arguments in their favour.\nBut he says the amendments he has tabled pass this test. He says he has an opinion from John Larkin KC, a former attorney general for Northern Ireland, saying all the amendments that have been tabled by him, and by Bill Cash, comply with international law.\nHe goes on:\n\nUnless the goalposts have been shifted by the government, I see no reason why the prime minister and the minister couldn’t accept these amendments and enable us to strengthen this bill once and for all.\n\n\n\n\n 2.04pm GMT \n\nJenrick says the government cites Albania, and the large number of Albanian people who have been returned, as evidence the bill will work.\nBut he says almost all of the Albanians who have returned have been foreign offenders. The issue is different, he says.\n\nUpdated at 2.07pm GMT\n\n\n 2.02pm GMT \nRobert Jenrick tells MPs he does not accept government's claim Rwanda would not accept tougher bill\n\nRobert Jenrick, the Conservative former immigration minister, is speaking now. He has tabled the key rebel amendments backed by Tories who want the bill to be tougher.\nHe says the bill as drafted will not work.\nMinisters in other countries want the policy to work, because they want something in place to deter illegal migration, he says.\nChris Bryant (Lab) intervenes to say he agrees with Jenrick that the bill won’t work. But he says the danger of crossing the Channel ought to be the strongest deterrent possible, but that does not stop people coming. So why will the bill act as a deterrent?\nJenrick says ignores the point, and just argues that now there is no deterrent in place.\nJenrick is now talking about his amendment that would stop individuals appealing against removal. (It is amendment 21 – one of 16 amendments that Jenrick has either tabled or signed.)\nHe says the bill as drafted does tighten up the opportunity for legal challenges.\nBut it still allows legal challenges, and if someone makes a successful challenge, NGOs will school other asylum seekers into what they need to say to win an appeal.\nHe says the UK only has 2,000 spaces where it can hold people in immigration removal centres.\nBut 1,200 people arrived one day in August, he says.\nThat means the country does not have the capacity to hold all the people who arrive. They would have to be bailed to hotels, and then they would abscond. The scheme would be seen to have failed, he says.\nTim Loughton (Con) says this amendment might make the bill unworkable, at least in the eyes of the Rwandan government. (Rwanda said it would not support the policy if it broke international law.) What would happen then?\nJenrick says he does not accept this argument. He says Rwanda is not party to the European convention on human rights. And, if the policy were to be ruled illegal, that would be because of what was happening in Rwanda.\nAnd he says, if the UK government was really concerned about this, it would not be proposing a policy deemed unlawful by UNHCR.\nHe says he is not blaming Rwanda. He says it was a mistake for the government to get Rwanda to issue the statement saying it would not back a tougher bill.\n\nUpdated at 3.14pm GMT\n\n\n 1.47pm GMT \n\nIn her speech Alison Thewliss (SNP) says she is particularly opposed to the amendments tabled by Robert Jenrick and fellow Tory MPs. They imply asylum seekers “do not matter”, she says.\nAnd she is also critical of Labour.

That is because the SNP amendment saying the bill should declare Rwanda unsafe, instead of safe, is the first amendment selected for debate.\nThewliss starts by saying that the SNP has tabled amendments not because they would support an amended bill, but because this is the only mechanism for getting their points debated. She says the bill is “irredeemably awful”. The bill will not work.\nSir Michael Fabricant (Con) intervenes, and asks how many “illegal asylum seekers” Scotland is hosting, compared with England. Thewliss says Fabricant should realise that there is no such thing as an illegal asylum seeker.\n(Under international refugee law, people can apply for asylum in any country that has signed the refugee convention and so there is nothing illegal about their applying for asylum. The government does not talk about illegal asylum seekers. But it does talk about illegal migration, because it has legislated to say that arriving in the UK without authorisation is an offence.)\n\nUpdated at 1.57pm GMT\n\n\n 1.27pm GMT \n\nProf Colin Rawlings and Prof Michael Thrasher, the psephologists mainly responsible for the research suggesting that Labour needs a swing of 12.7% to win a majority at the election (see 11.04am), have published a detailed explainer of their analysis. They say that calculation does not take into account changes in vote share affecting the smaller parties and that, in practice, a smaller swing might suffice. They explain:\n\nA concentration on the direct swing between Labour and the Conservatives makes the implicit assumption that there will be no change in the share of votes cast for the Liberal Democrats and the nationalist parties. In practice this is unlikely to be true, especially in the case of the Scottish National party (SNP). For example, a 10% swing from the SNP to Labour in Scotland would yield that party 15 gains under the new boundaries and ease its path towards Downing Street.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.32pm GMT\n\n\n 1.21pm GMT \n\nThe start of the Rwanda bill debate is being held up for about 15 minutes because MPs are voting on an Alba 10-minute rule bill motion saying the Scottish parliament should have the power to legislate for an independence referendum.\n\n\n\n 1.11pm GMT \n\nSir John Hayes, chair of the Common Sense group of Tory MPs, has told Times Radio that it would be “very difficult” for him to vote for the Rwanda bill at third reading if the rebel amendments have not been backed. He said:\n\nIf the bill is unamended and not fit for purpose … it would be very difficult to vote for that wouldn’t it? I can’t see how you could.\nI can’t see how having supported the amendments … I don’t think having done all that, you can then say the bill, which we regard as imperfect, should be supported. So that would be a difficult decision.\n\nHayes has put his name to 16 amendments to the bill.\nOf course, refusing to vote for the bill at third reading is not the same as vowing to vote against it.\n\n\n\n 1.07pm GMT \nMPs debate on Rwanda bill\n\nMPs will very soon start debating the Rwanda bill. The debate will run for up to six hours.\nToday they are debating amendments related to clause 2, which is about the safety of Rwanda, and clause 4, which allows individuals to appeal against decisions to deport them.\nThe text of the bill is here, and the paper listing all amendments that have been tabled is here.\nOne of the amendments being debated is an SNP one changing the bill so that, instead of saying Rwanda is a safe country, the bill says it is an unsafe country. The grouping of amendments implies there will definitely be a vote on this.\n\n\n\n 12.52pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has announced that on Thursday MPs will vote on the regulations making Hizb ut-Tahrir a proscribed organisation.\nLucy Powell, the shadow leader of the Commons, asked Mordaunt to confrim that the third reading of the Rwanda bill would definitely take place tomorrow. She said there have been some reports saying it could be postponed.\nIn response, Mordaunt just said the third reading vote would be dependent on the progress the bill made through the Commons.\n\n\n\n 12.48pm GMT \nAlex Chalk says allocating more courts and judges for asylum appeal will allow 'vast majority' of cases to be processed quickly\n\nAlex Chalk, the justice secretary, has issued a Commons written statement about the government plan to allocate more judges to deal with appeals by asylum seekers who are facing removal from the UK. (See 9.46am and 11.22am.) The Illegal Migration Act, which has been passed into law but not fully implemented (because it depends on the government being able to deport people to Rwanda) creates an accelerated system for appeals. In an announcement about how this will work, Chalk says:\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has been working to increase capacity in the justice system in preparation for the commencement of the Act. Additional hearing rooms have been prepared, making a total of 25 hearing rooms available within the existing Immigration and Asylum Chamber (IAC) estate in London. These rooms are set up with remote hearing technology, allowing for either in-person or remote hearings to maximise flexibility. Over 100 additional staff have been recruited to support the Upper Tribunal’s work and are currently undertaking training ready for the commencement of the Illegal Migration Act.\nThe Illegal Migration Act provides for First-tier Tribunal judges to be deployed to sit in the Upper Tribunal to hear Illegal Migration Act appeals. The judiciary have identified relevant judges, which could provide over 5,000 additional sitting days. The decision on whether to deploy additional judges temporarily to the Upper Tribunal, including when they sit and the courtrooms they use, is for the independent judiciary and will be taken by the relevant leadership judges at the time and in the interests of justice …\nWe are confident that, with the additional court room and judicial capacity detailed above, in line with projected levels agreed with the Home Office the vast majority of Illegal Migration Act appeal work will be dealt with by the courts in an expedited manner.\n\n\n\n\n 12.38pm GMT \nNo 10 rejects claim from UNHCR that its Rwanda policy remains incompatible with international refugee law\n\nThe UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), which has repeatedly criticised the government’s Rwanda policy, has released a fresh analysis saying that, even with the new treaty signed with Rwanda, the government’s bill is incompatible with international law. In the report it says:\n\nUNHCR has reviewed the updated UK-Rwanda scheme in light of the principles and standards set out in its 2022 analysis and summarised in Part I above. It maintains its position that the arrangement, as now articulated in the UK-Rwanda Partnership Treaty and accompanying legislative scheme does not meet the required standards relating to the legality and appropriateness of the transfer of asylum seekers and is not compatible with international refugee law.\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said the government did not accept this assessment. The PM’s spokesperson said:\n\nI haven’t seen specifically what [UNHCR] have said, but we have set out the summary of our legal advice and obviously we are legislating to enable us to do this. The UNHCR also have a partnership with Rwanda ensuring they can safely take in migrants, I think from Libya, including a number quite recently.\n\n\n\n\n 12.20pm GMT \n\nAccording to Alex Wickham from Bloomberg, government whips think only around five to 10 Tory MPs would vote against the Rwanda bill at third reading.\n\nThe big question next 48 hours: are govt whips right that there are only 5-10 right-wing rebels willing to vote against the bill and challenge Sunak?\n\n\n\nThe big question next 48 hours: are govt whips right that there are only 5-10 right-wing rebels willing to vote against the bill and challenge Sunak? https://t.co/ClroiVaPp0— Alex Wickham (@alexwickham) January 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.17pm GMT \n\nMore than 60 Tory MPs have signed at least one of the various rebel amendments to the Rwanda bill tabled by hardliners. But very few of them have said publicly that, if the amendments are not passed, they will definitely vote against the bill at third reading. Suella Braverman and Miriam Cates are among the diehards in this category. But Simon Clarke, in his ConservativeHome, only says, that, if the bill is not changed, he will not vote for the bill at third reading, implying he would abstain.\nIn an interview with Sky News, Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister who has tabled the rebel amendments attracting most support, said he was “prepared” to vote against the bill at third reading. He said:\n\nI am prepared to vote against the bill … because this bill doesn’t work, and I do believe that a better bill is possible.\nSo the government has a choice. It can either accept my amendments … or it can bring back a new and improved bill, and it could do that within a matter of days because we know the shape of that bill.\n\nThat form of words suggests he is still hoping for some sort of compromise offer that will enable him to justify not voting against the bill at third reading.\n\nUpdated at 12.54pm GMT\n\n\n 12.07pm GMT \n\nThe debate on the Rwanda bill is due to start soon after 12.30pm. Government sources have indicated that talks are still going with backbenchers over amendments, and have not ruled out accepting some of them.\nThe full list of amendments is here. While some of them would be totally unacceptable to No 10, others are less problematic. For example, Robert Jenrick’s amendment 23, intended to ensure that European court of human rights’ injunctions do not stop deportations, is very close to what Rishi Sunak said on this topic yesterday.\n\nUpdated at 12.54pm GMT\n\n\n 11.54am GMT \nTory papers mostly back Sunak, not hardline rebel MPs, ahead of key votes on Rwanda bill\n\nThe main opposition to Rishi Sunak in Tory circles comes from the so-called “five families” – a nickname used by at least some of the leader of the five groups wanting to toughen the bill: the New Conservatives, the European Research Group, the Common Sense group, the Conservative Growth Group and the Northern Research Group.\nBut there are another “five families” whose views are important in Tory politics. They are the five main Conservative-leaning papers: the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, the Sun, the Daily Telegraph and the Times. (The Times is not quite as pro-Tory as the others – historically, it is more pro-establishment than pro-Conservative – but it is not aligned with Labour.) Broadly, these papers have all been calling for tougher action to tackle the problem of small boats. But, on the Rwanda bill, four out of five of them in their editorials are backing Sunak rather than the Tory rebels now being supported by Boris Johnson. That is to a large extent because they are worried that a bitter split will be bad for the party’s prospects at the general election.\nIn its editorial today the Daily Mail says Tory rebels “must park their differences and get behind their leader in these critical months before the election”.\nThe Daily Express says in its editorial: “We strongly wish Mr Sunak to succeed … We concur with Tory chairman Richard Holden, who said it’s time to get the legislation ‘across the line’.”\nIn an editorial yesterday the Sun said Conservative MPs “must come together this week and back the prime minister’s plan – however imperfect they consider it to be – to help stop future tragedies”.\nAnd in an editorial yesterday the Times said the bill was “a sensible balance, respecting the will of parliament and the rights of the individual” and that MPs should support it.\nThe only paper backing the rebels, or at least partly backing them, is the Daily Telegraph. In its editorial today it says Sunak should accept some of their demands. It says:\n\n[Sunak] could plough on and assume the rebels cannot muster the votes needed to defeat him or try to meet them halfway. There is scope to accept that individual appeals against deportation orders should be allowed only in the most extreme circumstances. That might stop the legal process being abused to clog up the system so that no flights to Rwanda ever leave the ground.\nAn amendment that would automatically block the European Court of Human Rights from granting last-minute injunctions to suspend flights, known as Rule 39 orders, should also be accepted.\nThere is a wider point here. Successive Tory governments have promised both to stop the boats and curb legal migration and have yet to do either.\nThe voters are telling pollsters that this failure is one reason why they are not planning to support the Tories, even if they are not especially enthused by Labour. Mr Sunak needs to find a way to show them he understands their concerns.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.56pm GMT\n\n\n 11.22am GMT \n\nHere is more from the story in the Times by Steven Swinford and Matt Dathan on Rishi Sunak’s plan to bring in more judges to stop asylum appeals clogging up the system and delaying flights to Rwanda. (See 9.46am.) They report:\n\nMinisters are preparing to announce plans to move 150 judges from the first-tier tribunal to the upper tribunal, the body that will hear appeals under the new legislation.\nThe judges are being given additional training and will be paid more to sit on evenings and weekends. The government has also brought in 100 extra officials to process claims and will create additional hearing rooms.\nThis is designed to fast-track the process of considering individual legal appeals lodged by migrants. The Home Office believes 99.5% of individual legal challenges will fail but there is still a risk that large numbers lodging appeals will clog up the system sufficiently to delay and frustrate their removal. A government source said the extra manpower will ensure that in the “very unlikely scenario a claim proceeds, it will be dealt with swiftly and not clog up the system”.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.43am GMT\n\n\n 11.15am GMT \n\nThe new analysis about the swing Labour needs to win a general election (see 11.04am) is based on the new constituency boundaries.

Peter Barnes, the BBC’s elections and political analyst, says:\n\nThe next election will be fought on new constituency boundaries, redrawn to reflect population changes and to try to even out voter numbers in each area.\nAn analysis of these changes for BBC News, ITV News, Sky News and the Press Association suggests Labour needs a national swing of 12.7% to win with just a small majority.\nThat’s considerably higher than the 10.2% achieved by Tony Blair in 1997 and higher even than the 12% achieved by Clement Attlee in 1945.\nThe swing from the Conservatives to Labour would need to be uniform, to follow the same pattern everywhere, with other parties seeing no change in performance since 2019.\n\nThe report has been welcomed by Labour figures worried about yesterday’s YouGov MRP poll suggesting the Labour is on course for a majority of 120 seats. This is from Alastair Campbell, the former No 10 spin doctor who is now a star podcaster.\n\nAfter all the ballyhoo created by the right wing ecosystem yesterday re Telegraph/Frost poll, might I suggest this analysis nearer the mark. Ps also on polls, Tories now talking of “private polls”.

But it is worth pointing out that, when Tony Blair achieved his 10.2% swing in 1997, that was a swing from the results in 1992, when Labour came quite close to winning. Keir Starmer’s swing will be benchmarked against the 2019 result, when Labour recorded its worst result since 1935.\nIt is also the case that voters are more willing to switch parties when they vote at elections than in the past. This chart, from a recent report from UK in a Changing Europe, illustrates this.\nUPDATE: A couple of readers have been in touch to point out that, although Labour’s election result in 2019 was the worst since 1935 in terms of number of seats won, it wasn’t the worst since then in terms of vote share, which is more relevant for a discussion of swing. One wrote to me to say:\n\nThe 2019 Labour result was not the worst since 1935 in terms of vote share (which is what you are discussing). The Labour share was lower than 2019 in 1983, 1987, 2010, and 2015.\n\nAnd other said:\n\nSurely vote swing is measured against vote share, not seats won? And of the 10 elections prior to 2019, Labour’s vote share was higher in 6 (one of those under Corbyn) and lower in 4. On that basis, far from the ‘worst since 1935’; actually only the worst since 2015.\n\nAll this is true. But the broad point – which is that bouncing back from a bad defeat is easier than bouncing back from a narrow defeat – still stands.\n\nUpdated at 3.28pm GMT\n\n\n 10.36am GMT \nGove says he is 'pretty sure' Lee Anderson will still be Tory deputy chair at next election\n\nMichael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has told Times Radio that he is “pretty sure” that Lee Anderson will still be a Conservative party deputy chair at the time of the next election.\nHe made the comment when asked if he thought Anderson would be sacked for saying he will vote against the government on the Rwanda bill.

I think the bill does make sure – it’s one of the toughest pieces of migration legislation to come before the House of Commons if not the toughest – and it makes sure that ministers can quickly and clearly send people to Rwanda because it deals with all of the concerns that the supreme court had.\n\nConservative party deputy chairs and vice-chairs (vice-chairs are more junior) are not members of the government, but they are considered part of the “payroll vote” and expected to vote with the government. In the past people have been sacked from these posts for rebelling, as Stephen Hammond was after a Brexit vote in 2017.\n\nUpdated at 11.44am GMT\n\n\n 10.13am GMT \nBoris Johnson backs Tory rebels trying to strengthen Rwanda bill, saying it should be 'as robust as possible'\n\nBoris Johnson, the former PM, has backed the rebel Tory MPs pushing amendments designed to make the Rwanda bill tougher.

At the time Sunak had doubts as to whether it would work, according to a recent leak to the BBC.\nJohnson was commenting on a tweet posted by Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary, linking to an article Clarke has written for ConservativeHome on this topic. In the article Clarke says:\n\nAt the moment, the government’s own assessment is that the bill as drafted has only a 50/50 chance of success. For me, that’s simply not good enough.\nThere are no guarantees in politics, as in life, but I owe it to the people who send me to Westminster, who have put their trust in me to act as I know they wish to be represented, to be able to look them in the eye and say that I sincerely believe our new law will work.\nIf our amendments are rejected, and I can’t do that, then I can’t vote for it.\nI don’t know yet how this week will unfold. All outcomes are possible and I hope sincerely that the government will accept improvements to the legislation.\nBut if things go wrong, there are a number of us who have shown before, just as we did on Theresa May’s soft Brexit legislation, that we won’t hesitate to act on principle to actually get things done.\nWe were right then and we were right now. The public is absolutely exhausted of politicians who are only prepared to offer half measures, and to see our country limp along in a stupor of inaction and failure.\nEnough. We either amend this bill so that it will work, or we face utter disaster when it becomes clear over the months ahead that it does not deliver. Many of us will not stand idly by and let that happen.\n\n\n\n\n 10.01am GMT \n\nJulia Kollewe is covering the Post Office Horizon scandal hearings today on a separate live blog.

MPs will this afternoon start two days of debate on Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda bill, and the proceedings, and votes, are going to be an interesting trial of strength between Sunak and the rightwing faction in his party that does not rate him and wants him out. At one point there was talk in hardline Tory circles about the rebellion triggering a leadership contest, with Kemi Badenoch lined up to be installed as the Tories’ sixth PM since 2010. No one is expecting that now. But over the next two days we will find out quite how many Conservatives are willing to vote against the government on Rwanda, and quite how vitriolic they are willing to be about Sunak’s strategy. We’ll also find out whether Sunak feels he is strong enough to sack the two Tory deputy chairs who say they will vote against the government, or whether their revolt will be tolerated.\nThe debates will also set the stage for a significant “I told you so” moment in Tory politics later this year. The rebels say, without significant amendment, the bill will fail to “stop the boats”. Sunak claims it can and will work. Mainstream legal opinion is probably with the rebels at this point. No one knows for sure, but by the time of the election it will be easier to say whether or not the bill has worked.\nThis morning the Times is reporting that, in a further effort to get his MPs to support the bill, Sunak is planning to “fast-track migrant appeals against deportation to Rwanda by drafting in 150 judges and freeing up courtrooms”.\nThe proposal has not impressed Miriam Cates, co-chair of the New Conservatives, a rightwing Tory group calling for drastic cuts to immigration and withdrawal from the European convention on human rights. She told the Today programme:\n\nAll that this drafting in of more judges shows is that the government is expecting a large number of legal claims. And don’t forget that they can then go to appeal. And then the idea of the deterrent doesn’t work because people know that they can stay in this country for a large period of time – their claims may be heard, they may be kept in this country for a long period of time.\nThe point of a deterrent is that everybody who arrives here is swiftly detained and deported. We’re not saying that people should not be able to make legal claims. What we’re saying is that those claims need to be made in Rwanda, people will still have, under our amendments, those full rights of appeal in Rwanda. But the point is they need to be deported to Rwanda in order to have this deterrent.\n\nCates also said she would vote against the bill at third reading (on Wednesday evening) if the proposed rightwing amendments were not passed or accepted. She said she did not know how many colleagues would do the same, but that 66 Conservatives had signed at least one of the rebel amendments.\nI will be focusing mostly on this story all day. There are also important Post Office Horizon scandal hearings taking place, but we will cover those on a separate live blog.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\nMorning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet.\n10am: Rajbinder Sangha, a former member of Fujitsu’s fraud team, gives evidence to the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry.\n10am: Lord Arbuthnot, the Tory peer and former MP, and Neil Hudgell, a lawyer, who both backed victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal, give evidence to the Commons business committee about the scandal. The committee is taking evidence from many key figures this morning including Alan Bates and Jo Hamilton (victims and campaigners) at 10.30am; Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office, and Paul Patterson, director of Fujitsu Services, at 11am, and Kevin Hollinrake and Carl Creswell, business resilience director at the Department for Business and Trade, at 11.30am.\n10am: The UK Covid inquiry starts hearings in Edinburgh, with opening statements from counsel.\n10am: Eluned Morgan, the Welsh government’s health minister, and Judith Paget, chief executive of NHS Wales, hold a press conference on the impact of the junior doctors’ strike in Wales.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\nAfter 12.30pm: MPs start a six-hour debate on amendments to the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill.\nAfter 3pm: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Lords on Israel and Gaza, UN sustainable development goals, the rules-based order and the Rohingya refugee crisis.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "Rishi Sunak was the most junior of ministers when Theresa May faced her worst Brexit ructions, but as he battles Commons votes, endless amendments and mutinous Conservative factions, the prime minister might have some retrospective sympathy for his predecessor-but-two. The parallels do not end there. With Brexit largely viewed as completed, Sunak’s Rwanda deportation bill has become emblematic of what many Tory MPs see as the party’s main ideological battleground: migration, and most specifically, small boats. To extend the comparison one more time, much as May led a party that almost unanimously embraced departure from the EU, however reluctantly in some cases, virtually all current Tories accept the basic premise of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, at least in public. The Conservatives are thus, once again, mired in what a Freudian-minded backbencher might term the political narcissism of small differences and at risk of implosion over amendments to the text of a bill or treaty that about 95% of the voting population would struggle to distinguish between. However, while May faced a never-ending series of top-level ministerial resignations, Sunak’s internal discipline quandary has, thus far, been a bit more lower league: a pair of Conservative party deputy chairs, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith. The fact that both very publicly announced they were signing up to amendments intended to toughen up the bill left Sunak with the complex issue of either ignoring the disloyalty, which would leave him looking very weak, or sacking them. The second option risked him facing the unredacted ire of both, notably Anderson, who has an inflammatory turn of phrase and a route to the Tory faithful via his £100,000-a-year presenting gig with GB News. In the end both resigned – whether this followed pressure from No 10 remains to be seen – via a conciliatory joint letter that pledged their complete support to Sunak except, obviously, on the bill. Similarly, the government did not give way over any of the amendments, indicating Sunak plans to tough things out, at least for now. This is the tactic May used, and we all know how that ended. But Sunak does have one slightly paradoxical trump card nestled up a snugly tailored sleeve: the sheer vulnerability of his political position. In 2019, the Conservative Brexit ultras not only disliked and mistrusted May, but believed that if they got rid of her then the party might do electorally better under Boris Johnson, as turned out to be the case. This time, if the rebels go too far, the most likely outcome is a swift election and thus political oblivion for them and for many dozens of their colleagues and friends. A crunch point will come when MPs vote on the third reading of the Rwanda bill, which is likely to be on Wednesday evening. If Sunak faces a potentially significant rebellion, some allies are arguing he should characterise it as a confidence vote, meaning a loss would bring down the government. This seems unlikely, in part as Sunak will know that the self-styled “five families” of the Tory right traditionally overpromise and underdeliver when it comes to Commons mutinies. And thus, the most likely outcomes remain either a fudge over amendments or a damp squib of a rebellion. But as observers of the post-2016 Conservative party know only too well, rationality is by no means guaranteed and events can escalate swiftly, with mounting backbench anger toppling May and Johnson within weeks, and Liz Truss in days. This time, however, even the most vehement rebel will realise that if the threshold of 53 MPs’ letters of no confidence is accidentally reached, then rather than another fresh start the Tories would face a most likely irresistible public clamour for an election. They also all know how this would end. Monday’s Daily Telegraph constituency-extrapolated mega-poll gave Labour a projected 120-seat majority, one viewed by many pundits as an underestimate, even without the context of a snap election forced by Tory splits. Sunak does not have to spell this out. He, and all his MPs, know where they are: on the very edge of a precipice. Can the prime minister guide his troops back from the edge, and not forward into the abyss? We will find out soon enough."

        "content": "A French woman who lost her job in the UK after a mix-up over the Brexit immigration process has had her residency and work rights restored by the Home Office after publicising her story. Paula Serre had been waiting for two years for a final decision on her application when her life was turned upside down. In December, the company she worked for discovered the Home Office “share code” to confirm an EU citizen’s right to work in the UK no longer worked, leaving her employer the choice of dismissing her or face a £20,000 fine. But after Serre shared her story with the Guardian, the Home Office immediately got in touch to tell her she had mistakenly applied for a family permit under the EU settlement scheme, which is designed for relatives in the EU wishing to join their families, instead of applying for status in her own right. Serre, who was named “Sophie” in earlier media reports, had wrongly assumed the family permit route was the correct one because she was married to a British man. EU citizens who lived in the UK permanently before Brexit have lifelong employment and social rights protected by the Brexit withdrawal agreement, signed by the UK and the EU. When Serre’s original application was rejected by the Home Office, she was not notified that she had filled in the wrong form, so she unwittingly went down an irrelevant route – appealing against the decision through an immigration tribunal. She said that after the Guardian reported her case not only did she get a call from the Home Office, but her – by that point late – application for EU settled status was accepted immediately. “I cannot put into words how grateful I am. I have literally been given my life back. Not just mine, but my husband’s, my son’s – we can now look forward to a normal, settled life, make plans and just look forward to the future,” she said. Her husband, Liam, who works in the same logistics company in Warwickshire, is “ecstatic”, while her employer said she “couldn’t believe it”. Serre, who estimates she has spent about £2,000 on legal fees, added: “It is incredible that after the struggle of the past two years for status to be granted in just 24 hours.” She hopes the Home Office will adapt its procedures to help people through a process that the former home secretary Amber Rudd said should be as easy as buying shoes. She added: “I am very thankful that someone at the Home Office was keen to do a good job because, left on my own, I might still be waiting. I think I’ve been really, really lucky, but I do hope that they change their process because there’s no point at the end of the day in not telling people. “What did all this paperwork and all this back and forth achieve? Nothing.”"

        "content": "An estimated 3 million Britons living abroad for more than 15 years will regain their right to vote in parliamentary elections in the UK from Tuesday, ending 20 years of broken promises by successive UK governments. The end of the so-called 15-year rule means millions more could be enfranchised in time for the next general election, the date of which has yet to be decided by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. The campaign group British in Europe said the change in the law brought the UK in line with other major democracies which allow lifelong voting rights, including the US, France, Italy and Canada. “Voting is a basic citizenship right regardless of where someone lives. This is a historic change to the UK franchise after years of campaigning by ourselves and others, particularly long-term campaigner Harry Shindler, who sadly died before he could use his hard-won vote,” said co-chair Jane Golding. The campaign group is partnering with the Electoral Commission to answer frequently asked questions around the issue and raise awareness overseas. Voters interested in having their say in parliamentary elections can register at the last constituency in which they were registered or where they have lived if they were not registered before, a step valuable to those who moved abroad as young adults who had never voted in UK elections. The secondary legislation enabling the vote went through on 18 December, a relief to those who had been let down by so many previous governments promising to enfranchise long-term British overseas residents. It also brings to an end an almost 20-year battle by the late Harry Shindler, who challenged the 15-year limit on voting rights in the high court in 2016. When successive governments failed to deliver on their manifesto promises he brought the case to the European court of justice. While he remained sceptical, he never gave up hope his campaign would finally bear fruit and in March 2022 declared his battle was “nearly over” when legislation was finally drafted and he lived to see it pass through parliament. The concept of a lifelong vote is not universally supported in parliament. Paul Scriven, a Liberal Democrat life peer, questioned how it could be right that someone who had not lived in the UK for 50 years could have a say in policies that did not directly affect them. Golding argues that Britons abroad are affected by many of the same electoral concerns as those living in the UK, including health and care for the elderly, education policy for overseas children sent to school or university in the UK and the immigration policy which impinges on non-British spouses."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak is facing a Conservative meltdown over the Rwanda deportation bill after two deputy chairs said they would support rebel amendments aimed at blocking international human rights laws. Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith have defied the prime minister by backing rightwing challenges to the bill, which will be debated by parliament on Tuesday. They will join as many as 70 other MPs said to be considering abstaining or opposing the controversial legislation. The high-profile rebellion on Monday evening of two “red wall” MPs will be regarded as a direct threat to Sunak’s authority. The prime minister will now have to contemplate sacking them from their party jobs. The move came as Sunak attempted to limit the damage to the safety of Rwanda bill by threatening to ignore injunctions from the European court of human rights that block deportation flights to Rwanda. Anderson, the MP for Ashfield who was appointed to the job last February, confirmed he will join a possible rebellion. He said he would be voting for amendments tabled by Robert Jenrick, who resigned as the immigration minister over the legislation, and the veteran Tory Sir Bill Cash. “The Rwanda Bill. I have signed the Cash & Jenrick amendments. I will vote for them,” he wrote on X. Clarke-Smith, the MP for Bassetlaw, also confirmed he would vote for rebel amendments. Asked if he would be sacked, he replied: “We’ll see. Not for me to decide.” They have been joined by Jane Stevenson, a parliamentary private secretary in the Department for Business and Trade, who also told a New Conservatives meeting she would back amendments. Simon Clarke, a Tory MP and close ally of Liz Truss, told the News Agents podcast that he was “minded as things stand today to vote against” the Rwanda bill as he does not “believe it will work”, adding: “We should not march the British public up that hill again.” Another Tory MP called for more rebels to back amendments to force Sunak from office. The former junior minister Andrea Jenkyns, who was sacked from government by Sunak, wrote on X: “Hopefully more to come and this will be accompanied with vote of no confidence letters to the 1922. So we can get a new and true Conservative leader.” Government insiders still believe they will get through committee stage of the bill on Tuesday without amendment, although the key third reading vote on Wednesday is a steeper challenge as it would take just 29 Tory MPs to rebel, or 57 abstain, for it to fail. One hardline source said that Downing Street is describing the right of the party as a spent force. “No 10 believes rebels are a ‘paper tiger’ and that they won’t follow through to vote against,” the source said.  A leading traditionalist figure said that they were surprised at the lack of movement from No 10. “There have been few, if any, attempts to reach out that I am aware of,” they said. “I think they may be underestimating the anger of backbenchers.” Sunak, the home secretary, James Cleverly, and government aides have spent the weeks since they narrowly avoided a major rebellion on the bill meeting with Tory MPs who believe it is riddled with loopholes and needs to be hardened up for them to back it. In a last-minute attempt to win over the party’s right, Sunak has toughened his rhetoric on rule 39, the so-called “pyjama injunctions” from the European court of human rights. Asked directly if he would overrule judges from Strasbourg, Sunak told GB News: “I won’t let a foreign court stop us from getting flights off and this deterrent working. “There’s a clause in the bill that says, very specifically, that it is for ministers to decide whether to comply with rule 39 rulings, as they’re called. I would not have put that clause in the bill if I was not prepared to use it. “Now, look, I don’t think Strasbourg will intervene because of the checks and balances in our system. And of course, there will be individual circumstances that people want us to consider on the facts. “But if you’re asking me, you know, are there circumstances in which I’m prepared to ignore those rule 39s? Then yes, of course there are.” In a further concession to the Tory right, No 10 has told MPs that Michael Tomlinson, the illegal immigration minister, will be appointed to handle any rulings from Strasbourg to ground flights. Sunak’s aides hope that giving the former deputy chair of the hardline European Research Group the responsibility will assuage concerns on the right that the rule 39 injunctions will automatically be followed. In an attempt to fast-track the process, the prime minister is reportedly planning to move 150 judges from the first tribunal to the upper tribunal, where they would hear appeals under the new law. Judges would also be paid extra to sit at evenings and weekends, the Times said. Sunak’s room for manoeuvre is further limited by threats from the One Nation bloc of more than 100 moderate MPs, who have warned that if he accepts any rightwing amendments the bill could be in breach of international law, a red line for the attorney general, Victoria Prentis, and the justice secretary, Alex Chalk. One former cabinet minister said: “If there’s any deals made with the right on amendments to the bill then we’re going to have a problem. If there’s any nonsense we’ll vote against it at third reading.” However, they added: “The whips aren’t suggesting that we’re in the territory of this being a confidence vote in the prime minister. But if the PM is in danger then the likes of me will probably do what we did last time and allow it to go through. “It won’t be with any enthusiasm but we recognise that there’s wider politics at play and it’s an election year.” Sunak has rejected the hardline, “full fat” version of the Rwanda bill advocated by the former home secretary Suella Braverman, Jenrick and the so-called “five families” of the Tory right caucuses. This would have resulted in all sections of the Human Rights Act being blocked and would have allowed ministers to ignore the European convention on human rights, denying people seeking asylum any chance to appeal against their deportation. Sunak does not want to pursue this option because he believes that it would be a breach of the UK’s legal obligations under the ECHR."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s campaign director has told fractious Conservative MPs to unite or face losing this year’s election in a blunt message designed to rally the backbenches before a long and gruelling campaign. Isaac Levido, the Australian political strategist, told MPs at the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives on Monday night they could still win the election, but only if they “get serious” and end party infighting. His comments were made before a series of crunch votes this week on the government’s Rwanda bill, which could mean dozens of Tory MPs rebelling to kill off Sunak’s signature migration policy. “Let me be clear: divided parties fail,” Levido told Tory MPs. “It’s time to get serious – I am fighting to win this election, and I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe it was possible. We all need to be fighting to win this election.” Levido, a protege of the veteran Australian strategist Lynton Crosby, began working in Downing Street at the beginning of the year as Sunak’s campaign chief. Last year he told Tories on an away day they had a “narrow path” to victory in 2024. But at the beginning of this year, with the party 18 points behind Labour in the polls, he has reportedly revised that assessment, telling officials the path is now “a bit narrower and a bit steeper”. Senior Tories credit Levido with a ferocious work ethic and the ability to pick a single campaign theme and stick to it. His arrival at No 10 has coincided with a switch in strategy from painting Sunak as a reforming prime minister who can tackle 30 years of government failure, to depicting him instead as the guardian of a fragile national recovery. His message was undermined on Monday morning, however, by the publication of a dramatic poll in the Telegraph showing the Tories heading for a 1997-style landslide defeat. Levido told MPs on Monday to ignore the poll, which showed the party slumping to just 169 seats while Labour sweeps to power with 385. And he accused those behind it, including the Boris Johnson ally Lord Frost, of trying to undermine the government. “The people who organised this poll and analysed and timed the release of it seem to be intent on undermining this government and our party, and therefore the re-election prospects of every single one of you in this room,” he said. “They seem to be throwing in the towel, and are more interested in what happens after the election rather than fighting it – making the pathway narrower and steeper.” MPs at the briefing emerged looking grim-faced, but praised Levido’s clarity of vision. Asked whether his message had been optimistic or pessimistic, one replied: “Realistic.”"

        "content": "The marketing apparatchiks have taken to calling it Blue Monday. That day in January when you are generally feeling about as bad as you are ever going to feel all year. Anxious, depressed and broke. A time to go heavy on the Valium and Prozac. Just try to get through to better days relatively unscathed. Rishi Sunak doesn’t have to worry about being short of cash. He’s got more than he can reasonably spend in any number of lifetimes. But he’s sure as hell buying whatever else is on offer. Because days don’t come much bluer than this Blue Monday. He’d always imagined he’d be a brilliant prime minister. Not because he had the necessary qualities but because everyone has always said he’s brilliant whatever he’s done. He’s Mr Brilliant. The Entitled One. Only being prime minister has been a lot tougher than he imagined. You can’t get away by just sprinkling random stardust. The world has not bent to his will. He has been found out. Four of his five pledges in tatters. The other one – inflation – irrelevant; it was never in his gift anyway. Nor does he have the common touch, an easy way of connecting with people with whom he has nothing in common. Instead Rish! regards them as aliens. As they do him. And on Monday a new verdict came in via an opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph: the Tories were facing electoral annihilation. This was not exactly news. Other polls had more or less predicted this. But this one was a wee bit special. Its sample was large and it was published in the Conservative party’s daily prayer book. The word of God. Voters didn’t like Sunak and they didn’t like his policies. After 14 years, almost everyone had had enough: they didn’t feel better off and the country was falling apart. The Conservatives had no one to blame but themselves. And everything was about to get a whole lot worse. Because later in the week, parliament would be voting on his small boats Rwanda bill. With a significant number of rightwing Tory MPs desperate to force through amendments to make it even more punitive, and a small number of moderates squeaking that “enough was enough”. Something would have to give. No one was quite sure what. It all felt a bit like the end of days. So Sunak began Blue Monday with a pointless trip to Essex. Probably his therapist had recommended it. “If you’re feeling as if the world is against you and you just can’t cope then try to get out of bed and do something. Anything. It doesn’t matter what. You’ll start to feel better about yourself.” At least that was the hope. Fake it to Make it. Um, the polls are just polls, he said to a passing TV camera. Let’s wait and see what happens in the election. He was fooling no one. Because if he really believed that he wouldn’t be delaying the election till the end of the year. Most Tories are under the weird misapprehension that what’s really holding them back is that they aren’t even more rightwing. There’s no accounting for crass stupidity. “Stick with change,” he added. This was a car crash. The wheels had long since fallen off. Either you’re the continuity man or you’re the change candidate. You can’t be both. The truth is he’s neither. Just a piece of electoral jetsam, spat out by the Tories. Someone is going to have to rethink the messaging yet again. Not that it will make any difference. Still, Rish! had a slightly better time of it in the afternoon when he made a statement to the Commons about the military action taken against the Houthis last Thursday. Largely because it is one of the few things on which every Tory MP – and most Labour MPs, come to think of it – can agree. The man who has spent the past 12 months getting so much wrong has finally done something right. Or right-ish. For all his many faults, Sunak is not a man to casually take us to war like an unserious David Cameron. He will have agonised about this. The Commons was unusually full for a Monday afternoon. Maybe there are more MPs than we think who suffer from seasonal affective disorder and need to get out more. Even Matt Hancock was there, with trademark pink tie dangling. I wish he’d have his midlife crisis somewhere else. But then he’s there to serve. Yawn. Lord Big Dave couldn’t be bothered to show up and watch from the peers’ gallery. Probably still trying to find Yemen on the map. Sunak began by saying this had been a limited, targeted strike. It was done entirely in self-defence and had nothing to do with the fighting in Israel and Gaza. This sounded like wishful thinking. The Houthis are funded by Iran, which is desperate to cause unrest in the Middle East. Pretending that this isn’t the case and that the Houthis have just started attacking shipping for target practice is expedient at best. Then it helps to keep things binary. After all, sitting back and doing nothing when British ships come under attack also isn’t an option. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Keir Starmer offered unequivocal support. Though he did ask with what confidence Sunak could say his objectives had been met. Rish! wisely chose not to answer. The Houthis are used to being attacked – the Saudis have been bombing them for a decade – so one limited strike isn’t going to cause them to lose much sleep. No one dared to say what would happen when the Houthis and Iran recommenced their attacks. Every Tory MP agreed that the attack had been just what was needed, though some wondered why the navy hadn’t taken more of a central role. It could be because we don’t really have much of a navy: our two aircraft carriers are in dock in the UK. Even the members of the Labour awkward squad – Apsana Begum, Zarah Sultana et al – weren’t that awkward. Nor was Jeremy Corbyn. They just wanted more recognition that everything in the Middle East was connected. You didn’t get to choose what was and wasn’t an isolated incident. Sunak didn’t bite, though. Nor did he seem that bothered by the mounting death toll in Israel and Gaza. Maybe that’s last year’s war. In any case, I guess he’d got other things to worry about on Blue Monday. Roll on the Rwanda bill."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has said the UK is willing to take military action against Houthi rebels again, hours after the Yemen-based group fired another missile at a container ship in the Red Sea.\nThe prime minister addressed MPs on Monday for the first time since the UK took part in airstrikes on the Houthis on Friday night, which he said destroyed 13 targets at two sites, including drones, an airfield and a cruise missile launcher.\nHe defended the decision to launch the strikes without parliament’s approval, and warned the UK could launch more if the rebels continued to hold hostages and posed a threat to international shipping in the region.\nSunak told the Commons: “This action was taken in self-defence. It was limited, not escalatory. It was a necessary and proportionate response to a direct threat to UK vessels and therefore to the UK itself.”\nBut he added: “The threats to shipping must cease. Illegally detained vessels and crews must be released. And we remain prepared to back our words with actions.”\nThe prime minister’s comments bolster those made earlier on Monday by the defence secretary who told an audience in central London that the UK did not intend to launch another attack but could do so if necessary.\nGrant Shapps said: “Although this was a distinct piece of precisely targeted military action, we will not put up with a major waterway, major shipping lanes being closed on a permanent basis.”\nOn Friday 10 countries, led by the US, joined forces to strike the Houthis, who promptly promised to retaliate. On Sunday the US said one of its fighter jets had shot down a missile aimed at one of its warships in the region, and on Monday it said the Houthis had fired on a US-operated container ship.\nThe strikes were welcomed by Britain’s main opposition parties, including Labour, whose leader, Keir Starmer, told MPs on Monday: “The UK strikes were limited, targeted and did everything possible to protect civilian lives. That is a proportionate response.”\nHowever, several MPs questioned why parliament was not recalled to debate the action first.\nEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, called the lack of a parliamentary debate “regrettable”, while Starmer said: “Scrutiny is not the enemy of strategy.”\nSunak said he remained committed to the idea of consulting parliament before taking sustained military action, a principle that was set with the parliamentary vote on the Iraq war and prevented the government taking action in Syria in 2013.\n“It was necessary to strike at speed … to protect the security of these operations,” the prime minister said. “That is in accordance with the convention and I remain committed to that convention and would always look to follow appropriate processes and procedures and also act in line with precedent.”\nSome MPs said western strikes on Houthi targets risked escalating the crisis in the Middle East.\nThe Labour MP Zarah Sultana said: “Military intervention starting out as limited can quickly escalate, risking a sequence of events far larger and more terrible, and risk even dragging us into war.”\nSunak rejected what he called the “malign narrative” that the attacks in the Red Sea were connected to the Israel-Gaza conflict. But he added that he would speak to other world leaders in the region to make sure they did not interpret the international strikes as seeking to intervene in that war.\n“There will be maligned forces out there that seek to distort our action to turn it into something that it is not,” he said. “It’s important that we engage with our allies and those others in the region so they understand what we did and why.”"

In a statement to MPs, he said people should not believe “the malign narrative that this is about Israel and Gaza”. The Houthis were attacking ships from all over the world, he said. (See 3.42pm.)\n\n\nSunak has said that his government is willing to ignore injunctions from the European court of human rights (ECHR) that block deportation flights to Rwanda. He made the comment ahead of votes on the Rwanda bill in the Commons tomorrow and on Wednesday, in an attempt to reassure Tory MPs who complain the bill as drafted does not make it clear that these injunctions will be ignored. This is one of several issues where rightwingers are trying to toughen the bill. But No 10 has signalled that it is opposed to significant amendments. (See 2.31pm.)\n\n\nKeir Starmer has told Labour members they should ignore a poll saying the party is on course to win by a landslide and instead “fight like we’re 5% behind”. (See 12.26pm.) Labour’s national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, made the same point in a post on X.\n\n\n\nLabour candidates and members should ignore this poll. Fight like we are behind. Fight like every vote matters. Change will only come for the country if people vote for it, and not a single vote has been cast. https://t.co/9o5vYWkvER— Pat McFadden (@patmcfaddenmp) January 15, 2024\n\n\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir will be banned from organising in the UK following claims that the group is antisemitic, James Cleverly, the home secretary, has said.\n\n\nTrain drivers have called a further week of rolling strikes across England from late January in their long-running dispute with operators over pay.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.44pm GMT\n\n\n 5.13pm GMT \nNorthern Ireland set for largest ever public sector strike as pay awards held up over deadlock at Stormont\n\nHealth trust bosses in Northern Ireland have warned that mass strike action planned for the region on Thursday will have a “profound impact” on services, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe chief executives of the five hospital trusts and the Northern Ireland ambulance service said the disruption will be on a “massive and unprecedented scale”, with a best-case scenario resulting in a service similar to that offered on Christmas Day.\nWorkers are demanding that a pay award made to counterparts elsewhere in the UK is introduced in Northern Ireland.\nThe strike by health workers on Thursday will be part of the largest public sector strike in Northern Ireland’s history when workers with 15 trade unions will take part in industrial action also covering education and the civil service.\nThe Stormont assembly is to be recalled later this week in a bid to back a motion to endorse fair pay settlements for the public sector workers.\nThe recall petition tabled by Sinn Féin received the required 30 MLA signatures. But several previous attempts to reconstitute the assembly have already failed as the DUP has not supported the election of a speaker at the outset of the sittings. The DUP has been boycotting power sharing for almost two years as a protest against the Northern Ireland protocol.\nIn December, the UK government offered the parties a £3.3bn package to stabilise finances in Northern Ireland, including £600m to settle public sector pay claims. However, it is dependent on the Stormont institutions being restored.\nThe Northern Ireland parties want Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, to release the funds for the public sector pay awards immediately. But the Northern Ireland Office says he has no authority to negotiate pay in the region as it is a devolved matter for the Stormont parties.\nHeaton-Harris met Northern Irish leaders today and afterwards Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said Heaton-Harris should increase public sector pay. “You don’t need to have a functioning Stormont in order for the secretary of state to use the temporary powers that he has given to himself for that purpose,” Donaldson said.\nMichelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland and first minister designate, said it was becoming “increasingly untenable” for the DUP to refuse to enter power-sharing over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nThe BBC has a good live blog with more on what happened at today’s talks here.\n\nUpdated at 5.22pm GMT\n\n\n 4.34pm GMT \n\nJohn McDonnell (Lab) says even though the PM is not linking this to Gaza, the longer the Gaza conflict goes on, the more instability there is in the region. He says 7,000 Palestinian children have been killed. What is the PM doing to stop this?\nSunak says the UK has repeatedly urged Israel to minimise civilian casualties.\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm GMT\n\n\n 4.29pm GMT \n\nCaroline Lucas (Green) says many people in the region will conclude the UK was intervening on the side of Israel.\nSunak says the UK acted as a last resort. It would help if parliament spoke with one voice, he says, so people know this had nothing to do with Israel and Gaza.\n\n\n\n 4.28pm GMT \n\nZarah Sultana (Lab) claims Foreign Office officials were nervous about last week’s military attack. She asks if Sunak will seek to de-escalate the situation by calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nSunak says Sultana should be asking Hamas and the Houthis to call a ceasefire.\n\nUpdated at 4.52pm GMT\n\n\n 4.25pm GMT \nSunak condemns pro-Houthi chanting during protest marches in Britain\n\nAlex Davies-Jones (Lab) asks the PM to condemn the pro-Houthi chanting heard during protests in the UK at the weekend. She says they are an antisemitic terrorist group.\nSunak welcomes what Davies-Jones says. He says the police should take decisive action against people promoting terrorism or inciting hate.\nUPDATE: Davies-Jones said:\n\nThe Houthis are an antisemitic terrorist group that have caused havoc in Yemen over the past decade, starting a civil war that has killed over 350,000 people. Its slogan includes the lines ‘Death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews’. Will the prime minister join me in condemning the shameful pro-Houthi chanting that we saw at many protests in the UK over the weekend?\n\nAnd Sunak replied: \n\nCan I commend the honourable lady for her remarks and can I wholeheartedly agree with her. We will absolutely not tolerate that kind of language on our streets, we have been crystal clear about that.\nWe’ve said to the police that they should take all decisive action against those that promote and encourage terrorism, and indeed those that incite hatred and division on our streets.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.20pm GMT\n\n\n 4.20pm GMT \n\nJeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, says there are 17 million people in the region of Yemen living in hunger. Where is the comprehensive plan by western nations to bring peace to the region?\nSunak says he does have hope. As the UK and others take action to degrade the capacity of malign actors in the region, that will give space for positive voices.\nHe says the UK is providing aid in the region, helping 100,000 people a month.\nAnd the attacks on shipping are disrupting supplies of food to Yemen, he says.\nUPDATE: Corbyn said:\n\nRather than pumping more and more weapons and money into more and more conflicts, which will get worse, does [Sunak] have any hope for the future that there will be a lessening of conflict rather than the present, very rapid, increase in it?\n\nIn response, Sunak said: \n\nI do have hope, and that’s because as we and others take action to degrade and disrupt the capability of those who are malign actors in the region, that will actually give the space for positive voices to build the peace that all of us want to see and to allow everyone to live side by side with dignity and security and opportunity.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.22pm GMT\n\n\n 4.10pm GMT \n\nApsana Begum (Lab) said 71% of the public want a ceasefire in Gaza. She said Sunak had a duty to the public to allow a vote on military action.\nSunak said Begum was wrong to conflate the action against the Houthis with the Israel/Gaza conflict.\n\n\n\n 4.07pm GMT \n\nLiz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Wesminster, says she represents a constituency (Dwyfor Meirionnydd) with a proud maritime tradition. She says shipping staff need to be protected. But how will dropping bombs de-escalate the situation?\nSunak says Roberts’ question is “extraordinary”. He says the rockets being fired at ships are threatening seafarers.\n\n\n\n 4.00pm GMT \n\nEd Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says that while not having a Commons vote was regrettable, his party supports the strikes.\nBut the region is a tinderbox, he says. What will be done to ensure these actions remain limited?\nSunak says there is no linkage between direct action in self-defence against the Houthis, and Israel and Gaza.\n\nUpdated at 4.03pm GMT\n\n\n 3.58pm GMT \n\nSunak is responding to Flynn.\nHe says he won’t speculate on what will happen in the future. But he says it would have been very dangerous to have done nothing, because that would have implied British ships were “fair game”.\n\n\n\n 3.56pm GMT \n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks what the government will do if the Houthis ignore the airstrikes.\nThe PM should be willing to say how far he is willing to go, he says.\nHe says there is a risk of escalation. A ceasefire in Gaza is essential for regional stability, he says.\nThe Commons should have been recalled, he says. That is what the public expected, and the PM should do better in future, he says.\n\nUpdated at 4.02pm GMT\n\n\n 3.54pm GMT \n\nSunak is responding to Starmer. He thanks him for his support.\nHe says the aim was to disrupt and degrade the Houthis’ capabilities. The initial assessment is that that was achieved, he says.\nHe says it is incumbent on the Houthis not to escalate this.\nIt was necessary to strike at speed, he says.

He said the airstrikes were proportionate.\nBut he said it was the role of the Commons to ask the right questions, and he posed four:\n\nWhat made the PM confident his objectives had been met?\nWhat would he do if there were more attacks?\nWhat would he do to maintain the support of the international community?\nAnd would he stand by the convention that, where possible, MPs should vote on military interventions, particularly if they are part of a sustained campaign?\n\nStarmer stressed Labour’s support for Ukraine.\nAnd he called for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nUpdated at 3.53pm GMT\n\n\n 3.43pm GMT \n\nSunak finished his statement by referring to Ukraine, which he visited on Friday, and he restated Britain’s support for it in its war against Russia.\n\nUpdated at 3.53pm GMT\n\n\n 3.42pm GMT \nSunak dismisses 'malign narrative' claiming airstrikes against Houthis were part of Israel-Gaza war\n\nSunak starts by saying the Houthis attacked British and American warships on 9 January, after other attacks on commercial shipping. It was “the biggest attack on the Royal Navy for decades”, he says.\nHe says the UK, with the US, retaliated in self-defence, and to uphold freedom of navigation, as Britain has always done.\n\nI do not take decisions on the use of force lightly. That is why I stress that this action was taken in self-defence. It was limited, not escalatory.\nIt was a necessary and proportionate response to a direct threat to UK vessels and therefore to the UK itself.\n\nHe says the initial assessment is that all 13 targets of the airstrikes were successfully hit. And there is no evidence of civilian casualties, he says. Great care was taken to avoid them, he says.\nHe says, in protecting international shipping, the UK is upholding international law.\nThe Houthis’ attacks on international shipping have put innocent lives at risk, he says. They have held one crew hostage for almost two months and they are causing growing economic disruption. Global commerce cannot operate under such conditions. Containers and tankers are having to take a 5,000-mile detour around the Cape of Good Hope.\nThis is pushing up prices, and reducing consumers’ access to vital goods, he says.\nAnd he says people should not accept the “malign narrative” that this is about Israel and Gaza. It isn’t, he says; it is about protecting shipping.\nUPDATE: Sunak said:\n\nWe shouldn’t fall for [the Houthis’] malign narrative that this is about Israel and Gaza. They target ships from around the world.\nAnd we continue to work towards a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza and to get more aid to civilians. We also continue to support a negotiated settlement in Yemen’s civil war.\nBut I want to be very clear that this action is completely unrelated to those issues.\nIt is a direct response to the Houthis’ attacks on international shipping.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.04pm GMT\n\n\n 3.32pm GMT \nRishi Sunak makes Commons statement on airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen\n\nRishi Sunak is about to give his Commons statement on the airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nHere is the statement No 10 issued about them on Friday.\n\nUpdated at 3.37pm GMT\n\n\n 3.30pm GMT \n\nSam Freedman, the Prospect columnist, has a good thread on X on the YouGov polling too.

It arguably goes a bit further than what he has said on this in the past, but not as far as some of his MPs want.\nThe ECtHR can issue injunctions under rule 39 stopping member states from taking action until a legal challenge has been resolved, and an order of this kind blocked the government’s first planned deportation flight to Rwanda in 2022.\nClause 5 of the new bill says it is for a UK government minister to decide whether or not to comply with a rule 39 order. Tory rightwingers want the bill to say explicitly that the government should ignore rule 39 orders, but it has been reported that Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, believes that if a minister does ignore one of these injunctions, they will be in breach of international law.\nSunak has often said he will not let a foreign court stop Britain from getting flights to Rwanda off the ground. Today he repeated that, but he went a bit further, telling GB News:\n\nThere’s a clause in the bill that says, very specifically, that it is for ministers to decide whether to comply with rule 39 rulings as they’re called, I would not have put that clause in the bill if I was not prepared to use it.\nNow, look, I don’t think Strasbourg will intervene because of the checks and balances in our system. And of course, there will be individual circumstances that people want us to consider on the facts.\nBut if you’re asking me, you know, are there circumstances in which I’m prepared to ignore those rule 39s? Then yes, of course there are.\n\nMore than 40 Tory MPs, including the former PM Liz Truss, have signed an amendment to the bill (amendment 23) tabled by Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, that would add a clause to the bill saying rule 39 orders are not binding on the UK and should not prevent deportations to Rwanda.\nIn a briefing paper on the bill, the House of Commons library says that if a minister ignored an injunction from the Strasbourg court, the UK would be in breach of its treaty obligations. It says:\n\nIf a minister decided to exercise the power not to comply with interim measures, a person could be removed to Rwanda while their case was being decided by the ECtHR. This would be so even if they faced a real risk of serious and irreparable harm.\nThis would place the UK in breach of its treaty obligations under the ECHR [European convention on human rights].\nThere are few precedents for this situation. The Polish government recently informed the ECtHR that interim measures issued in a case concerning the transfer of judges to alternative posts against their will would not be complied with. This was based in part on a decision by the constitutional tribunal which questioned the authority of the ECtHR to assess the compliance of laws concerning the judiciary, saying it was incompatible with the constitution. It has been reported that France recently deported a person suspected of involvement in terrorism in defiance of interim measures issued by the ECtHR.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.37pm GMT\n\n\n 2.30pm GMT \n\n\nUpdated at 3.43pm GMT\n\n\n 2.09pm GMT \nIslamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir to be banned from organising in UK\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir will be banned from organising in the UK following claims that the group is antisemitic, James Cleverly, the home secretary, has said.

But, by refusing to use the word “sorry”, he came over as defensive and unsympathetic. Cameron, one of the most skilled communicators in government, managed to sound a lot more empathic even though, like Davey, he was not really accepting that he did anything wrong.\n\n\nEXCL: In his first in-depth interview, Sir Ed Davey refuses to apologise for his part in the Horizon scandal.When asked more than 10 times, he says he “regrets” being lied to on an “industrial scale”, but won’t go as far as to say “sorry”. pic.twitter.com/NRHdUFCWHR— Paul Brand (@PaulBrandITV) January 12, 2024\n\n\nAsked if the PM agreed with Cameron that all politicians involved in this in the past 20 years should be sorry, the spokesperson replied:\n\nOf course.

He said:\n\n\nToday, for the very first time, this government is spending more than £50bn a year on defence in cash terms, more than ever before.\nAnd we have made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5% of GDP spent on defence.\nAnd as we stabilise and grow the economy, we will continue to strive to reach it as soon as possible.\nBut now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same.\nAnd ensure their defence spending is growing.\nBecause, as discussed, the era of the peace dividend is over.\nIn five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.\nAsk yourselves – looking at today’s conflicts across the world - is it more likely that the number grows, or reduces?\nI suspect we all know the answer – it’s likely to grow. So, 2024 must mark an inflexion point.\n\n\nHe said the UK should make its defence industry more resilient.

He explained:\n\n\nOur decisive response in the Red Sea and our uplift in support for Ukraine offers a direct blueprint for how the UK must continue to lead in the future, offering our unwavering support to our allies in times of struggle, galvanising global response to any malign actors seeking to break rules-based international order and acting decisively when the moment calls for us to defend ourselves. Deter and lead.\n\n\nHe said the attacks were a “last resort”. He said:\n\n\nIt’s right that we took proportionate, targeted action against military targets to send a strong message that that behaviour is unacceptable.\nIt was a last resort, it came after the end of exhaustive diplomatic activity including a UN security council.\n\n\nHe said the airstrikes were intended as a “single action”. He said:\n\n\nWe have hit the Houthis, we intend it as a single action. We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.\n\n\nAnd he said “different factors” would determine whether there were further airstrikes. Asked if there was an “acceptable” level of interference with shipping in the Red Sea, he replied:\n\n\nWhat’s acceptable? Clearly nothing’s acceptable. What will bring action, we’ll watch very carefully, we’ll look at the patterns of what’s happening. We’ll check the capability.\nWe’ll, in particular, be interested to see those links between Tehran and the Houthis. We’re monitoring whether there are shipments or whether we detect intelligence and the rest of it.\nSo, there are a lot of different factors that we’ll take into account along with our coalition partners, the Americans in particular.\nThis isn’t a precise recipe, but what I can tell you is, overall, we’ve made the point very clearly that although this was a distinct piece of precisely targeted military action, we will not put up with a major waterway, major shipping lanes, being closed on a permanent basis.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.17pm GMT\n\n\n 11.40am GMT \nSunak refuses to say if Lee Anderson will be sacked as Tory deputy chair if he votes against government on Rwanda bill\n\nIn his pooled TV clip this morning, Rishi Sunak refused to say whether he would sack Lee Anderson as the Tory deputy chair if he votes against the government on the Rwanda bill.

I’m confident that the bill we’ve got is the toughest that anyone has ever seen and it will resolve this issue once and for all.\n\nAnderson is not a government frontbencher but, as a party deputy chair, he is considered part of the payroll vote and is expected to vote with the government as a condition for keeping his job.\n\nUpdated at 11.51am GMT\n\n\n 11.15am GMT \nSunak plays down significance of polling suggesting he is on course to lose election by landslide\n\nRishi Sunak was asked about the YouGov poll suggesting Labour is on course for a landslide election win (see 9.29am and 9.56am) while on a visit in Essex this morning. Rolling out a time-honoured formula used by politicians facing similar polling numbers, he said the only poll that mattered was “the one when the general election comes”. He went on:\n\nThere have been lots of polls over the last year, there will be hundreds more polls.\nThe choice at that election is clear, it’s stick with our plan that is working, it’s delivering change for people, ensuring they can have the peace of mind that there is a brighter future for their children and we can have renewed pride in our country.\n\nThis morning, asked whether the Tories could turn things round, Grant Shapps, replied:\n\nAbsolutely.

It is to be as tough as it takes on immigration, reverse the debilitating increases in tax, end the renewables tax on energy costs – and much more.\n\n(By my count, that is more than “one way” – but never mind.)\nLord Frost is not the only rightwing Tory putting pressure on Rishi Sunak ahead of the votes on the Rwanda bill tomorrow and on Wednesday.\nLee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, has reportedly said he will vote for the rightwing rebel amendments, as Aletha Adu reports here.\n\n Related: Up to 70 Tory rebels could abstain or back amendments to Rwanda bill \n\nThe Times quotes an MP who has spoken to Anderson as saying: “He has said to the whips that he will definitely vote for the amendments and that either the government must support them or lose him as deputy chairman.”\nAnd, in the Times, Matt Dathan and Oliver Wright say Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, has told No 10 that she agrees with the rebels in wanting to amend the bill to limit the ability of asylum seekers to lodge individual appeals against orders deporting them to Rwanda. They say:\n\nThe Times also understands that Badenoch, the business secretary, urged the prime minister to harden up the legislation by stopping migrants lodging individual appeals against their deportation. She met Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, in No 10 last month to warn of the political consequences of failing to block individual legal challenges.\nA source said: “Kemi was aware that the prime minister faced a serious rebellion and he had to try and accommodate them, so she went in to see Liam. She was trying to avoid the rebel MPs turning against the government.”\nBadenoch is understood to have argued in favour of limiting individual appeals being lodged by migrants to only the most exceptional of circumstances.\n\nBadenoch is the clear favourite to be the next Conservative leader, and it must help her chances for members to know that she sides with the rebels on this issue (even if there is no suggestion that she will rebel, or resign, over the issue).\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm GMT\n\n\n 10.00am GMT \nUK ‘will wait and see’ before deciding on further Houthi strikes, Shapps says\n\nThe UK has no interest in taking part in any wider conflict in Yemen but is “waiting to see what happens” before deciding whether further military strikes against Houthi forces might be needed, Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, has said. Peter Walker has the story.\n\n Related: UK ‘will wait and see’ before deciding on further Houthi strikes \n\n\n\n\n 9.56am GMT \nYouGov rejects claim its poll shows, without Reform UK standing in election, Labour would fail to win majority\n\nHere is an extract from Gordon Rayner’s Telegraph splash reporting the YouGov MRP poll findings.\nAlthough the publication of the poll seems primarily intended to pressurise Rishi Sunak into adopting a toughter stance on the Rwanda bill (see 9.29am), the Tories behind it may be hoping it encourages Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, to think twice about his pledge to stand candidates in every constituency in Britain. The Telegraph says its analysis of the polling suggests, without Reform UK on the ballot, Labour would fail to win a majority.\nRayner says:\n\nThe Conservatives are heading for an electoral wipeout on the scale of their 1997 defeat by Labour, the most authoritative opinion poll in five years has predicted.\nThe YouGov survey of 14,000 people forecasts that the Tories will retain just 169 seats, while Labour will sweep to power with 385 – giving Sir Keir Starmer a 120-seat majority.\nEvery Red Wall seat won from Labour by Boris Johnson in 2019 will be lost, the poll indicates, and the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will be one of 11 Cabinet ministers to lose their seats …\nThe poll exposes the huge influence that Reform UK is set to have on the election result. The Right-wing party would not win any seats, but support for it would be the decisive factor in 96 Tory losses – the difference between a Labour majority and a hung parliament.\nThe result would be the biggest collapse in support for a governing party since 1906, with an 11.5 per cent swing to Labour.\n\nAnd here are three of the Telegraph graphics illustrating the figures in the polling.\nUPDATE: YouGov says it does not agree with the Telegraph claim about Labour not being on course for a majority if Reform UK were to stand aside. (See 10.46am.)\n\nUpdated at 11.57am GMT\n\n\n 9.29am GMT \nGrant Shapps dismisses significance of Tory-backed poll suggesting Labour on course for landslide election win\n\nGood morning. News organisations, including the Guardian, tend to be a bit wary of splashing on opinion polls. Polls are never 100% reliable, there is a good case for saying they constrain political reporting (because if journalists assume X can’t win, they don’t cover very seriously what X might do if they were to win), and in 2015, 2016 and 2017 most polls turned out in essence to be wrong, which delivered a big blow to the credibility of the industry.\nBut politicians have never stopped commissioning and studying them, and recently polling has had a much better record. Newspapers are still a bit cautious about using them, but today the Daily Telegraph is splashing on a YouGov MRP poll saying that Labour is on course to win by a landslide.\n\n\n📰The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph:'Tories facing 1997-style wipeout'#TomorrowsPapersTodaySign up for the Front Page newsletter⬇️https://t.co/x8AV4OoUh6 pic.twitter.com/1jTi5iXDiX— The Telegraph (@Telegraph) January 14, 2024\n\n\nTo anyone who has read almost any poll over the past year or so, and tried to work out what it would mean for a general election result (the Electoral Calculus seat predictor website is a good starting point) this does not count as news at all. The Telegraph’s YouGov poll says Labour is on course for a majority of 120. It points to Labour winning 385 seats, and many polls recently have suggested Keir Starmer will win by even more. Electoral Calculus’s own figure for Labour MPs after the election is currently 412.\nBut, still, this one is worth paying attention to, for three reasons.\n1) The Telegraph argues it is “the most authoritative’” poll in five years. “Most authoritative” might be pushing it too far, but this seems to be a serious operation. YouGov is a very well respected polling organisation, and the polling is based on a survey of 14,000 people. MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification) is a technique that uses polling to predict results on a seat-by-seat basis, using detailed demographic data and voting trends, and it is now seen as the polling gold standard. YouGov’s MRP poll before the 2017 general election was the best guide to the result from a polling company (although, because the technique was novel at the time, and untested, YouGov did not publicise it very aggressively). (Its final MRP poll before the 2019 election was less accurate, predicting a small Tory majority, not a near landslide.)\n2) The Telegraph is, in effect, the Conservative party’s in-house newspaper, and today’s splash will puncture the “narrow path to victory” some Tory MPs convey about their election prospects (in public at least).\n3) The poll has been published with an agenda. The Telegraph says it has been funded by a group of Tory donors called “the Conservative Britain Alliance”. No one has ever heard of them, but it seems fair to assume they are not Rishi Sunak supporters. The Telegraph also carries a front page article by David Frost, the former Brexit minister, in which he says he was “involved in shaping and analysing” the poll (there is no evidence that Lord Frost has any expertise in psephology). In his article Frost says the only solution for the Tories is to be “as tough as it takes on immigration”.\nTomorrow, MPs will start two days of debate on the Rwanda bill, which will see dozens of rightwingers try to toughen up the bill by making it even less compatible with international law than it already is. The Frost article implies the poll is part of a last-minute lobbying effort to get Sunak to comply with their demands.\nAll the signs, so far, are that he won’t. It is thought the Tory rebels do not have the numbers to vote down the bill at third reading, on Wednesday evening, but even if Sunak gets his bill through the Commons, he won’t have a united party behind him.\nGrant Shapps, the defence secretary, was doing an interview round this morning. Asked about the Telegraph splash, he deployed the usual politician’s response to unfavourable polling, and claimed things might change by the time of the election. He told Times Radio:\n\nIf you take a poll now, you are not going to get the same answer as a poll when, for example, things like the tax cut – £450 for a person on the average salary right now – people are feeling that because they have then had it in their pay packet for several months, for example, with inflation at these much lower rates, with growth in the economy. With all of these factors, I think they take time to feed through.\n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\nMorning: Rishi Sunak is on a visit in Essex.\nMorning: Keir Starmer is on a visit in north London.\n9.40am: Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, gives a speech at Lancaster House.\n10am: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, holds talks at Hillsborough Castle with the Northern Ireland parties about resuming power sharing.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n11.30am: Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, speaks about the government’s plans for post-15 educational reform at an event organised by the Bright Blue thinktank.\n2.30pm: James Cleverly, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\nAfter 3.30pm: Rishi Sunak is due to make a statement to MPs on the missile attacks against the Houthis.\nAnd in Wales, junior doctors are starting a three-day strike.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "Frances Ryan is right to highlight the increasing consensus between Labour and the Tories on cutting taxation, including its negative consequences for much-needed investment in public services and the reduction of destitution, poverty and inequality (I believe taxation is a great public good, but I look at my tax return and ask: what are we paying for?, 11 January). Adopting this government’s approach to fiscal responsibility, as Labour seem set on, will only widen inequalities and its damaging consequences for children’s health, education and wellbeing, as comprehensively evidenced by Sir Michael Marmot’s 2020 review. And what is so blinkered is Labour’s failure to engage the public with the short- and longer-term personal and economic costs of maintaining the status quo on taxation. Even a modest approach to progressive taxation would provide the funding to shift Labour’s policy agenda from piecemeal tinkering to reform, from rationing to needs-led public services – offering a progressive vision to win the hearts and minds of the electorate. Prof Mike Stein University of York  • I share Frances Ryan’s indignation at the government and the opposition’s refusal to raise more taxes from the wealthy and affluent in order to rebuild our public services and reduce poverty. I can’t for the life of me see why such callousness should be a vote-winner. However, it also baffles me that no one seems to question the recent hikes in UK military spending, which, between 2020 and 2025, will be the largest sustained increase for 30 years: spending which fuels the devastation of lives and of our already fragile and polluted planet. What our country needs is a government of national unity, to create a radical rescue plan for the UK and beyond: one in which those who have the most will contribute the most, for the benefit of us all. Diana Francis Bath • So, ending non-dom tax status will fund 700,000 dental appointments and help correct the tragic state of dentistry in the UK (Britain has suffered terribly under these Tories, especially our children. The only word for it is neglect, 10 January). It will also enable free breakfast clubs in primary schools and address the worsening ill health of children. Do the figures stack up? Well, I hope so. But what of our decrepit public services, our diminished NHS, lack of care for elderly people, etc? Frances Ryan in her piece correctly challenges the failure of Keir Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to raise the tax levels of the wealthy as part of a renewal programme – and, I might add, to explain clearly to the public why this is essential. As she says, growth alone won’t solve “broken Britain”.  Ending non-dom status of the rich simply won’t solve the multiple issues a Labour government will need to address. Raising taxes from the top 5% certainly could. Time for some honesty and transparency. Jol Miskin Sheffield • Regarding Frances Ryan’s piece on taxation, according to the Office for National Statistics, the combined gross annual income of the top 1% of earners in the UK was £605.5bn in 2020. Given the mess that Labour is likely to inherit, why not ask this top 1% to donate one year of their annual income to the Treasury – given their wealth, this is hardly likely to affect their standard of living, and the contribution to the public good would be their reward.

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-15T12:49:25+00:00",
        "content": "For Conservative MPs opening their Daily Telegraph on Monday morning it was a distinctly gloomy start to the week: a mega-poll suggesting they are heading for a crashing general election defeat. And this was arguably an optimistic take. For one thing, some pollsters believe the YouGov conclusion of a 120-seat Labour majority could be an underestimate. Additionally, the poll’s organisers seem intent on using its findings to push the party further to the right on immigration, a move that will dismay many centrist Tories, and seems unlikely to stop the rot. The notable aspects of the poll come in two main parts. The first is its findings: YouGov surveyed 14,000 people and extrapolated the results to constituencies using the multilevel regression and poststratification model, or MRP. This predicted that the Conservatives would retain only 169 seats, 196 fewer than their 2019 total, while Labour would take 385, the Liberal Democrats 48 and the SNP 25. This would be a disaster for the Conservatives, resulting in 11 current cabinet ministers losing their seats, among them Jeremy Hunt, Grant Shapps and Gillian Keegan. But it could – and might – be worse. Rob Ford, a professor of politics at Manchester University, noted that the YouGov modelling appeared to play down the effect of tactical voting in many seats where Conservative MPs were at risk of challenge. “It doesn’t seem very credible to me that in a Tory-Lib Dem marginal, 10% of people would still support Green, and not care either way about the opportunity to get rid of a Conservative MP. It does suggest that things could be even worse for the Conservatives,” Ford said. Another point of interest is the political backdrop to a large and very expensive polling operation. It was, the Telegraph said, commissioned by the Conservative Britain Alliance, a previously unknown organisation described only as a “group of Conservative donors”. YouGov, the Telegraph added, worked with the Tory peer David Frost, who contributed an opinion piece arguing that the only way back from the brink for the party was to go much harder on immigration, seeking to tempt former Tory voters who are backing the Nigel Farage-founded Reform UK. “The big problem is immigration, legal as well as illegal. That’s why this week’s vote on Rwanda is so important,” Frost writes. The Telegraph runs its own analysis arguing that Reform votes would play a part in 96 losses for the Conservatives, making the difference between a catastrophic loss and a hung parliament. The combined message is clear: copy Reform, notably on small boats and on migration more generally. Others, however, disagree. “The Telegraph analysis works on the basis that all these seats would come back if every single Reform vote went back to the Conservatives – that’s a mighty big ‘if’,” Ford said. Even YouGov felt obliged to add a note to their in-house report on the polling to stress that the Telegraph analysis of Reform votes was “not a reliable way of measuring their impact”. Ford added: “Where I do agree with David Frost is that the government is in a lot of trouble. But it doesn’t seem rational to me to endlessly focus on an issue where, the polling says, the voters don’t trust you, and you risk alienating the One Nation MPs. “Tory MPs on the right think of the centrists a bit like Labour MPs think of the Lib Dems – they either pretend they don’t exist, or that if they do, they won’t do anything. And it’s true they are more squishy than the right of the party, but there are enough of them who are angry and can only be pushed so far.” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said that while the YouGov polling appeared solid, “the spin put on it by Frost and friends is something else altogether”. He said: “Exhibit A would be their central claim that if Reform weren’t in the picture, the Tories could prevent Labour from winning an overall majority – a claim that depends entirely on the batty assumption that every single voter who would otherwise vote for Reform would vote Tory instead. “Essentially, this is a laughably transparent attempt to scare Tory MPs into allowing the party, on the equally batty basis that immigration and woke are more important to voters than the economy and the NHS, to be pushed and pulled even further to the right – and the tragedy is that it might just work.”"

        "content": "Grant Shapps has said the UK will not accept the Red Sea being permanently closed to commercial shipping, as he left open the possibility that western forces might attack Houthi rebels in Yemen once more.\nThe defence secretary said on Monday the US-led airstrikes launched against the Houthis last week were designed to be a one-off military action designed to stop their attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea.\nBut he added that the US, UK and their international partners were watching carefully to see what the rebels do next as they assess whether further attacks are needed.\nSpeaking at Lancaster House in central London, Shapps said: “We will watch very carefully; we will look at the patterns of what’s happening; we will check the capability; we will in particular, be interested to see those links between Tehran and the Houthis to see whether when we’re monitoring, whether there are shipments; whether we detect intelligence and the rest of it.\nHe added: “Although this was a distinct piece of precisely targeted military action, we will not put up with a major waterway, major shipping lanes being closed on a permanent basis.”\nShapps was outlining his vision for the UK’s military forces after just over four months in the job, arguing Britain’s participation in last week’s strikes in Yemen was evidence of how unstable the world was now.\n\n Related: Who are the Houthis and how did the US and UK strikes on Yemen come about? \n\n“We’ve come full circle, moving from a postwar to prewar world,” he said. “An age of idealism is being replaced by a period of hard-headed realism.”\nHe added that in this more unstable world, the military would need more money. “Our great resource has always been men and women who work tirelessly to protect our nation,” he said. “But to defend our nation from increasing dangers of tomorrow they must have what they need to do the job.”\nSeveral Conservative MPs who watched the speech interpreted his words as a traditional pre-budget call for money made by successive defence secretaries before him. “The message was pretty clear,” said one. “He wants more from the Treasury.”\nShapps said in December he wanted to see the UK’s defence budget rise by as much as 50% to 3% of economic output, from just above 2% today.\nShapps will address MPs later on Monday as he defends the government’s decision to take military action against the Houthis without consulting parliament first.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nShapps told the BBC that briefing parliament before the strikes would not have been practical. He said: “One of the issues with having a sort of full debate about those things upfront is it would have provided perhaps too much information in detail to the Houthis.\n“So we needed to act. In fact, we did that with quite a lot of consultation – with parliament, with the speaker, the leader of the opposition, and others. And of course, there’ll be time today to have that public discussion in parliament as well.”\nWhile the Houthis have said their attacks on shipping are simply aimed at Israel following its war on Gaza in response to the 7 October massacres by Hamas, Shapps dismissed this idea.\n“I know the Houthis are saying that it’s somehow connected, but actually, 50 different nations have had their ships attacked, so it quite clearly isn’t actually connected,” he said.\nIn an apparent sign that the rebels intend to carry on attacking ships, the US military said on Sunday night that US fighter aircraft had shot down an anti-ship cruise missile fired from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen at one of its warships in the Red Sea.\nThe missile was fired towards the USS Laboon, which was operating in the southern Red Sea, US Central Command said in a statement, in what appears to be the first such attempt to strike a US destroyer. No injuries or damage were reported.\n• The second video in this article was amended on 19 January 2024 to remove footage of an explosion that was from a different incident, dating back to at least September 2023."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-15T07:00:08+00:00",
        "content": "A French woman has spoken about how she lost her job in Shropshire and was left “heartbroken” about life in the UK because of a mix-up over the immigration process for EU citizens launched after Brexit.  Sophie, who is married to a British man, was in the UK for five years before Brexit but went back to France in 2020 for 18 months after a family tragedy. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the rights of British citizens in Europe and EU citizens in the UK to live and work in their country of residence before Brexit are protected. When she eventually applied to the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) in early 2022, Sophie knew she had missed the June 2021 deadline but also knew from the government website that late applications were being considered if there were “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline. Her application in early 2022 was, however, refused on the grounds that she had “not evidenced clearly enough” that she “had continued to live with my husband when I was in France which was a little confusing”. On legal advice, she decided to launch a formal appeal through the asylum and immigration tribunal system, a route open to all EU citizens applying for the EUSS. She sensed something was awry when she did not receive a certificate of application, a document that confirms the right to work and live in the UK while applications are being considered for the EUSS. Nonetheless, through a “share code”, a digital identification number issued by the Home Office for applicants, she was able to evidence she had the right to work and got a job in a logistics firm near her home. “There was never really any problem. I was just waiting patiently for an answer. Using the share code my employer did the right-to-work check and it came back positive very quickly. “It was only valid for six months so they renewed it again in July and then just at the start of December 2023 they ran the right-to-work check again and it came back that I didn’t have the right to work.” With employers facing fines of £20,000 for employing illegal workers, Sophie received shock news. “They told me they had to let me go. They did say, ‘this is your job and it’s not going anywhere’, but in the meantime I was effectively dismissed,” she said. “I’ve not been able to earn any money since December and in the middle of a cost of living crisis it’s a little bit tough.  “I am heartbroken, to be honest. I’ve been in love with the UK since I was a little girl and this is why I came here. This situation seems dangerous but also foolish because I’m willing to work, to make a contribution to society. I want to work. I want to be autonomous, I don’t want to be claiming benefits. But they are not letting me.”  After inquiries were made to the Home Office last week by the Guardian, it emerged that Sophie may have made an application through the wrong route in the EUSS. She should have applied for the EU settlement scheme in its own right, not the family permit, as this was designed for relatives joining EU citizens in the UK from abroad. This may also explain why she was not issued a certificate of application. She is seeking legal advice, applying for the EU settlement scheme and hoping her late application will be approved. “Through the past two years at no point did I have a case worker, a point of contact, or any guidance on my rights. The whole system feels like it is set up for failure and to push people through the paid-for visa route,” she said. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “More than two years have passed since the main deadline for applying to the EU settlement scheme, which was widely publicised. In line with the citizens’ rights agreements, we continue to accept and consider late applications from those with reasonable grounds for their delay in applying.”"

        "content": "You might think the idea of pounding the streets and banging on doors during a cold January would not be too enticing, especially when the prize for the victor vanishes in a few months time. But Damien Egan, Labour’s candidate for the Kingswood byelection, was beaming as he marched up and down the streets of a modern housing estate at the heart of a constituency in South Gloucestershire up for grabs after the sudden resignation of its Conservative MP, Chris Skidmore. “It definitely wasn’t something I was expecting but I’m really excited about it,” Egan said. “I grew up in Kingswood. I really know the area. Once you’re on the streets, you get the feeling you have the chance to give a voice to those people you grew up with.” Skidmore, a leading Tory voice on green issues, resigned in protest againt his party’s dash for oil and gas, setting up a difficult byelection for Rishi Sunak. Over the last half century, Kingswood, has swung between the Tories and Labour. Skidmore won the seat in 2010 and had built up an 11,000 majority by 2019. The constituency is being abolished at the next general election, when Kingswood voters will find themselves in one of four different constituencies. Egan, who until last week was the mayor of Lewisham in south-east London, had previously been selected as the candidate for one of these, Bristol North East, a key Labour target. But when Skidmore stepped down, Egan resigned from his Lewisham job and headed to South Gloucestershire to fight for Kingswood. He is staying with his sister and looking for somewhere to rent, so is getting firsthand experience of a key election issue here – soaring house and rental prices. “There are a lot of people with kids living at home in their 20s. Getting on the housing ladder is hard,” he said. Egan has been struck by how rundown some things have become here. “People also talk a lot about how hard it is to get a GP or NHS dentist. Someone said it’s like the Victorian era, with people pulling out their own teeth.” Out campaigning with Egan was Kerry McCarthy, Labour MP for Bristol East and the shadow climate change minister, who got on well with Skidmore. “He’s gone for genuine reasons and it’s quite nice to have someone who hasn’t gone because of sleaze,” she said of the former Tory minister. McCarthy said people in the area, which has traditionally provided workers for big manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems and Airbus, were interested to talk about the transition to green jobs. “They get that net zero is the way to do it,” she added. The Kingswood byelection is also an important test for Labour’s hopes to challenge the Tories and the Liberal Democrats in south-west England. Luke Pollard, the Labour MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, said: “There are about 60 parliamentary seats in the south-west. We have six currently and our objective is to get to 17. That makes this region as important as any in the country. “Whether it’s seats in Cornwall or Bristol, the best way is to get on the doorsteps and have those conversations. There’s a lot of people who have left the Tories but haven’t necessarily arrived at their new destination.” There are clearly people in Kingswood looking for something new. ‘We definitely do need a change,” said Graham Bond, a delivery driver. A Scot, Bond said he would vote Scottish National party if he could. “But obviously they’re not standing. It’s between Labour and the Greens here for me.” His wife, Ruth Bruce, a businessperson, said: “All the Tories are interested in is what they get out of it, what directorships they are getting, what connections they are making.” Ken Comley, a retired tour operator, stopped Egan and asked him to sort out a local graveyard. “But I won’t be voting for him,” Comley said. “I’ll always vote Conservative because Mrs Thatcher gave us the chance to buy shares.” Aimie Green, who works in a florists on Hanham High Street in the constituency, said the byelection campaign was not the talk of the town. “I don’t think there’s that much interest,” she said. Mat Knight, who owns a cycling shop in the high street, said he thought Skidmore had jumped ship because his constituency was disappearing. “The Labour candidate has been here already – he talked well about the high street and green issues,” said Knight. The Green party came fourth in Kingswood in 2019 but since then has the largest group on Bristol city council. Its national co-leader Carla Denyer said Skidmore’s resignation was a damning verdict on the Tories but argued that Labour should be doing more to challenge the government’s oil and gas policies. “Kingswood is on the edge of Bristol, a city that is turning Green. We see increasing support for greens in surrounding areas as well,” she added. Meanwhile, Egan rejects the notion that the Kingswood campaign is a warm-up for his Bristol North East push, saying: “It’s not a practice run. The voters here need an MP.” He accepted the Tories had a big majority. “That’s why have to be out every day. We’ll be in our thermals speaking to as many people as possible.”"

        "content": "The latest drug to be in short supply in the UK is a treatment for epileptic seizures. A notification from the Department of Health and Social Care last Wednesday informed doctors and pharmacists that Tegretol – or carbamazepine – 200mg prolonged release tablets would not be available until mid-January. It was said to be of “medium impact”, as such supply shortages go. The use of low-risk therapeutic alternatives, unlicensed imports or alternative strengths or formulations were the ways to proceed. An inconvenience on this occasion but a week earlier practitioners had been informed that supply of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, used by those with type 2 diabetes, would be problematic throughout 2024, and that doctors should immediately stop prescribing it to those seeking to lose weight. This time there was also a national patient safety alert requiring “action to be taken by healthcare providers to reduce the risk of death or disability”. Days before that, there had been notification that a tablet used by cancer patients to treat high levels calcium of the blood would not be available until late March. There is also a shortage of a brand of tablets for the treatment of heart-related chest pain, heart failure and oesophageal spasms. Women experiencing menopause who use the Estring 7.5 micrograms estradiol vaginal ring need also to look elsewhere and there is a supply issue with a range of tablets used by people with angina.  Interactive  As of 18 December, the list of medicinal shortages in the UK included 96 products, according to the British Generic Manufacturers Association. Thats is down on the 111 such shortages at the end of October but there have been a further 10 supply notifications from DHSC since then. The total is close to double the 52 medicines for which there was an issue in January 2022. The trend over the last few years is clear. A 2023 pressures survey by Community Pharmacy England found that 92% of pharmacy teams were dealing with medicine supply issues daily, an increase from 67% the year before. They reported that 87% of pharmacy teams members believed patient health was being put at risk. It is not just a UK phenomenon. A recent European Association of Hospital Pharmacists survey reported that 95% of hospital pharmacists across Europe were experiencing shortages. An EU medicines shortage working party met last month to discuss a critical shortage of five key medicines, with impediments to supply said to include the impact of the war in Ukraine on supply chains, a European Medicines Agency recommendation to suspend use of about 400 medicines tested by an Indian laboratory, as well as attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the extra regulatory paperwork that arises in some chains of supply due to Brexit. All these affect the UK too. But industry insiders say there are problems peculiar to Britain. The plummeting value of the pound following the Brexit referendum has made it more expensive for the NHS to buy medicines. Then there is the voluntary scheme introduced by the government in 2019 in an attempt to ensure that NHS spending on branded medicines did not grow by more than 2% in a year. As of the end of 2023, there was a 26% levy on revenues of drug manufacturers earned beyond the cap. The companies claim it has made the UK an unattractive place to do business. It has, they say, acted as a drag on investment. From this year that cap will rise to allow a 4% annual rise in spending. The British Generic Manufacturers Association says the government is still penny pinching. Then there is a lack of joined up planning and communication. In 2015, guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) prompted a hike in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions but manufacturers proved unable to meet demand. There were still HRT shortages last year. In November 2022, pharmacists in the UK began reporting difficulties in procuring the antibiotic amoxicillin. At the same time Rishi Sunak was saying there was ample supply. A week later, a medicine shortage notification was issued, followed by an export ban. It is perhaps little wonder then that four in five pharmacy owners say they have experienced aggression from patients due to medicine supply issues. Patience with the system is also running out fast."

        "content": "When he was the House of Commons speaker, John Bercow developed a combative reputation – and after his tenure he was found to be a “serial bully” and a liar. But now as he makes his reality TV debut, the man with the famous cry of “order!” is seeking to use his political experience to unleash chaos. “I’m a retired politician,” Bercow said in the season premiere of the US version of The Traitors. “Backstabbing, deception are all part and parcel of the political life.” Bercow joins the Love Island winner Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Tamra Judge of The Real Housewives of Orange County, Maksim Chmerkovskiy of Dancing with the Stars and Marcus Jordan – son of the basketball legend Michael Jordan – as one of 21 celebrities competing at a castle in the Scottish Highlands for a cash prize – the same venue as the UK version, broadcast by BBC. Three of the contestants have been chosen by the host, Alan Cumming, to sow chaos and purposely sabotage the others. While Bercow was not selected as a traitor, several of his fellow contestants suspected he was after he experienced “breathing difficulties” during the premiere. He blamed the difficulties on asthma, but others doubted his answer. “When you took your mask off, you said: ‘I have asthma’ but you just said: ‘I was asthmatic as a child,’” said Big Brother’s Janelle Pierzina. She questioned what exactly Bercow told another contestant about his breathing issues, to which he replied: “Look, is asthma a lifelong condition?” “That’s not the question I’m asking you,” Pierzina said. “You’re answering this just like a politician.” In this season, Big Brother’s Dan Gheesling, Phaedra Parks from The Real Housewives of Atlanta and Survivor’s Parvati Shallow are the traitors, but at the end of the first episode Peppermint of Ru Paul’s Drag Race was voted off. A number of the other contestants voted for Bercow, however. Bercow served as Commons speaker for 10 years, with clips of his snarky retorts and cries for “order, order” while arbitrating Brexit debates and PMQs gaining the politician a cult following in the US and across Europe. “No one on the British island can call ‘order, order’ more beautifully than John Bercow,” the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant stated in its 2019 profile of the speaker. He quit his Commons role in 2019. An independent inquiry in 2022 found that Bercow was a “serial bully” and a liar and that he should be banned from holding a parliamentary pass. The former speaker was accused of throwing a mobile phone and swearing at officials, with the inquiry upholding 21 out of 35 complaints filed against him by former staff. Before the final report was published, Bercow criticised the way the inquiry was conducted, saying: “To call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos.”"

        "content": "Keir Starmer has rejected claims he has watered down promises to introduce a law giving MPs a vote before military intervention and to stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. During his party’s 2020 leadership race, the Labour leader promised to introduce a “prevention of military intervention act” that would stop “more illegal wars” and ensure military action could only be taken if a lawful case was made, the Commons had given its consent and there was “a viable objective”. Starmer has backed the RAF strikes in Yemen with the US, which were authorised by Rishi Sunak without giving parliamentarians a say, but he insisted on Sunday there was “no inconsistency” between the two positions. The Labour leader said he stood by the principle that military action should be put to parliament. “There is obviously a huge distinction between an operation, the like of which we have seen in the last few days, and military action, a sustained campaign, military action usually involving troops on the ground,” he said. Asked if his plan to give the Commons a say related only to sending in ground forces, he said: “Yes, because what I said when I made that pledge was that what I want to do was to codify the convention.” Starmer hinted the requirement for MPs to have a say may not need to be put in law. “I want to codify that – it could be by a law, it could be by some other means,” he said. “I’m not ruling out law.” Rejecting suggestions his move could anger the party’s leftwing, Starmer added: “No Labour activist has ever said to me ‘if urgent action is needed we should stop that in order for parliament to be convened’.” Before becoming Labour leader in 2020, Starmer said the UK “should stop the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia” over concerns about their use in Yemen’s civil war. He told the BBC he was still committed to reviewing all arms sales, but he refused to be definitive when it came to the Saudis. “We will review the situation and the review will give us the answers to those questions.” The Conservatives accused Starmer of not being able to say “what he’d do differently” as he “just snipes from the sidelines”. Rejecting wider claims that he frequently changes his mind and contradicts his values and ideas, Starmer said: “Labour party members are predominantly, overwhelmingly, behind what we’ve done with and to the party, to change the party. Four years ago, we were picking ourselves up, bruised, from a terrible election result … “We have ruthlessly changed the Labour party, put ourselves in a position where it can credibly contend in the election this year, and the overwhelming majority of Labour party members and supporters are delighted.” Starmer also defended taking a private jet paid for by Qatar to visit the country’s leader, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to discuss the hostage situation in Gaza, despite Labour criticising Sunak’s “private jet habit”. The Labour leader argued on Sunday there was a clear “distinction” between flying around England when trains could be used and using such trips to hold key talks with foreign leaders. According to parliamentary records, Starmer used the Qatari-provided jet to travel between the Cop28 climate conference and Doha, where he met the Emir of Qatar with three members of staff. The trip would have cost Qatar more than £25,000. “I think there’s a distinction, most people will understand, between flying in the circumstances I’ve just described and using private jets to jet around England when trains will get you there nearly as quickly,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg. “The long and the short of it was in Dubai I was having a number of discussions with international leaders about climate change as you would expect, but of course I was having a nearly equal number about the conflict in the Middle East – how do we have a sustainable path to that ceasefire?” Starmer was also questioned for accepting the free flight to Qatar when he said previously he would not watch England in the World Cup there because of concerns about the Gulf state’s human rights record."

When I commented on this to my colleague Jeff Chapman, a South Yorkshire councillor, he explained that the aim was to make it a free service for everyone. Margaret Thatcher’s government put paid to that, of course. Sheffield’s roads are now jammed with traffic at peak times, which, despite bus lanes, slows their progress. And, without concessions, fares are many times more expensive than in the early 1970s. But don’t underestimate the difficulty in getting people out of their cars and on to public transport. There was plenty of resistance 50 years ago from middle-class motorists in Sheffield, who objected to subsidising the buses through local tax income. It will be even harder now that cars are designed to cosset their occupants and isolate them from the outside world. On the other hand, today there is a greater recognition of the impact of motor traffic on climate, pollution and safety.  Also, travelling by public transport is generally more relaxing. It is, after all, a “hands-free” form of motoring, that doesn’t require sophisticated technology. John KirkwoodSheffield  • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "published_date": "2024-01-14T14:41:10+00:00",
        "content": "Luciana Berger has been given a key role in Labour’s mental health strategy, five years after she left the party over its handling of antisemitism cases. The former MP for Liverpool Wavertree has been appointed to lead a cross-government strategy focused on lowering suicide rates by appointing thousands of mental health professionals to support people who self-harm. Keir Starmer announced Berger’s new role at the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) conference, as he assured members he would “never let antisemitism sneak back into the Labour party undercover”. He told the conference: “I see no greater cause in my leadership than this. This is my role.” Berger said Labour had turned a significant corner under Starmer’s leadership and expressed her excitement about leading the initiative. “Millions of people are experiencing poor mental health, without the necessary support to recover,” she said. “The absence of a proper plan to address the causes of poor mental health requires urgent attention. “Labour’s commitment to deliver a cross-government long-term strategy to tackle mental ill-health is an important step towards gripping this issue, and I am really excited to be leading this work.” Berger served as a shadow health minister between 2013 and 2016. As a Labour MP, she spoke of suffering a torrent of antisemitic abuse online and in person, and relied on police protection at the party’s annual conference. One man who sent her antisemitic threats was jailed for two years in 2017. While eight months pregnant, Berger faced a no-confidence motion in her constituency over her criticism of Jeremy Corbyn. The motion was withdrawn after it emerged that a key opponent in the local party had called her a “disruptive Zionist”. She subsequently left Labour in 2019 to join the new political party Change UK amid dissatisfaction with Corbyn’s response to antisemitism in the party.  Berger stood for the Lib Dems in the 2019 general election but lost, and rejoined Labour in February 2023 after an apology from Starmer. Berger will present recommendations before the next election about how to achieve Labour’s plans to prevent mental ill-health. Describing how the party had “changed irrevocably” under his leadership, Starmer told the conference: “I know there are many members of this community who still need to see more from us, and the work goes on. “But I am proud of the steps we have taken so far, proud of the journey that JLM has led the party on.” As part of Labour’s plans to improve child health, Starmer has vowed to introduce mental health support in every school, community mental health hubs aimed at under-25s and recruit 8,500 new mental-health professionals. The Labour leader has also pledged to provide specialist self-harm training to the 8,500 additional mental health staff he committed to recruiting if his party wins the general election this year. The overall policy would cost £440m, the party has said, and would be paid for by scrapping a private equity loophole it believes would raise as much as £600m. The government has insisted it is taking action to reduce “the number of tragic suicides”, with an extra £2.3bn a year going into mental health services to help a further 2 million people, as well as £150m invested in crisis services. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "published_date": "2024-01-14T12:26:17+00:00",
        "content": "Allan Rogers, the former Labour MP for Rhondda who has died aged 91, had, through the circumstances of his childhood, a passionate understanding of the difficult lives of many of his constituents in the valleys of south Wales. The youngest of 12 children of a disabled former miner who was unable to find work for over a decade after he was injured in a colliery accident, Rogers sought ways to improve the prospects for those he represented throughout his life – first as a councillor in local government, then as a member of the European parliament for five years and subsequently, from 1983 until 2001, in the House of Commons. There, Rogers made an impact as a lively, enterprising and assertive MP. He was genial and popular on the Labour benches, but he was too much of a straight-talking class warrior for many in other parties. He pursued those responsible for financial mismanagement and fraud, and once complained bitterly to the public accounts committee (PAC): “Steal £20 from the DHSS and you land up in jail; steal £20m in the City and you land up in the Cayman Islands.” He was a doughty fighter for his constituency but was opposed to devolution to Wales, arguing instead for more direct government investment – particularly in the valleys as the coal industry was closed. He condemned the Conservative government’s “Valleys Initiative” for regeneration in 1989 as amounting to little more than “a few brass lamps outside Rhondda’s pubs”. As well as the PAC (1986-88), Rogers was a member of the European scrutiny committee (2000) and the Welsh affairs committee (1986-87). Neil Kinnock, as Labour leader, appointed him a junior defence spokesman in 1987 and in 1992, under the leadership of John Smith, he joined the foreign affairs team. That year, he stood unsuccessfully against Doug Hoyle for the chairmanship of the parliamentary Labour party. In 1994 Tony Blair dropped him from the frontbench and he was made a member of the influential intelligence and security committee. Three years prior, Rogers had notably blown the whistle on British companies exporting arms to Iraq, when he called for an inquiry into the issue, claiming it contravened the UN resolution on the subject. This would lead to the damning Scott report. He was never in sympathy with Blair’s New Labour project, although he voted for Blair and John Prescott as leader and deputy. He announced in 1998, a year after Labour’s triumphant election win, that he would retire at the next general election, citing his disenchantment with government policy on education, health and welfare reform. “Working-class people feel that the government has forgotten them in its desire to become the friend of big business, the City and media moguls,” he told the Daily Mirror. Born in Gelligaer in the Rhymney Valley, the son of Madeleine (nee Smith) and John Rogers – who had been injured in 1926 and did not work again until the second world war brought other employment to south Wales – Allan had become a member of the Labour party at 16. He was a clever boy and won a scholarship from his secondary school in Bargoed to Selwyn College, Cambridge, but was unable to take it up because administrative errors had led to the loss of his application to defer his national service. Instead he spent two years with the Royal Welch Fusiliers and in 1953 studied for a degree in geology at University College, Swansea. He worked as a geologist in the UK, Canada, the United States and Australia from 1956 until 1963, when he took up teaching. He recognised the crucial importance of education as a route to self-improvement and spent the next 15 years working as a schoolteacher and in adult education. As a tutor with the Workers’ Educational Association for five years, he was a colleague of Kinnock, then in 1970 he became the WEA district secretary for mid and south Wales. He was elected to Gelligaer district council, where he served between 1965 and 1971, and in 1970 to Glamorgan (later Mid Glamorgan) county council. Although an anti-marketeer – in common with many on the Labour left at the time – Rogers stood in the first round of direct elections to the European parliament in 1979 and became the MEP for South East Wales. He won a reputation as an effective member, securing substantial European funding for his constituency but sought unsuccessfully to establish a register of MEPs’ financial interests. He was a vice-president of the parliament, from 1979 until 1982, but membership did not change his views on European politics and he continued to advocate British withdrawal. He was already looking to further his career at Westminster. He failed to secure selection as the Labour candidate for Caerphilly in 1982, but the following year was chosen for Rhondda to succeed the shadow Welsh secretary, Alec Jones, whose death that March would have precipitated a byelection had the general election not been called for early June. A visiting professor at the University of South Wales from 1997, Rogers continued to work in education after leaving politics as chair of the Earth Science Education Forum from 2002 to 2010. He was a board member of the British Geological Survey from 2001 to 2005 and a fellow of the Geological Society, as well as a member of the Treorchy Workingmen’s Club and president of Penallta rugby football club. He loved all sport and had been a boxer in his youth. A jazz enthusiast and a keen gardener, he was at different times a dog breeder and owned a chip shop, managed by a family member. In 1955, he married his sweetheart from schooldays, Ceridwen James. She died in 2022. He is survived by their children, Cerilan, Richard, Alison and Catherine.  • Allan Ralph Rogers, politician, born 24 October 1932; died 28 November 2023"

        "content": "“We can’t keep banging our heads against the wall,” said James Dolan, the billionaire owner of New York’s Madison Square Garden arena, who last week abandoned a five-year effort to build a glowing orb concert venue taller than St Paul’s Cathedral in London. The Trump donor, who also owns the New York Knicks basketball team and built his first Sphere venue in Las Vegas, had foundered on the craggy rocks of the UK’s planning system – the same one that took more than eight years to approve a fifth terminal for Heathrow airport and fails to build enough affordable housing but allows forests of speculative skyscrapers to stand partly empty. In barbed statements announcing it was taking its Sphere elsewhere (possibly Abu Dhabi), Dolan’s company said it would instead seek “forward-thinking cities” and accused the authorities of treating its proposal as “a political football”. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, had started out welcoming the “world-class venue” only to turn against it as having “an unacceptable negative impact on local residents”. The scheme was strongly opposed, not just by local residents, but also the rival AEG group, which runs a large concert venue inside the nearby O2 arena in Greenwich. But whatever the view of its merits, the episode adds weight to an increasingly urgent question: has planning in the UK lost its way? “The British planning system is probably at the weakest it’s been since it’s creation,” Peter Rees, who for 29 years was the chief planner for the corporation of London, said. “It has been emasculated by various politicians from Gordon Brown onwards.” Rees is one of the most respected planners in Britain today. From 1985 to 2014 he oversaw the Square Mile’s transformation from staid ancient banking quarter into today’s gleaming global financial hub. He oversaw the erection of 21st-century landmark towers such as the Gherkin, the Cheesegrater and the Scalpel. Planning has become highly politicised, he said, with power shifting too far from expert officials to non-expert councillors and government ministers, with the result that “it is very much a casino”. Rees contrasted it to the “can-do” attitude of professional planning that delivered new towns in the 1960s and 1970s, a timely reference as Labour is pledging to build new towns if it wins the coming general election. “Since then it’s become over-political,” said Rees, now professor of places and city planning at University College London. “The consequence is that it is almost impossible to know in advance which way a planning application will go.” Successive governments have seen planning as a lever to deliver economic growth, and weakened rules in an effort to “get the planning system out of the way”, he said. “If you are going to have a planning system based on rules, a planning application should pass or fail,” he said. “What we don’t want is debate in political forums.” When Dolan proposed the Sphere, the culture secretary at the time, Matt Hancock, was effusive in his support, saying it “cements both the capital and UK’s reputation for leading the world in music and the creative industries”. But with Hancock gone and Khan changing his mind after closer scrutiny, the scheme was dead. So developers who used to focus on building relationships with professional planners to get their schemes approved increasingly target non-expert elected politicians who are the ultimate arbiters, industry sources say. “If you go to New York there’s a clear set of rules so everyone knows where they are,” said Peter Stewart, a former government design adviser and now a consultant to developers seeking planning approvals. “[In the UK] planning policy guidance, national, local and in London says things that when unpicked and scrutinised turn out to be air. Everything is negotiable. When foreign investors come forward and say can we do something or can’t we, you have to say: ‘It depends’.” In other words, it is a gamble. There has been a change in architectural fashions too, which Dolan perhaps did not grasp. “In big commercial development there’s less appetite for jazziness and there’s a trend for sobriety,” Stewart said. The winners of the annual Stirling prize for Britain’s best building are more often calm studies in brick and block than the shiny architectural gymnastics of earlier years when clients and planners were hungry for “iconic” architecture. And the climate emergency has become a big issue in planning departments, which are increasingly concerned about the carbon embodied in new proposals – hence Marks & Spencer was last year refused permission to rebuild from scratch its store on Oxford Street. City leaders outside the capital have strived to create greater certainty for investors. In Manchester, for example, a wave of development that started with the reconstruction after the 1996 IRA bombing continues. This year Co-op Live, the UK’s largest indoor arena with 23,500 seats, will open next to Manchester City’s football stadium and a 76-storey residential tower was recently proposed – the tallest yet in the city. But in Bristol, plans for a new arena, first mooted two decades ago, have not reached fruition, and last year one in five architects told a survey by the Royal Institute of British Architects that projects had recently been abandoned because of planning delays up from 7% in 2021. London’s planning policy straddles the approach taken in New York where massive dramatic buildings are allowed, albeit to strict codes, and cities such as Paris and Berlin where planning is highly conservative to maintain the historic urban cores, said Stewart. The development of the City of London is a case in point. In the past 20 years, ever taller and bulkier skyscrapers have risen up in the east of the financial district and 11 more are planned by 2030. The tallest of these, 1 Undershaft designed by Eric Parry, will rise to 75 storeys – almost as high as the Shard, the UK’s tallest building. But in the area closer to Sir Christopher Wren’s 17th-century St Paul’s Cathedral, buildings must not disrupt historic views and have to stay low. In planning, as in so much else, Britain wants it both ways. Meanwhile, the casino element of the planning system encourages developers to gamble. It means “we are faced with these crazy applications – the Tulip, the Sphere – these things are turning London into a fairground,” said Rees. The Tulip, a bud-shaped viewing tower more than twice the height of the London Eye proposed by the company of a Brazilian billionaire, was rejected in 2021 by the current secretary of state with responsibility for planning, Michael Gove, because it was a waste of resources and he questioned “the quality of design”. One resident complainant said it “reeks of desperation in its straining after ostentatious effect”. Another said it “would fit better into Dubai than London”. But while that was rejected, a few miles away the development of thousands of mostly expensive apartments around Battersea power station have been described as “Dubai-on-Thames”. There is a lack of consistency. In British planning, as Stewart puts it, “everything is up for grabs”."

        "content": "The “lights are absolutely flashing red” on the global dashboard, the UK foreign secretary has said, insisting airstrikes against Houthi sites in Yemen were necessary to prevent future attacks by the group.\nDavid Cameron said it was “hard to think of a time when there has been so much danger and insecurity and instability in the world”.\nPraising the prime minister’s judgment on the military action, he said Rishi Sunak had “followed all the correct procedures” before the strikes, including assembling ministers, listening to advice, and consulting allies.\nAsked on Sky News whether ministers had considered that the strikes could raise the likelihood of terrorist action in the UK, Cameron said: “The threat level is set after careful consideration by the joint terrorist assessment centre and that is the right way of doing it; it is not in the power of politicians just to suddenly wake up one morning and change the threat level.\n“Our view is, look, take a step back from this, it is hard to think of a time when there has been so much danger and insecurity and instability in the world.\n“The lights are absolutely flashing red, as it were, on the global dashboard and what we need at that time is strong leadership and a clear plan. That is what we have with the prime minister and the team in place.\n\n Related: Red Sea crisis could shatter hopes of global economic recovery \n\n“And taking action, if you don’t act against the Houthis in the Red Sea, you are going to see more attacks, they are effectively terroristic attacks, you will see more of that.”\nOn Monday, Sunak will make a statement to parliament addressing the strikes. The foreign secretary said it would not have been right to have held a debate and vote before the UK-US military strikes because of “operational security”.\nCameron was speaking on the 100th day since Hamas attacked Israel, sparking the country’s bombing of Gaza. He denied that the Red Sea conflict was linked to the Israel-Gaza war.\nWhen asked about the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, criticising the “disproportionate” UK-US strikes in Yemen, Cameron said: “We don’t agree with what President Erdoğan has said. If you look at the action we have taken, it is actually backed by a very wide coalition of countries.”\nHe added: “He is an important Nato ally, but in this case we don’t agree. We see this as completely separate from the Israel-Gaza conflict.”\nRejecting suggestions that the strikes had escalated the situation in the Red Sea, the foreign secretary told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “The escalation has been caused by the Houthis. I mean the point is, since 19 November you have had these 26 attacks.\n“There have been more of them; they have been getting worse and, you know, not acting is also a policy; it is a policy that doesn’t work.”\nWhile facing questions from a committee of MPs on Tuesday last week, Cameron suggested he was “worried” that Israel might have broken international law with its bombing of Gaza. Asked on Sunday about his comments, Cameron said: “I didn’t say that.”\nAsked whether he thought Israel had a case to answer in the international court of justice, where South Africa is accusing it of genocide, Cameron said: “No, I absolutely don’t. I think the South African action is wrong; I think it is unhelpful; I think it shouldn’t be happening.”\n\n Related: How Houthi anger with Israel is reshaping the Middle East conflict  \n\nThe former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove said the UK was “absolutely” right to launch strikes on the Houthis, but acknowledged there was a risk the action on the Houthis could inspire “lone wolf” terror attacks in the UK.\nAsked whether people in the UK should be feeling safer, Dearlove told Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: “If you’re talking about the sympathetic radicalism and the events in the Middle East now motivating, let’s say, domestic terrorism, well, there’s a risk there.\n“If you’re looking at the Houthis specifically, do they have an infrastructure in the UK which could be a sort of conspiratorial organisation to mount a terrorist attack? Unlikely. Very unlikely in my view.”\nSpeaking to the BBC, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there was “no inconsistency” between his support for strikes on the Houthis, and his previous calls for parliamentary oversight of military action.\nStarmer had said he would ensure military intervention was subject to approval by parliament, and considered passing an act of law to bind the government to this. Asked whether he had changed his position, he said: “No, there is no inconsistency here.\n“There is obviously a huge distinction between an operation, the like of which we have seen in the last few days, and military action, a sustained campaign, military action usually involving troops on the ground.”"

        "content": "Satnavs and Google Maps will soon include live data on road closures, parking restrictions and temporary speed limits in England under a UK government scheme aimed to ease drivers’ pain and pave the way for driverless cars. Councils will be ordered to digitise all traffic regulation orders (TROs), short-term traffic measures such as temporary speed limits or road closures. Many TROs are kept on paper and not updated automatically on digital systems, meaning they are sometimes missing from satnav systems. On Monday, the roads minister, Guy Opperman, will announce that the data will be uploaded to a central database and made freely available online for satnavs and mapping services. It will also include the location of parking spaces. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said digitising TROs would “also be crucial for ensuring autonomous vehicles can rely on accurate and up-to-date information so that they can operate safely once they start driving on British roads”. The move is part of the government’s plan for drivers, which purports to use £8.3bn of funding originally earmarked for HS2. Last year, Rishi Sunak cancelled the northern leg of the high-speed rail line from Birmingham to Manchester. Sunak’s administration has sought to present itself as being “on the side of motorists” – a marked contrast from Boris Johnson’s government, which was enthusiastically pro walking and cycling. Ministers decided to prioritise driving over active travel because of worries among ministers about “15-minute cities”, documents seen by the Guardian show. Opperman said: “This government is on the side of drivers, which is why we’re making travelling by road much easier. Everyone knows the frustrations of being sent down a closed road by your satnav, so by going digital with our traffic information we’re making sure that drivers have the very latest travel information to rely on.” There are 50 million people with a driving licence in Britain, driving about 40m licensed vehicle. Cars are the most popular mode of personal travel, comprising 58% of trips in 2022 and 78% of distance travelled. The DfT said the database should be up and running by 2025."

        "content": "Three months ago, our cameras captured Keir Starmer standing backstage at the ACC conference centre in Liverpool. The Labour leader, dressed in a smart dark suit and holding a cup of water, paced back and forth, a slight nervousness etched into his face. He was waiting to deliver perhaps the most important speech of his political career. For Labour advisers, this was his big chance to answer a key question that they believed would dominate all the way up to the 2024 general election: “If not them [the Conservatives], why us [Labour]?” You may remember what happened next. Within minutes, Starmer’s speech was interrupted by a protester who somehow stormed on to the stage, threw glitter across his back and grabbed hold of his arm. If it wasn’t for the flick of genuine fear on Starmer’s face, a cynical journalist might have wondered had this moment been stage-managed? I joked to that effect in the moments after the speech when I caught up with the Labour leader, leaving with his wife to walk back to their hotel room. “No,” he exclaimed, wagging his finger in my direction. But he was laughing, as he admitted this was the image he wanted to portray. “If ever there was a symbol that the Labour party has changed from protest to power,” he said. When ITV’s Tonight programme was given exclusive up-close access to the Labour leader, this was one of many clues I got as to what drives Starmer politically. Over three months, I followed him from the highs of his party conference to the lows of division and resignations over Israel and Gaza. To understand his political journey, I went back to his old university in Leeds, asked about tax and immigration in a target constituency, pressed him on climate policies at the UN conference in Dubai, listened to his fears for his family – and, of course, chatted about his football obsession on the way to his beloved Arsenal.   Related: Keir Starmer won’t just be battling the Tories this year but also the absence of hope | Andrew Rawnsley   So, politically speaking, who is the man tipped to be our next prime minister? Is he the idealistic lefty who wrote about the “authoritarian onslaught of Thatcherism” as a student in the 1980s? Is he the 2020 Labour party leadership hopeful who made 10 pledges, including mass nationalisations? Or is he the centrist who (after that moment of fear) almost revelled in the imagery of a protester being booted off stage at the final party conference before a general election year? Perhaps the best understanding came during a conversation in King’s Academy Prospect, a secondary school in Reading. We spoke in a design and technology lab in a wing of impressive buildings funded in the New Labour years. It was a late visit squeezed into Starmer’s brutal schedule. There, he blamed a dire economic backdrop for his decision not to lift the two-child cap on benefits. Pointing out that the previous Labour government invested heavily in public services, I asked him if he was sad that he couldn’t be as bold as Tony Blair. “Well, of course, but we’re inheriting a terrible situation,” he replied. And Starmer has clearly been advised that he shouldn’t offer the Tories even an inch on unfunded public spending. His mantra is that economic growth will turn the situation around, and he claims that his shadow cabinet is drumming up business investment now, to land on day one if it is elected.   My student self would also know the most important thing is to have a Labour government, otherwise it’s shouting into the void   For many, growth is a longer-term solution, so what about other more immediate choices, such as taxing people’s wealth? I turned back to Blair, reading this quote: “It’s not a burning ambition for me to make sure that David Beckham earns less money.” Did he disagree with that? “No,” Starmer responded without hesitation about Beckham or a similarly rich footballer today. “I don’t disagree with that.” But if you are prime minister, I went on, would you want to take more money from the super-rich (non-doms aside) and redistribute it to the poorest? Again, a “no”, without hesitation. “That isn’t how I want to grow the economy.” Starmer argued that while, of course, Labour believes in redistribution: “I don’t think redistribution is the sort of one-word answer for millions of people across the country”. He spoke of the dignity and respect of skilled work. “So I’m afraid if it’s just redistribution, I think that fundamentally disrespects people.” If I was to judge the Starmer I was listening to against two of the other contributors to our programme – Peter Mandelson, an architect of the 1997 Labour victory, and union leader Mick Lynch – it was clear which way he was leaning. This Labour leader was far more Mandy than Mick (though his advisers would argue he is neither). Lord Mandelson, a key figure in Blair’s 1997 victory, praised Starmer for bringing the party back from “a near-death experience” under Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, Lynch told us: “The Labour party has got to be a socialist organisation. We have got to take money off the rich and redistribute it to the rest of the communities in Britain. He’s got to identify with what working people need, not … with what the Daily Mail, the Telegraph and the Express are telling him to believe.” I wondered what had driven Starmer in the 80s. Back then, he was involved in producing a radical Trotskyist magazine called Socialist Alternatives. In one article, he argued that collective bargaining was not leftwing enough, handing too much power to the employers. And he did not hold back on the harm caused by Margaret Thatcher in the 80s. So why did he praise the former Conservative prime minister in a recent Sunday Telegraph article? Starmer asked if anyone would agree with exactly what they had believed at the age of 22. But, actually, he said he did agree that she delivered an “authoritarian onslaught”. “I would say the same now. What she had was a clarity of mission and a purpose – but actually what she did was very destructive.” Was he a lefty then? Is he now? Starmer hesitated briefly, aware of the growing gravity attached to his comments as the election draws near. But still “yes and yes”, he said. Still, something big has clearly shifted. I asked if defeat in the Hartlepool byelection in 2021 – a sobering moment, by all accounts – had led him to compromise those lefty principles to make way for a relentless pursuit of power? “When the electorate reject you as badly as they did in 2019, you don’t look at the electorate and say: ‘What are you thinking?’ You look at yourself and change the party.” And this was the theme Starmer kept coming back to: the hopelessness of opposition.  He took every chance to stress how he had changed the party, moving Labour towards the centre ground (although some in the party would argue passionately that this is moving to where voters are, and they are in a different place in 2024 compared with 1997) and embracing the idea that he had been “ruthless” in doing so. He said it again as we walked up to the Arsenal and talked about how politics compares to football. “It’s all about winning. You know some people say: ‘It’s the taking part that counts’. I don’t.” Surely you don’t say that to your children, I suggested. But he doubled down: “I don’t subscribe to any of that,” he said. But what might a young Starmer, who was clearly driven by a desire to tackle injustice and inequality, say to his older self, who won’t commit to lifting a two-child benefit cap or taxing the super-rich more than he has said so far? “The Keir Starmer of my student days would also know that the most important thing is to have a Labour government, otherwise it’s shouting into the void.” But he did concede that an idealistic young Starmer would probably want him to go further – especially if he wins.  • Tonight: Keir Starmer – Up Close will air on ITV1 at 8.30pm on 18 January"

        "content": "The prime minister has said the UK acted in “self-defence” with military strikes in Yemen intended to “de-escalate tensions and restore stability to the region”, as he faced calls for greater parliamentary scrutiny. Speaking from Ukraine, Rishi Sunak said that in the face of this aggression “we will always stand up for the rule of law” after a series of attacks by Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea. However, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National party and the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have urged the prime minister to recall parliament to seek approval for the military assault, while warning about the risk of escalation in the Middle East. Labour called for the legal advice in relation to the strikes to be published.   Related: The Guardian view on strikes on the Houthis: action to contain this crisis might fuel it | Editorial   Sunak said he would make a statement to MPs on Monday about “limited and necessary” military strikes in Yemen. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, briefed MPs on a call on Friday but did not take any questions. A senior Conservative, David Davis, said it appeared to be “reasonable” self-defence but that if the UK government intended to widen and intensify the military action in an aggressive way, then the prime minister ought to seek parliamentary approval with a vote of MPs. “In the event that they want to do a Libya- or Syria-type thing, that has to be preceded by a proper debate and authorisation by the House of Commons. There is of course a risk of escalation. If they up the ante and you have to hit what they’re upping the ante with, that’s still defensive,” Davis said. “But if, on the other hand, they want to take major action, let’s say to choke off Iranian supply lines, because we know that’s Iranian, that’s parliament first. This has changed in modern times … It is not that you don’t do it because of the threat of escalation. The test is whether it’s aggressive action.” The military action was backed across the Conservative party and by the Labour frontbench, with Keir Starmer saying his party was “fully supportive” of the action. Asked how concerned he was that MPs would not have the opportunity to debate the strikes until Monday, Starmer told broadcasters on a visit in Bury in Greater Manchester: “I want the prime minister to make a statement as soon as possible, but the principle of taking action against the Houthi rebels is really important.” Malcolm Rifkind, a Conservative former foreign secretary, now chair of the Audere Group, said there had been a risk that without any defensive action the Houthis would have accelerated their attacks. “They’ve chosen a whole pattern of behaviour which has been attacking, as it were, noncombatant ships – they haven’t been attacking Israeli targets. They’ve been attacking normal commercial shipping, going about its normal business. And they’ve done so with significant damage,” Rifkind said. “If action was not being taken there is no reason why the Houthis would not have continued doing this, and indeed accelerated and increased it in a significant way.” Alistair Burt, another Conservative former Foreign Office minister, said: “I don’t think we have moved into a convention where every military action needs the prior approval of parliament. I think we have got a convention where, if you’re going to commit significant numbers of ground troops, then that is likely to need parliamentary sanction. But it has always been the case that the government has been able to take executive action to deal with an imminent threat and then be accountable to parliament afterwards, and I think that’s entirely proper.” Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, had said MPs should be updated “at the earliest possible opportunity” and that he would recall parliament at the weekend if needed, but the prime minister said this was not required.   Related: Who are the Houthis and how did the US and UK strikes on Yemen come about?   In a TV clip recorded in Kyiv before talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Sunak said inaction over the attacks on ships by Houthi rebels, including a barrage seemingly aimed at western warships, risked destabilising the global economy. “Over the last month, we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea that’s putting innocent lives at risk,” Sunak said. “It’s disrupting the global economy, and it’s also destabilising the region. And in that time we’ve also seen the single biggest attack on a British navy warship that we’ve seen in decades.” Sunak described the US-led strike as “limited and necessary action in response to a specific threat in self-defence”, which was intended to “degrade and disrupt Houthi capability”. Asked what would happen if the strikes did not curb Houthi attacks on shipping, Sunak replied: “Initial indications are that those strikes have been successful. We’ll continue to monitor the situation. But it’s clear that this type of behaviour can’t be met without a response.” The Commons ended its business for the week on Thursday and is not due to reconvene before Monday afternoon. MPs can be recalled to sit over weekends if there is an urgent matter to consider. So far the Lib Dems and the SNP have called for MPs to sit over the weekend. Speaking in Kyiv, Sunak said an early recall was not needed. “If you look at similar situations in 2015 and 2018, a statement was made to parliament after the action and that’s what I will be doing on Monday – I’ll be making a full statement in parliament and taking questions.” Layla Moran, the Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said there was a need for MPs to have a say. “Parliament should not be bypassed,” she said. “Rishi Sunak must announce a retrospective vote in the House of Commons on these strikes and recall parliament this weekend. “We remain very concerned about the Houthis’ attacks. But that makes it all the more important to ensure that MPs are not silenced on the important issue of military action.” The strikes on Thursday night were the first to be launched against Houthi forces since they started targeting shipping in the Red Sea, a key international trade route. The Ministry of Defence said four Royal Air Force jets struck two Houthi facilities that were involved in the targeting of HMS Diamond and US navy vessels on Tuesday. One was a site in Bani, in the country’s north-west, and the other was the Abs airfield, near the west coast. The US air force said it struck more than 60 targets at 16 sites in Yemen. The UK and US had non-operational support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands."

        "content": "Returning from an overseas trip last year that had been broadly seen as a success, Rishi Sunak was heard privately observing that a truism of foreign policy is that even when you get things right, voters tend to not especially notice or care. Time will tell whether Sunak’s decision to throw in the UK’s lot with US-led attacks on Houthi forces will stem a spate of attacks on international shipping. But for now, the strike has won support from the bulk of British MPs, despite a few qualms about a lack of prior parliamentary consultation.   Related: Rishi Sunak pledges £2.5bn in military aid to Ukraine during Kyiv visit   Almost immediately after chairing the cabinet call which rubber-stamped the mission on Thursday evening, Sunak departed on an even less controversial foreign policy mission, heading to Kyiv to promise more UK military aid for Ukraine. Does all this have much meaning for the trajectory of UK politics in an election year? In one sense not especially, not least because it seems fairly clear that had Keir Starmer been the occupant of No 10, policy towards the Houthis and Ukraine would be almost identical. But when you are a prime minister staring balefully at a 20-point deficit in the polls, even the traditionally more bipartisan arena of foreign policy will inevitably be viewed through the prism of political manoeuvrings. And this is where the incumbent PM has an advantage. One of the other cliches of overseas policy is that even if surveys routinely show it ranks low on the lists of issues voters cite as a priority, it rarely does a prime minister harm to be photographed alongside other leaders, especially charismatic and popular ones like Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Boris Johnson was a famously keen supporter of the Ukrainian cause and a habitual visitor to Kyiv, and Sunak will have enjoyed the optics of Zelenskiy awarding him Ukraine’s Order of Liberty, however sheepish he looked as he was handed the medal inside a vast presentation case. “There is definitely something in the claim that standing next to famous international figures reinforces the sense of a person’s seriousness, particularly if they are someone lacking in seriousness,” said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “It’s also one of the very few of areas where Sunak has a united party. There are vanishingly few issues now where all his MPs will say ‘Well done’, and this is one of them.” The political downside for the prime minister is that when it comes to Yemen and Ukraine, such unanimity extends to most Labour MPs, and particularly to Starmer. One potential avenue for highlighting difference with Labour is the fact that the Houthi rebels began their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea after Israel’s invasion of Gaza in response to the 7 October massacre by Hamas, an issue Starmer’s party has seen frontbench resignations regarding his refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire. Similarly, a controversial bill banning local councils from boycotting Israel, voted on by MPs this week, is viewed by many as an attempt to create a wedge with Labour, and has faced criticism from some Conservative MPs. Menon also notes that a genuine political imperative for Sunak is trying to quell the attacks on vessels in the Red Sea – the impact on commercial shipping, with many container ships now being re-routed around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, has a knock-on effect on not just journey times but also cost. “As well as being an administration that is pretty happy to stick closely to the Americans, this is an administration that is obsessed with the cost of living and the dangers of inflation returning,” Menon said. “Voters’ awareness of foreign policy might be limited, but with Covid, and the war in Ukraine, and to an extent with Brexit, the idea that stuff that happens outside our borders has a material impact on us in our lives is, I think, now fairly standard. “Certainly, your average voter is probably more likely to know what a supply chain is now than would have been the case five years ago.”"

        "content": "Labour plans to scrap non-dom tax breaks would raise about a billion pounds less than the £3.2bn previously claimed, under an option being considered to allow a four-year grace period for those with the status. Research suggesting that scrapping the breaks could raise £3.2bn a year was cited by Labour when it announced the plans in 2022 to scrap rules allowing some wealthy people to avoid tax on foreign earnings if they have lived in the UK for less than 14 years. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said abolishing the tax break in full would raise that amount each year and that Labour would use the money to expand the NHS workforce. However, the party is also considering new regimes for temporary residents. One option under consideration is for individuals to be be able live as non-domiciles in the UK for four years before they pay the full UK tax, it is now understood.   Related: What is non-domicile status and who qualifies?   “We’ve actually been fairly conservative, with a small c, in terms of how much we think it will raise,” Wes Streeting told LBC on Thursday in relation to the overall policy. “We put the number [at] about £2bn; £1.6bn will go to the NHS, the rest will go to primary school breakfast clubs,” the shadow health secretary said. A Labour spokesperson said on Friday: “We have always been clear that we will scrap the non-dom rules, bringing in a modern scheme for people who are genuinely living in the UK for short periods.” But the party came under attack both from the Conservatives and from activists on its left over the potentially revised policy. “Full abolition of the non-dom tax status is a common sense, popular policy,” said Hilary Schan, the co-chair of Momentum, the leftwing campaign group. “So it beggars belief that the Labour leadership is watering down an already weak commitment on non-doms, and sacrificing much-needed funds for Britain’s broken public services in the process.” A Conservative spokesperson said: “Labour’s dodgy economics have been caught short again. With a £28bn spending spree and more unfunded policies lined up, it’s clear a Labour government would mean nothing but higher taxes. They cannot be trusted with the public’s money.” The policy to scrap the break – which has been used by Rishi Sunak’s wife to save paying millions in UK tax – is one of the main planks of Labour’s platform for how it proposes to fund planned service improvements. Reacting this week to the latest NHS waiting list figures, Streeting reiterated that a Labour government would provide 2m more operations and appointments a year to cut waiting lists, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status. Pledging in April 2022 to abolish the break, Reeves said Labour was sending a clear message to the global super-rich: “If you make your home in Britain you should pay tax here – on all of your income.”"

        "content": "  4.58pm GMT  Summary  Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day:  The Post Office’s leadership has been accused of showing contempt for victims after its lawyers told the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal that it was not reasonable to expect them to leave no stone unturned in getting to the truth. Chris Jackson, the lawyer acting for the Post Office, did apologise for delays in the disclosure of documents, at a hearing in London as part of the public inquiry. He also admitted the Post Office’s disclosure of documents to the inquiry had been “sub-optimal” and said the Post Office provided “inaccurate” information to the high court. Ministers need to “immediately” update the law to acknowledge that computers are fallible or risk a repeat of the Horizon scandal, legal experts say. In English and Welsh law, computers are assumed to be “reliable” unless proven otherwise. The Post Office threatened and lied to the BBC in 2015 ahead of a Panorama programme with a Horizon whistleblower which exposed the scandal, the public broadcaster said. The BBC said experts who were interviewed for the programme were sent intimidating letters by Post Office lawyers, who also sent letters to the broadcaster threatening to sue Panorama. Keir Starmer said only a “handful” of prosecutions linked to the Horizon scandal may have been handled by the Crown Prosecution Service during his tenure as director of public prosecutions. The Labour leader said the CPS handled 4m cases and had 7,000 members of staff while he was leading it. The independent MP Andrew Bridgen has declared receiving £4.4m in loans from the Reclaim party funder Jeremy Hosking. In the register of members’ financial interests, Bridgen said he had received the money between 2020 and 2023 for “legal services provided in relation to a civil case”. Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, is calling for the UK parliament to be recalled to discuss the strikes in Yemen. Yousaf said it was “pretty frustrating” that he was not briefed in advance of the UK and US strikes carried out last night. Rishi Sunak made a surprise visit to Ukraine to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as the UK announced it will provide £2.5bn in military aid to the country over the coming year. Keir Starmer has said Labour will not build the Manchester leg of HS2 if the party gets into power this year. The opposition leader said the current government had “blown the budget” and that “contracts are going to be cancelled”.  We’re closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for all the emails and comments.  Updated at 11.48am GMT    4.30pm GMT   The Post Office has not disclosed any staff WhatsApp messages to the Horizon IT inquiry because they have not been deemed to be relevant, the inquiry has heard. Chris Jackson, a partner at the law firm Burges Salmon which represents the Post Office, told the inquiry it was his understanding that “nobody in the Post Office used WhatsApp to discuss issues of substance”. In communications with the inquiry’s legal team, Jackson’s firm said the Post Office had not identified any collection of WhatsApp messages “reasonably anticipated to be responsive as substantive”, PA news reports. When questioned on the approach taken to WhatsApp messages earlier today, Jackson said: “That is our understanding but we are keeping it under test.”In Tuesday’s communications with the inquiry’s legal team about disclosure, the correspondence read:  Post Office wants to ensure that the inquiry is aware of decisions Post Office has made relating to the collection of data. Accordingly, by way of update, Post Office has not identified ... repositories of WhatsApp messages reasonably anticipated to be responsive as substantive evidence to the inquiry’s terms of reference and completed list of issues so has not collected WhatsApp messages from custodians’ eMedia devices. Post Office will continue to investigate custodians’ WhatsApp usage and will keep decisions relating to the collection of WhatsApp messages under assessment when considering future requests for documents from the inquiry and in light of knowledge acquired through disclosure and structural review processes.  Asked to explain what the passage meant, Jackson said:  We have tested whether it would be needed to be done by asking them questions as to ... do they use WhatsApp and (what) do they use it for? The responses, as I understand it, came back effectively that it is administrative ... so not the situation ... where people would be having substantive discussions of the kind that are being canvassed in other inquiries at the moment. But if that changes, or if we have a reason to believe it changes, then we would revert.  Jason Beer, counsel to the inquiry, asked:  So, if Paula Vennells was intending to attend a meeting and was going to discuss with Angela van den Bogerd beforehand what to say and what not to say, she wouldn’t have used, on your understanding, WhatsApp to do so?  Jackson said:  Based on the information we’ve had, no she wouldn’t. There may have been liaison in terms of who is free on ... what date but, as we understand it, not substantively.  Beer added:  It may be a surprise to a member of the public that nobody in the Post Office used WhatsApp to discuss issues of substance relating to the Horizon system.  Jackson replied: “That is our understanding but we are keeping it under test.”  Updated at 4.47pm GMT    4.26pm GMT   More than 100 deepfake video advertisements impersonating Rishi Sunak were paid to be promoted on Facebook in the last month alone, according to research that has raised alarm about the risk AI poses before the general election. The adverts may have reached as many as 400,000 people – despite appearing to break several of Facebook’s policies – and mark the first time that the prime minister’s image has been doctored in a systematic way en masse. More than £12,929 was spent on 143 adverts, originating from 23 countries including the US, Turkey, Malaysia and the Philippines. They include one with faked footage of a BBC newsreader, Sarah Campbell, appearing to read out breaking news that falsely claims a scandal has erupted around Sunak secretly earning “colossal sums from a project that was initially intended for ordinary citizens”. Meta, which owns Facebook, has been approached for comment. A UK government spokesperson said:  We are working extensively across government to ensure we are ready to rapidly respond to any threats to our democratic processes, through our defending democracy taskforce and dedicated government teams. Our Online Safety Act goes further by putting new requirements on social platforms to swiftly remove illegal misinformation and disinformation – including where it is AI-generated – as soon as they become aware of it.  The government has been holding discussions with regulators including the Electoral Commission, which says new requirements under legislation from 2022 for digital campaign material to include an “imprint” for it will go some way to ensuring voters can see who paid for an ad or is trying to influence them.

With Labour comfortably ahead in the polls, the SNP leader said it is “very clear now” that Starmer will be the next prime minister, PA News reports. The Scottish first minister said backing his party could make Scotland a “Tory-free zone”, and he stressed the role SNP MPs could seek to have on a future UK Labour government. He was speaking as he officially launched the SNP campaign for the general election almost certain to take place at some point this year. Addressing the event in Glasgow, Yousaf said the election is a “huge opportunity for Scotland”. While declaring “Rishi Sunak is finished as PM”, he focused much of his speech on Starmer’s Labour party. Yousaf told the audience of SNP MPs and party supporters:  Keir Starmer doesn’t need Scotland to win the election. Scotland needs SNP MPs to make sure that we are not ignored and that Scotland’s voice is heard.  He said the “fundamental choice before the people of Scotland” was between electing Labour MPs who will “stand up for Keir Starmer and Westminster”, or backing his party to “elect an SNP MP who will stand up for Scotland and ensure we are not ignored”. Yousaf attacked Labour for its support of Brexit, and warned Starmer’s party could follow Conservative policies on areas such as public spending. He said:  Time after time, when people are looking for leadership, Labour under Keir Starmer has been posted missing. With Labour leading the Tories by 20-25 points in the polls, this would be the time for Keir Starmer to be bold and to be radical. Instead, he spends his time attempting to neutralise Tory attacks by imitating their policies.  Yousaf went on to vow his party’s MPs would seek to “work constructively with a Labour government to introduce measures for a fairer country”. But he also promised they would look to prevent a future Labour government from “backsliding on green investment” and look to “protect the NHS from creeping privatisation at Westminster”.  Updated at 4.49pm GMT    3.54pm GMT   Jeremy Hunt knows there is little to celebrate from modest economic growth during November. The 0.3% increase in gross domestic product follows a drop of 0.3% in October, and the three-month figure – which is considered a more reliable and certainly less volatile measure of economic growth – showed a 0.2% contraction to the end of November. The services sector was moribund in the three months to November, while production output fell by 1.5% and construction fell by 0.6% over the same period. Simon French, the chief economist at the stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said the single-month figure showed there was “a decent chance” the UK had again avoided a recession. Sandra Horsfield, a UK economist at Investec, was less sure: “It remains touch-and-go whether the economy tipped into a technical recession in the second half of 2023.” Both were looking through a microscope at small percentage points either side of zero, making it clear that, for the economy and the chancellor, interest rate cuts by the Bank of England cannot come soon enough. Without lower borrowing costs, a period of zero growth stretching back more than a year is likely to continue well into 2024, and with an election less than a year away, that spells disaster for the Conservative administration.

Campaigners have spent decades seeking justice for wronged post office operators, including at least 700 people who were prosecuted by the Post Office and other bodies between 1999 and 2015 based on the botched Horizon IT system. But progress towards addressing one of Britain’s worst miscarriages of justice and providing compensation has been painfully slow. “All three political parties had a role to play,” one former postal affairs minister, the Conservative MP Paul Scully, said this week.  We look at the role played by the three main parties:   Related: Which politicians carry blame in the Post Office IT scandal?       3.22pm GMT   The Post Office’s leadership has been accused of showing contempt for victims after its lawyers informed a public inquiry into one of the nation’s worst scandals that it was not reasonable to expect them to leave no stone unturned in getting to the truth of what happened. The inquiry into the false convictions of 900 post office operators was further told it was unrealistic for the lawyers representing the Post Office and responsible for handing over internal documents to “continue to work during the evenings and over weekends”. The latest revelation from the inquiry, chaired by the retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, emerged out of letters from the Post Office’s lead legal representative, Chris Jackson, a partner at the law firm Burges Salmon LLP. Jackson said his comments in correspondence sent late last year were part of a request to “please discuss” the future processes for disclosing evidence to the inquiry, which has been repeatedly delayed by the failure of the Post Office to promptly hand over documents. Asked whether he believed, on reflection, that his position in his letters was flawed, Jackson said: “No.” The former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis said the attitude of the Post Office and its legal representatives was a “disgrace” and that the organisation’s employment of expensive lawyers to thwart justice was an affront to the victims. He said:  They should ensure that every effort is made to disclose all the documents. The alternative to their own lawyers doing it is that we impose lawyers upon them to sift through their documents.  Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee, which next week will interview the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, said justice required those representing the organisation to work “round the clock”. He said  This is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history, so, bluntly, parliament and the public will expect and demand the Post Office leaves no stone unturned in providing the evidence required so the truth can finally be known. If that requires the Post Office working round the clock to make sure the facts are on the table, then that is what is required. The truth has already taken too long to emerge. There cannot and must not be any further delays.

At the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, the lead counsel Jason Beer has been questioning Chris Jackson, the lawyer acting for the Post Office on disclosures to the panel. Beer pointed out that on 19 December, the Post Office said the disclosure of documents in relation to investigator Stephen Bradshaw’s evidence was complete, before doing a U-turn last Friday and saying 924 further documents would be disclosed. Beer said it “doesn’t make for happy reading” that hundreds of new documents were released at the last minute. It was later found that at least 420 of them were duplicates that had previously been provided. Beer asked Jackson if he agreed that the chain of correspondence had been “rather chaotic”. Jackson replied:  You used the phrase before the lunch break sub-optimal, it is clearly that.  It must be frustrating, particularly for the inquiry, and for witnesses and I suspect for those at the other end trying to get it right.  The hearing has ended for the day and the inquiry will resume again next Tuesday.  Updated at 3.00pm GMT    1.49pm GMT   There will “definitely be escalation” in the Middle East in light of the US-UK strikes in Yemen, an Iranian professor predicts. Seyed Mohammad Marandi, of the University of Tehran, has told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme:  I think that what the British and American governments have done – and the British government doesn’t really play a role, they just want to be in the good books of Washington – but what they have done is that they have created greater instability in the Red Sea.  Asked whether Iran will ask its other proxies to help the Houthis, he says:  Iran doesn’t dictate terms to any of its allies. The government in Yemen, they make their own decisions. Hezbollah makes its own decision. But Iran will support them.  And he says Iranians see the US-led military action “as support for the genocide in Gaza”.  The United States and the British government want to empower the Israeli regime so that they can carry on with what they’re doing to the people of Gaza.   Updated at 2.22pm GMT    1.20pm GMT  Post Office 'understands profound mistrust'  after litany of disclosure failings  A Post Office legal representative has said he understands the “profound mistrust in many quarters” following a litany of disclosure failings throughout the Horizon IT inquiry. A further disclosure setback in November, in which around 363,000 emails were found on a “legacy” mailing system, resulted in witnesses being delayed, PA news reports. In his witness statement submitted to the inquiry before giving evidence on Friday, Chris Jackson, a partner at the law firm Burges Salmon, said the Post Office sent its apologies for the most recent delay. In November, Jason Beer KC said the latest disclosure failing added to a long list of further failings which were “etched” in the minds of the inquiry’s counsel. Before the latest disclosure failings, the inquiry had been delayed by hard copy documents being found in new Post Office locations and the misuse of search terms in the disclosure exercise. Another failing which previously delayed the inquiry was an improper “de-duplication” exercise, meaning relevant emails were not disclosed. Other failings have included a failure to consider “families” of documents, not disclosing the names of those blind copied into emails, and the failure to disclose documents held on back-up tapes. Addressing the disclosure issues in his statement, Jackson said:  The current situation is not one that anyone would wish to see continue. Post Office has asked me to convey its apologies for the current situation and to assure the inquiry and other core participants that it is a Post Office priority to get to a position where hearings (and planning and preparation for hearings) can take place from a stable basis with the risks of further emerging data source issues minimised and managed so far as is practicable.  He continued:  I am conscious that emerging problems with, and frank updates to the inquiry on, Post Office’s disclosure have been deeply and understandably frustrating to the inquiry, to postmasters and their families … and to those witnesses who have been affected. I understand fully the reasons for those reactions and for the profound mistrust in many quarters, which is the starting point for any exchanges on disclosure given the underlying earlier events relating to Horizon that the inquiry is charged to investigate. However, I confirm that all my experience acting for Post Office since May 2023 indicates to me that all the professional advisers working for Post Office on the inquiry … are behaving properly and professionally, working intensively and with significant resource, to provide all requested evidence to the inquiry. Were it ever to be suggested otherwise, that would be a matter of profound professional concern.  Beer previously told the inquiry it was “the conduct” of the Post Office that was “standing in our way” of calling witnesses. He told the inquiry in November:  We as your counsel want to get on with the business of calling witnesses. We as your counsel want to get on with the business of progress in this inquiry. But the conduct of one of the core participants is presently standing in our way. This is of course the latest in a series of disclosure failings by the Post Office – they may be forgotten to many, they are etched in the memory of those who sit on this side of the room.  The inquiry is now taking a break for lunch, resuming business in an hour.  Updated at 1.43pm GMT    1.11pm GMT   Away from the Post Office inquiry, MPs have declared a number of interesting donations and second jobs on the latest register - aside from Andrew Bridgen’s £4m loan.  Keir Starmer accepted £25,000 of hospitality from the government of Qatar for private jet travel from the Cop summit in Dubai to meet the Emir of Qatar in December. The chief executive of Palantir in the UK, Louis Mosley, has given £5,000 to the housing minister Lee Rowley. Palantir has been under the spotlight recently after the controversial US-based firm linked to spy agencies won a £380m NHS data contract. It is understood Mosley and Rowley are former colleagues in the financial services industry and the donation was made on a personal basis to support the MP’s work. Mark Pritchard, a Tory backbencher, has got a new £9,000-a-month job working for an arms company, ATS Group, based in North Macedonia, which specialises in ballistics and ammunition. Sir Bob Stewart, the MP, raised almost £20,000 in crowdfunding to help cover legal costs and a fine associated with his conviction for racially abusing an activist.   Updated at 1.15pm GMT    12.59pm GMT  Post Office provided 'inaccurate and misleading' information to high court, lawyer admits  The Post Office provided “inaccurate and misleading” information to the high court, one its lawyers has admitted to the inquiry into the Horizon scandal. At the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, the lead counsel to the inquiry, Jason Beer referred to an initial witness statement by Chris Jackson, the lawyer acting for the Post Office and asked if it was right to say that “inaccurate and misleading” information was provided in an important disclosure questionnaire. The questionnaire was initially provided to the high court and later resubmitted to both the court of appeal and the inquiry. Jackson agrees there was a replication of inaccuracies. The inaccuracies were to do with email archive data and the transferral of emails. The public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has been repeatedly halted by obstacles such as a “series of disclosure failings” and claims of lost emails by the Post Office.  Updated at 1.18pm GMT    12.35pm GMT   At the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, the lead counsel to the inquiry, Jason Beer, asked Chris Jackson, the lawyer acting for the Post Office, about the “chance discovery” of a document that has led to questions over whether there is a separate repository of emails that aren’t on the cloud service Mimecast. Late last year, the company admitted that its auditors had discovered 363,000 emails on an old mailing system that had not been used since 2012. A lawyer for the Post Office said at the time that it “deeply regretted” the delay and blamed, somewhat poignantly, technical faults. The document came to light during a freedom of information request made in May 2023. Beer said were it not for the FoI request “the racist and archaic identity code document would not have emerged”. This is a reference to how that document showed fraud investigators were asked to group suspects based on racial features. The document, which was published between 2008 and 2011, included the term “negroid types”, along with “Chinese/Japanese types” and “dark-skinned European types”. In May 2023, the Post Office apologised for using racist terms to describe post office operators wrongly accused as part of the scandal.  Updated at 1.34pm GMT    12.18pm GMT   The Post Office’s email systems are being discussed at the hearing today.  Counsel to the inquiry Jason Beer KC issued a warning:  I’m afraid this is super dry.  Beer has been asking Chris Jackson, the lawyer acting for the Post Office, what different systems were used to send emails and when these systems were used. This is important because previous statements have been made regarding lost emails and the knock-on effect it has had in trying to extract information relevant and of use to the inquiry.     11.53am GMT   The independent MP Andrew Bridgen has declared receiving £4.4m in loans from the Reclaim party funder Jeremy Hosking. In the register of members’ financial interests, Bridgen said he had received the money between 2020 and 2023 for “legal services provided in relation to a civil case”. The Times previously reported the loans were to help Bridgen, who represents North West Leicestershire, fund a legal battle with his brother over the family’s potato farm. Bridgen had not declared the loan when he joined the Reclaim party and became its first MP in May last year, after being expelled from the Conservatives for comparing Covid vaccine side-effects to the Holocaust. Reclaim, a rightwing populist party led by Laurence Fox, is almost entirely funded by Hosking, who helped create it in 2020. The parliamentary code of conduct states MPs must declare any financial interest which might reasonably be thought by others to influence their actions, speeches or votes in parliament, or actions taken in his or her capacity as a MP. Bridgen quit Reclaim in December citing a “difference in the direction of the party”. He has been involved in a long-running multimillion-pound legal dispute with his relatives over the family business, the vegetable supplier AB Produce, which the Times reported led to him being evicted from his country house and found by a high court judge to have lied under oath.  Updated at 1.35pm GMT    11.27am GMT   A letter from Chris Jackson’s legal firm which was sent to the inquiry on 16 October 2023 was raised during the morning session of the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry. Lead counsel to the Inquiry, Jason Beer KC said during a review of 402,000 documents – and the production of more than 11,300 documents, just 2.82% were disclosed to the inquiry. Beer then says: “Looking at this now, does it appear to be a flawed approach?” “No,” Jackson says. The letter reads:  The principle of reasonableness in relation to disclosure to the Inquiry - even if operating at the more stringent end of the spectrum - does not, and cannot, require POL to leave every [sic] stone unturned. Such a standard is impossible for POL to realistically comply with. There POL does not intend to adopt a similar approach to future requests having regards to the low rates of relevance.   Updated at 11.47am GMT    11.14am GMT  Post Office apologises over disclosure delays to inquiry into scandal  Chris Jackson, the lawyer acting for the Post Office, has apologised for delays in the disclosure of documents at a hearing in London as part of the inquiry into the Horizon scandal. He is being questioned by the lead counsel to the Inquiry, Jason Beer KC. The inquiry is today looking at process failings and potentially “deeper rooted problems” relating to the Post Office’s disclosure. Late last year, Beer accused the Post Office of “standing in the way of the inquiry and preventing progress”. During today’s hearing Beer reminded the inquiry that there have not just been problems with disclosure but the Post Office has also been accused, in several court cases, of failing to produce evidence. In his witness statement, Jackson said:  The Post Office has asked me to convey its apologies for the current situation and to assure the inquiry and other core participants that it is a post office priority to get to a position where hearings (and planning and preparation for hearings) can take place from a stable basis.   Updated at 11.17am GMT    11.07am GMT  Only a 'handful' of prosecutions linked to Horizon scandal handled by CPS during my tenure, Starmer says  Keir Starmer said only a “handful” of prosecutions linked to the Horizon scandal may have been handled by the Crown Prosecution Service during his tenure as director of public prosecutions. The Labour leader said the Crown Prosecution Service handled 4 million cases and had 7,000 members of staff while he was leading it. Speaking to broadcasters during a visit to Bury, he said:  I think it’s very important to be clear that these were, or the vast majority of these were, Post Office prosecutions brought by the Post Office in relation to their cases. A small number, at the moment it looks like there may have been three or so, a handful of cases, in the five years that I was director of public prosecutions that were handled by the Crown Prosecution Service.  He said it was “not even known what the detail of those cases are and it needs to be put in its context: in the five years I was director of public prosecutions I had 7,000 staff and we handled 4 million cases. So this was a handful, within that.”  More details will emerge no doubt ... it’s not clear whether they’re in the cohort of cases of concern or not.   Updated at 11.12am GMT    11.03am GMT   My colleague Rob Davies has put together an explainer about why progress in the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has been repeatedly halted by obstacles, many of them put in place by the Post Office itself. The company, which is wholly owned by the state and thus the British taxpayer, has been accused of trying to slow down or frustrate attempts to piece together its part in what has been described by the prime minister himself as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history. The inquiry is currently examining this very issue, at a hearing that is taking aim at “deep rooted” problems with the Post Office’s disclosure. Chris Jackson, a partner at the organisation’s law firm, Burges Salmon, is giving evidence. Burges Salmon replaced the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills as the Post Office’s recognised legal representative from 1 September 2023. Here are some of the ways the Post Office has appeared to pull the shutters down to protect itself:   Related: Lost emails and last-ditch finds: how the Post Office inquiry was delayed       10.40am GMT   The Liberal Democrats have called for a retrospective vote on the military action in the Red Sea and called for MPs to be recalled to parliament. The party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, said:  Parliament should not be bypassed. Rishi Sunak must announce a retrospective vote in the House of Commons on these strikes, and recall parliament this weekend. We remain very concerned about the Houthis’ attacks. But that makes it all the more important to ensure that MPs are not silenced on the important issue of military action.   Updated at 11.15am GMT    10.37am GMT   Ministers need to “immediately” update the law to acknowledge that computers are fallible or risk a repeat of the Horizon scandal, legal experts say. In English and Welsh law, computers are assumed to be “reliable” unless proven otherwise. But critics of this approach say this reverses the burden of proof normally applied in criminal cases. Stephen Mason, a barrister and expert on electronic evidence, said: “It says, for the person who’s saying ‘there’s something wrong with this computer’, that they have to prove it. Even if it’s the person accusing them who has the information.” Mason, along with eight other legal and computer experts, was invited by the government to suggest an update to the law in 2020, following a high court ruling against the Post Office, but the recommendations they submitted were never applied. He and colleagues had been expressing alarm about the presumption as far back as 2009. Mason said:  My view is that the Post Office would never have got anywhere near as far as it did if this presumption wasn’t in place.  The legal presumption that computers are reliable stems from an older common law principle that “mechanical instruments” should be presumed to be in working order unless proven otherwise. That assumption means that if, for instance, a police officer quotes the time on their watch, a defendant cannot force the prosecution to call a horologist to explain from first principles how watches work. For a period, computers lost that protection in England and Wales. A 1984 act of parliament ruled that computer evidence was only admissible if it could be shown that the computer was used and operating properly. But that act was repealed in 1999, just months before the first trials of the Horizon system began.

The inquiry was set up in 2020, and upgraded to a statutory inquiry a year later, and has been holding public hearings for almost two years. But the scandal is now getting much more media attention than before as a direct result of the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office broadcast after Christmas. Sir Wyn Williams, chair of the inquiry, announced his intention to hold the hearing after evidence from representatives of the Post Office, Herbert Smith Freehills and KPMG revealed process failings and potentially “deeper rooted problems” relating to the Post Office’s disclosure.  The chair said:   There is a need for close monitoring of the disclosure process during the remainder of the Inquiry especially as it relates to disclosure by the Post Office.  He has therefore called Chris Jackson, partner of Burges Salmon LLP, to give evidence. Burges Salmon replaced Herbert Smith Freehills as the Post Office’s recognised legal representative from 1 September 2023.  You can watch the inquiry here:        10.18am GMT   Keir Starmer has said Labour will not build the Manchester leg of HS2 if the party gets into power this year. The opposition leader said the current government had “blown the budget” and that “contracts are going to be cancelled”. However, speaking on BBC North West Tonight, he said Labour was “committed” to Northern Powerhouse Rail to improve connections in the north. He added:  I want that designed and built in the North and therefore I’m talking to Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram about what are the needs of the people in the North West so that the plan can actually deliver what works for them.      10.11am GMT   Scotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf is calling for parliament to be recalled to discuss the UK action in Yemen. Yousaf said it was “pretty frustrating” that he was not briefed in advance of the UK and US strikes carried out last night.  He said there was “no equivocation” that the SNP aligns itself with the UN security council resolution calling for an end to Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea but that the UK’s record of military intervention in Middle East “is not a good one”.  The correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament to have given serious detail about any proposed military action because there are significant questions.  He said that, despite the UK insisting that this has nothing to do with the conflict between Israel and Gaza “that is a complete fallacy and the concern is that there will be a wider regional escalation because of the action taken”  My concern also is that we see thousands of children are dying in Gaza, and I just wish the UK government would care as much about those children that are dying.

It comes as the Ukrainian president presses allies in the West to provide the country with more support to fight back against Russian forces, amid fears that interest in the war is flagging among allies as the war drags on. Sunak said:  For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy. I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.  The prime minister made his first visit to Ukraine in November 2022, weeks after entering Number 10.

The BBC said experts who were interviewed for the programme were sent intimidating letters by Post Office lawyers who also sent letters to the broadcaster, threatening to sue Panorama. According to the BBC, senior Post Office managers also told the broadcaster at the time that no staff or the company who developed Horizon, Fujitsu, could access post office operators accounts, despite being warned four years earlier this was possible. The BBC says the claims did not stop the programme, titled Trouble at the Post Office, but it did delay the broadcast of the show. The Post Office has been contacted for comment. It told the BBC it will not comment while the public inquiry continues. The Post Office scandal has been described without exaggeration by the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in UK history: the hounding and prosecution of thousands of people who owned and ran smaller post offices for alleged fraud between 1999 and 2015, the overwhelming majority of whom were falsely accused. More than 700 post office operators were handed criminal convictions after faulty Fujitsu accounting software made it appear as though money was missing at their branches. Victims have described being shunned by their communities, financially ruined and having their families destroyed. The Post Office public inquiry into the scandal continues in London today.

        "content": "Voters who believe in independence must vote for the Scottish National party in the coming general election, Humza Yousaf has said in a direct appeal to wavering supporters. Earlier this week, in his first major speech of the new year, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, urged independence supporters to defect from the SNP to “boot the Tories out” of Downing Street. But the SNP leader, launching his party’s general election campaign in Glasgow on Friday, had a blunt message for those whom polls indicate are drifting towards Labour: “If you believe decisions about Scotland should be taken in Scotland – if you believe in independence – then you must vote SNP. If you want to see an independent Scotland, you have to get out and vote for it.” Yousaf said Keir Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland to win the election”. This has been a consistent Labour argument, with Starmer himself describing the party’s victory over the SNP at the Rutherglen and Hamilton byelection last October as a “milestone” on its route back to Downing Street.   Related: Scottish Labour leader appeals to pro-independence voters to ‘boot Tories out’   The SNP leader said “Scotland does need SNP MPs to make sure we aren’t ignored,” and that his politicians would “keep [Starmer] honest”. Telling assembled MPs, MSPs and activists that Rishi Sunak was “done” and claiming it was clear that Starmer would be the next prime minister, he offered to “work constructively” with a Labour government to prevent backsliding on green investment or the creeping privatisation of the NHS. Countering Sarwar’s pledge that electing more Labour MPs would “maximise Scottish influence”, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, said that any Scottish Labour MPs elected would “take independence off the table” as soon as they got to the Commons. Yousaf set his party an ambitious target of winning all six Tory seats at the forthcoming general election, which Sunak has suggested could take place in the autumn, in order “to wipe the Tories from Scotland’s electoral map”. He added that, in more than half of the SNP-held seats, it was the Tories who were in second place. Yousaf said: “So to people right across the country, our message will be very clear: vote SNP for a Scotland free from Tory MPs.” Regardless of his certainty about a Labour victory, the SNP leader said Labour and Tories were “offering more of the same”. He added: “History has shown us that the only certainty of a Labour government is that it will be followed by another Tory government. Scotland needs more than just a brief respite from the damage of Tory rule.” While urging activists in the room to “work harder than ever to ensure Scotland gains her independence”, he offered no concrete sense of how independence would be achieved, beyond the multifaceted and – according to some senior SNP politicians – over-complicated strategy passed at party conference last October. The conference agreed that, if the SNP wins a majority of Scotland’s seats at the general election, it will have the mandate to negotiate independence with the UK government, but this does not address the likely scenario of a continued block on a second referendum from Westminster. He told reporters after the launch: “If you want the independence cause to be advancing, then the SNP should be winning … if that’s not the case, then those who oppose independence will say that’s a mandate for further Westminster control.” Both Yousaf and Flynn also urged Sunak to recall parliament to allow for debate on UK military action in Yemen, and reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Challenges for the SNP heading into a general election 1. UK Labour’s electability With polls indicating that Scottish Labour and the SNP are toe-to-toe in Westminster voting intention, focus groups suggest that Sarwar’s increasingly direct appeals to independence supporters are working. Sarwar and Starmer’s message is simple enough: now is the time for Scottish voters to unite, regardless of previous differences over independence or Brexit, and vote for change. In contrast, after 16 years in government in Edinburgh and with voters’ once cast-iron belief in SNP competence dwindling amid crumbling public services, Yousaf is struggling to offer a similarly appealing story. 2. Voters are in no hurry for independence While the Scottish government continues to publish its series of papers setting out the updated case for independence, these are increasingly prone to accusations of fantasy, while voters make it plain that even though supportive of separation in the long term they want politicians’ immediate focus to be on the cost of living crisis. This sea change in Scottish politics over the last year or so, as voters decouple their constitutional preference from party preference for the first time since the 2014 referendum, is a serious headache for SNP strategists. The multi-pronged independence strategy agreed at SNP conference offers little to counter the continuing hard fact that a second referendum requires the agreement of the UK government. 3. Taxing the rich? Yousaf’s political rivals are already taking every opportunity to attack him on tax. The Scottish Tories are warning of brain-drain after the new tax band for higher earners introduced in December’s draft budget. Scottish Labour has asked how progressive it is that anyone earning more than £29,000 in Scotland already pays more tax than they would in England and Wales while council tax remains frozen, benefiting those with larger properties while starving councils of funding for services that low earners rely upon. If Jeremy Hunt reduces income tax rates in England and Wales as expected in his spring statement, the tax gap north of the border may widen further. The SNP government argues these tax increases will help offset the effects of real-terms funding cuts in Westminster’s block grant for Scotland, but with deep cuts announced in the budget across sectors, this will be a tough sell. 4. Police inquiry into SNP finances It may have been out of the headlines in recent months, but Operation Branchform, the Police Scotland investigation into claims that the party misspent £600,000 of donations, is yet to conclude. Already the subject of countless memes, the image of the forensic tent in former party leader Nicola Sturgeon’s garden – and the suspicion of at best mismanagement and at worst criminal wrongdoing – is likely to figure on plenty of campaign material. The effect is not only on voters: the party has also struggled to persuade stalwart activists, usually the backbone of its campaigning, to knock on doors, with many disillusioned by the fallout."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has said he will make a statement to MPs on Monday about “limited and necessary” military strikes in Yemen, which he insisted were carried out in self-defence after a series of attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\nLindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, said MPs should be updated “at the earliest possible opportunity” and that he would recall parliament at the weekend if needed, but the prime minister said this was not required.\nIn a TV clip recorded in Kyiv before talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Sunak said inaction over the attacks on ships by Houthi rebels, including a barrage seemingly aimed at western warships, risked destabilising the global economy.\n“Over the last month, we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea that’s putting innocent lives at risk,” the prime minister said. “It’s disrupting the global economy, and it’s also destabilising the region. And in that time, we’ve also seen the single biggest attack on a British navy warship that we’ve seen in decades.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSunak described the US-led strike as “limited and necessary action in response to a specific threat in self-defence”, which was intended to “degrade and disrupt Houthi capability”.\nAsked what would happen if the strikes did not curb Houthi attacks on shipping, Sunak replied: “Initial indications are that their strides have been successful. We’ll continue to monitor the situation. But it’s clear that this type of behaviour can’t be met without a response.”\nHoyle said in a statement released by his office after the UK’s involvement in the attacks on Houthi forces: “I was invited to a meeting at the Cabinet Office last night to be briefed about the airstrikes on Houthi rebel bases. I made representations to the deputy prime minister [Oliver Dowden] about the need for the house to be informed at the earliest possible opportunity and that I would be happy to facilitate a recall at any time.”\nThe Commons ended its business for the week on Thursday and is not due to reconvene before Monday afternoon. MPs can be recalled to sit over weekends if there is an urgent matter to consider. So far the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party have called for MPs to sit over the weekend. Labour has only said Sunak should update parliament as soon as possible and it is understood the party is happy for this to be on Monday.\n Interactive\n\nSpeaking in Kyiv, Sunak said an early recall was not needed. “If you look at similar situations in 2015 and 2018, a statement was made to parliament after the action and that’s what I will be doing on Monday – I’ll be making a full statement in parliament and taking questions.”\nLayla Moran, the Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said there was a need for MPs to have a say. “Parliament should not be bypassed,” she said. “Rishi Sunak must announce a retrospective vote in the House of Commons on these strikes and recall parliament this weekend.\n“We remain very concerned about the Houthis’ attacks. But that makes it all the more important to ensure that MPs are not silenced on the important issue of military action.”\nThe strikes on Thursday night were the first to be launched against Houthi forces since they started targeting shipping in the Red Sea, a key international trade route.\nThe Ministry of Defence said four Royal Air Force jets struck two Houthi facilities that were involved in the targeting of HMS Diamond and US navy vessels on Tuesday. One was a site in Bani, in the country’s north-west, and the other was the Abs airfield, near the west coast. The US air force said it struck more than 60 targets at 16 sites in Yemen.\n Interactive\n\nThe UK and US had non-operational support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.\nMinisters were summoned to a cabinet video call on Thursday evening before the attacks, with Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, briefed afterwards.\nStarmer said subsequently that a summary of the government’s legal position on the attacks should be published. “I do want the prime minister obviously to make a statement to parliament as soon as possible because the scope, nature and extent of the operation needs to be explained,” he said.\nSunak, in a separate trip to Ukraine on Friday that was not billed in advance by No 10, met Zelenskiy as the UK announced it would provide further military aid to Ukraine over the coming year.\n• The second video in this article was amended on 19 January 2024 to remove footage of an explosion that was from a different incident, dating back to at least September 2023."

        "content": "“A sinking ship” was how Antonia, an administrator from Middleton, described Britain at the start of 2024. That assessment, while damning, isn’t unusual, with “broken”, “mess” and “struggling” the top words used to describe the UK today. But Antonia, and her fellow focus group participants – former Conservative voters from the “red wall” seats of Heywood and Middleton, Great Grimsby and Dudley North – weren’t planning on expressing their exasperation with the state of Britain by voting Labour. Instead, they were tempted by the successor to the Brexit party – Reform UK. Since October, Reform has enjoyed a steady rise in support, hitting 10% in some opinion polls. While unlikely to win seats of their own, by attracting former Tory voters Reform could play the role of spoiler. An analysis by the thinktank More in Common suggests that at present polling levels Reform could enable more than 30 additional Conservative losses. Given that potential to play an outsize role in the election, the focus group aimed to find out what was attracting voters to the shape-shifting party – and whether these voters would stick with them come election day. Unsurprisingly, immigration was high on their list. Jordan, a technician, felt the UK’s “soft touch” attracted too many immigrants. Darron, a fraud prevention officer, expressed annoyance that people could no longer stay in the hotel where he got married because it is now used to house asylum seekers. Maria, a support worker, was worried after hearing about GP surgery funds being spent on translation rather than patients’ medical care. Their frustration was compounded by a sense that politicians didn’t care or even wanted higher immigration to keep wages low. Asked what they wanted to be done instead to reduce immigration, the group supported an Australian-style points system – which meant Britain could still attract the seasonal, NHS and care workers they all felt were needed. They seemed unaware or unconvinced that the government had introduced exactly that. Even so, immigration was not their top concern. For this group, as with almost every other, it was the cost of living that dominated; the fall in inflation was of little comfort as they still felt the pinch. Energy costs had become so bad that Dale, a train supervisor, and Steve, a pensioner, had taken to living as much as possible from their beds to reduce heating costs. Jordan worried at the end of almost every month whether his salary would last. There was real anger towards those profiting from misery. Jordan said: “When you see the record-breaking profits [of energy companies] it’s like a kick in the nuts.” Darron fumed at “multinational corporations making billions and billions in profit and hiding their money offshore” and Dale said the public suffer while politicians’ “mates are doing well”. In fact, immigration aside, when this group talked about corporate greed, NHS underfunding or the PPE scandal, you could be forgiven for presuming this was in fact a group of hardcore Jeremy Corbyn supporters, rather than voters tempted to back the populist right. Their biggest dismay was with the UK’s politicians. On Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, they were unsparing, questioning how someone “worth a billion dollars” could understand working people’s concerns. Maria, a support worker, explained she had “broken ranks” in 2019 to vote Tory but under Sunak the party weren’t “looking after ordinary working-class folk”. They were similarly unimpressed by Sunak’s Labour opponent. While the group expected a Labour victory this year, they dismissed Keir Starmer as “more of the same”, a “Red Tory”. Others thought (mistakenly) that he had defended Jimmy Savile and couldn’t vote for him as a result. Two politicians did get better reviews. While questioning Boris Johnson’s judgment (“how can you trust someone happy to have Cummings as an adviser?” asked Darron), most shared the view of Maria, who felt that although the former prime minister had been “extremely naughty” she still had a soft spot for him. Lee, a builder, said he was refreshing and that he’d want him “any day” over Sunak. The other politician to meet the focus group’s approval was Nigel Farage. Jordan felt he was “down to earth” and Emily found it hard to disagree with lots he said. Even Maria, who was disappointed she hadn’t seen the Brexit £350m, said she’d forgive Farage and give him another chance. That absence of a Boris or Farage figure went to the heart of the group’s worries about voting Reform. No one could name Richard Tice, the current Reform leader, and at least half of the group felt that even if they liked Reform a vote for them would just let Labour in. Others took a different view – Antonia was happy to waste her vote “to show she didn’t want to vote for other parties” while Maria was “done with Labour and the Conservatives”. If this group is anything to go by, the success of Reform UK and the damage they ultimately cause to the Conservatives will be determined by which of those sentiments wins out. Can Sunak persuade would-be Reform voters that they’ll be letting Labour in through the back door, or does anger with a “rigged system” make even a “wasted vote” a price worth paying to shake up the system?

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and shadow defence secretary, John Healey, will be briefed after the call, it is understood.\nThe prime minister used a conversation with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi earlier on Thursday to discuss the disruption in the Red Sea and emphasise that Britain would continue to “take action to defend freedom of navigation and protect lives”, No 10 said.\nAntony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said further attacks by the Yemeni rebels on international shipping could prompt a western military response. Any UK strikes are expected to involve US forces.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, told reporters at a press briefing to “watch this space” regarding British action in the Red Sea, and accused Iran of helping the Houthis with intelligence and surveillance.\nIn a statement released before the briefing, Shapps said: “The UK alongside allies have previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences.”\nThe US, UK and 10 other western countries have made a joint declaration warning the Houthis of consequences in the event of continued attacks against merchant shipping in the southern Red Sea.\nShapps said the missile and drone attack had represented an escalation. He said a British destroyer, HMS Diamond, shot down seven Iranian-designed drones and he indicated the vessel had been “potentially” targeted by the Houthis.\n Interactive\n\nSince Tuesday’s incident and the comments by Shapps, Downing Street has faced repeated questions about whether and when the UK might make a response.\nUK military action is traditionally followed by a statement to parliament. However, the House of Commons finished its business for the week on Thursday afternoon, and if Sunak or Shapps did choose to address MPs, there would be a risk of many not being able to attend.\nThe Liberal Democrats said MPs should be recalled. Layla Moran, the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, said: “If the UK plans to take military action, it’s vital there is a vote in parliament. The prime minister must make arrangements for a recall of parliament if strikes are planned before Monday.”\nScotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, posted on X that Westminster should be recalled. He wrote: “The UK does not have a good record of military intervention in the Middle East. It is therefore incumbent that Westminster is recalled, MPs briefed and allowed to debate and scrutinise any decision to pursue military action that the UK government is proposing.”\nThe SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, also said MPs should be recalled, calling the situation in the Red Sea “complex and serious”."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has given permission for Labour shadow ministers to start talks with civil servants about how they would run a government should they win the election later this year – a routine but nonetheless symbolic process before a possible handover of power. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “In line with the longstanding process set out in the cabinet manual, the prime minister has authorised access talks between the official opposition and civil service.” The cabinet secretary, Simon Case, would “oversee and arrange these discussions”, the statement added. A Labour source confirmed that the party had received the letter confirming what are formally known as access talks on Thursday evening, and would reply “in due course”. The discussions are a necessary step so that an opposition party can step immediately into government if they win an election. The talks must be authorised by the prime minister.  For a period in the 2000s, the prime minister would do this in advance at the start of parliament, meaning they could begin whenever needed. But under David Cameron that practice ended, and, under Sunak, Downing Street has faced repeated questions in recent weeks about when he would grant permission before an election that could happen as early as spring, although autumn is now seen as more likely. An Institute for Government study of the practice showed that in elections since 1992, access talks began anywhere from 16 months before the election to a matter of weeks. In 2017, they were authorised on the day Theresa May called the election, leaving just 51 days for Labour to speak to officials. There is, similarly, no formal guidance on how often the meeting should take place. The IfG briefing cites the experience of Ed Balls, who said that in 1997, as a special adviser to the shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown, he met the chief civil servant in the Treasury “maybe once or twice a week, for two or three hours at a time” in the run-up to the election."

        "content": "It is sometimes a matter of timing. The government is just about the last handful of halfwits who believe that the new legislation to exonerate post office operators would have been rushed through this week regardless of the ITV drama. Only on Thursday morning, the delusional energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, was telling BBC Breakfast that the whole thing was a total coincidence. That justice for post office operators had been at the top of Rishi Sunak’s inbox since – “Ooh, let me think” – well before Christmas. The rest of us live in the real world. But what goes around, comes around. The biter bit. Had Mr Bates vs the Post Office been scheduled for broadcast next week, then there’s every chance that next to no one would have been following the resumption of the year-long and counting inquiry at Aldwych House in central London. In which case, Stephen Bradshaw, a former lead Post Office investigator, would just have had an uncomfortable day in the witness stand being interrogated by inquiry counsel, Julian Blake. After which he could have gone home and forgotten all about it. Not now. The country is seized with indignation. An indignation all the more righteous for most of us having taken our eyes off the ball. People want those responsible for perpetuating one of the worst miscarriages of justice over a period of 25 years to be named and shamed. They are now watching every move. It wasn’t just a full house in the inquiry room, there were nearly 5,000 following online. And it was just Bradshaw’s bad luck that he was the first witness of this new era. He was the one whose face would be on the TV. His was the face who would be in all the newspapers. He would be the one who would now be easily identifiable to all his neighbours. The careless whispers, the twitching curtains. People avoiding him in the street. But in a sense it was also poetic justice. Because Bradshaw never lost a moment’s sleep over the effect the flawed Post Office investigations were having on any of the operators. Not his problem if others suffered acute mental health crises or were made bankrupt. If you can’t do the time, don’t commit the crime. Nor did Bradshaw ever appear to express any remorse for what he had done. No culpability. In fact, you could almost believe that he thought the operators were still guilty of something. He just wasn’t sure what. I suspect that’s a corporate mindset. That Paula Vennells and the rest of the Post Office boss class – both former and current – still feel the same way. That somehow the operators are getting away with it. That deep down it’s the Post Office and Fujitsu that are the real victims in this. Right from the off, Bradshaw was defensive. Not on his home turf and often looking towards his own solicitor for reassurance. But he was on his own. Blake began by taking him through his written statement to the inquiry. Did he not now regret that he had not reflected a little more on the cases he had investigated? Had paused to think and join the dots? Bradshaw shook his head. It was well above his pay grade to be asked to think. He just kept his head down and did as he was told. OK, said Blake. Well, allow me to help you break the habit of a lifetime. Maybe we could just run through the evidence and you tell me what comes into your mind. A gentle word association game. So you’ve said that you never had any idea that the Horizon system was defective. Now let me take you through a document trail that shows you were well aware of the Computer Weekly story back in 2009 and that many operators were reporting problems. Oh, that. Bradshaw sat back. No. None of that counted. Because the only knowledge that really counted was what Post Office bosses were telling him. Anything he might have picked up himself was just gossip. Trivia. Unreliable evidence. Knowledge was not really knowledge until he had been told it was genuine knowledge by Paula and the teams. Just like he could only trust the football scores when they had come from the Post Office PR team. And at no time did the Post Office bosses tell him there was a problem, so in his mind there wasn’t a problem. At all times he had only said and done what the Post Office lawyers had told him to do. In any case, Horizon was only a distraction. A secondary mitigation from the obviously guilty hoping for a reduced sentence. The crime he was investigating was the missing money. No one could account for it. Therefore they were banged to rights. Simples. Not that he was an investigator per se. At least he was, but only to a limited extent. He only investigated what he was told to investigate. He wasn’t paid to use his intelligence to follow different leads in an investigation. So when operators came up with similar stories about Horizon, they were obviously all in it together. That’s why it made no sense to inform the defence teams there were defects in the system as it would only encourage them. Though that too would have been above his paygrade. His job was merely to secure as many convictions as possible. At least that’s how it appeared. Like all staff he was paid an annual bonus. “Just for doing my job well,” he said. “Not on successful prosecutions.” Really? Hard to see Paula splashing the cash to employees who went public with the Post Office’s malign culture. Besides, Bradshaw didn’t seem like that kind of guy. He’s a company man through and through. Been at the Post Office man and boy. Used to doing exactly what his bosses required. That’s why he was happy to plea bargain with operators so long as they didn’t bad mouth Horizon. As he went through case after case that the appeal court had deemed to be an affront to justice, Bradshaw still couldn’t see the similarities. Any pattern to the Post Office trying to conceal evidence from the defence was just coincidence. A lawyer’s problem, not his. And did he ever wonder why so many people called the Horizon helpline so frequently? He shrugged. Perhaps because they wanted to express their gratitude that it was working so well. That’s something I’m sure we could all get behind."

        "content": "The government consumed more than 1,400 bottles of wine and spirits at the taxpayer’s expense and topped up its cellar with £27,000 of fresh stock during the two years of the Covid pandemic from 2020 to 2022, new figures show. The report on the government’s wine cellar was published on Thursday after repeated delays. It showed that 130 bottles were consumed during the year to March 2021, while a further 1,300 were drunk during the year to March 2022. The consumption was a drastic drop compared with the 3,000 to 5,000 bottles of wine and spirits usually consumed in a year as the government scaled back its activity during lockdown and the lack of international travel. The cellar is meant to “provide guests of the government, from home and overseas, with wines of appropriate quality at reasonable cost”. But a large amount was still spent during the Covid crisis on topping up reserves. From March 2020 to 2021, £14,621 was splashed out on 516 bottles of red bordeaux wines, costing about £28 each. The government spent £12,356 on English and Welsh sparkling wines in the year from March 2021, with 636 bottles – including 180 magnums – at an average cost of £19. It also bought 18 bottles of gin, and four bottles each of whisky and liqueurs that year. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said in a written statement: “All events organised by government hospitality during this period were done so in strict accordance with Covid-19 restrictions.” But the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, said: “For months, we have asked why the government was suppressing the publication of this report, and now we know the answer. While the rest of the country was facing Covid restrictions and a cost of living crisis, the government was getting through 1,433 bottles from its wine cellar, and replenishing the stocks with a net spend of more than £100,000 over the three years from 2019-22. They lived the high life at taxpayers’ expense while the rest of the country struggled, and it will never be forgotten.” Earlier, Tory MP Sir Charles Walker told the House of Commons that shoppers should consider buying “two or three bottles” of Australian wine to “show solidarity” with the nation. MPs heard the country’s industry has been harmed by China’s imposition of tariffs on Australian wine."

        "content": "The British foreign secretary, David Cameron, has urged Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying it will do nothing for hostages held in the territory or Israel’s war aims if the situation turns into an even greater catastrophe. Writing for the Guardian, Cameron assembles a mass of practical steps that Israel could implement to save lives and avert the risk of hunger turning into famine. “Death and despair haunt these children’s lives. We know we must act,” he writes.   Related: Israel must act now to let aid through and save lives in Gaza. Britain has a plan to help that happen | David Cameron   The foreign secretary is heavily invested in the issue personally and politically since he has insisted that a full ceasefire is not necessary for the levels of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza to be transformed. His stance puts him at odds with senior Israeli military officials, such as Col Moshe Tetro, the head of the Israeli army unit responsible for the delivery of humanitarian aid, who said at a briefing on Wednesday: “There is no food shortage in Gaza” and “the reserves in Gaza are sufficient for the near term”. Tetro, who works for Cogat, the Israeli military’s civil agency for the Palestinian territories, denied any bottlenecks at the Israeli end were preventing aid from reaching Gaza, asserting: “The problem lies with the international organisations processing and receiving the aid.” By contrast, Cameron says he has not only identified bottlenecks that were leading to aid piling up while waiting to enter Gaza, but has found practical ways to unblock them that would allow “more aid delivered by land, more quickly and more effectively”. “The situation is desperate – and projected to get worse,” he writes. “According to the World Food Programme, nine out of every 10 Palestinians in northern Gaza may be having less than one meal a day.” He says the number of aid convoys, which are creeping up towards 200 a day, needs to reach 500. “It would do nothing for those hostages or Israel’s war aims if the situation turns into an even greater catastrophe,” he writes, insisting “there is much more we can do which will make an immediate difference”. Although Cameron said the blockages could not be fixed by one country, most of his proposals were directed at Israel. He urged more crossing points to be opened and for all existing crossing points to be open for longer hours and seven days a week, rather than shut completely on most of Friday and Saturday. Echoing calls made in a separate Guardian interview with Scott Anderson, the deputy director of the UN agency for Palestinians in Gaza, the foreign secretary says it is vital that Israel show greater consistency in the goods allowed into the territory. “More rational and transparent explanations of what is restricted by Israel and why will allow governments, aid organisations and the private sector to scale up aid considerably,” he writes. Cameron praised the UN and challenged Israel to do more to allow aid to be distributed within Gaza. “It is no good getting aid in if it cannot be safely and effectively distributed. More visas and imports of vehicles for them will mean their staff can enter Gaza, enhancing our confidence that aid reaches those in genuine need,” he writes. He rejected air drops as being too expensive and less effective than road deliveries. He called on Israel to restore water supplies, electricity lines and allow fuel into Gaza to allow bakeries to reopen. Earlier this week the UK’s most senior Foreign Office civil servant, Sir Philip Barton, acknowledged that as an occupying power Israel had a duty under international humanitarian law to provide water to Palestinians. Cameron says he supports a “sustainable ceasefire” rather than the immediate ceasefire “some say we must have”, but his checklist of action, by being specific, obtainable and largely in line with the demands from UN agencies in Gaza, may place a new pressure on Israel to respond, or add fuel to the claims that it is content to let Palestinians suffer. In his Guardian interview Anderson said the south of Gaza was rapidly becoming a “pressure cooker” that could explode."

        "content": "  5.45pm GMT  Afternoon summary - with a verdict on Stephen Bradshaw's evidence to Post Office inquiry   An inquiry hearing has provided a vivid insight into why victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal feel the organisation is still a long way from accepting its culpability for what has been described as one of Britain’s biggest miscarriages of justice. The inquiry has been hearing evidence in public for almost two years, and veterans of the hearings were not surprised by the evidence from Stephen Bradshaw, a Post Office investigator involved in some of the most prominent miscarriage of justice cases. He is a relatively minor figure in the affair – he was not an executive, or a key decision-maker - and in other circumstances his evidence might have gone unreported. But he led the news bulletins today because this was the first day of evidence since the ITV drama turbocharged public fury about the case, and people watching the hearing got to learn what the frontline perpetrators of the scandal were like. Bradshaw, who still works for the Post Office, came across as a heartless functionary. He showed little or no sympathy for the employees he prosecuted and who are now shown to have been innocent, and he dismissed suggestions that he should have taken more seriously the multiple complaints he encountered about the Horizon IT system. “I’m not technically minded,” he said, stressing he had been assured the IT system was reliable. Although he was personally in charge of some prosecutions, he repeatedly claimed that responsibility for dubious Post Office tactics – including the withholding of evidence about the reliability of Horizon from defence counsel (see 2.42pm), and using implied threats to get people to plead guilty (see 4.14pm) or to withdraw their allegations about Horizon (see 3.33pm) – lay with the lawyers, not with him. Despite being offered several chances to show some contrition, or to express sympathy for the victims, he declined (see 10.22am and 2.42pm). “I’m a small cog in this,” he said at one point. And a rather unappealing one too, many viewers will have concluded.   Patients are facing “unacceptably long” waits for care, health experts have said, as figures show the NHS going backwards on some of its key targets.   Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, is calling for an “honest” debate about Brexit in a speech citing new research saying it has made the UK economy £140bn smaller than it otherwise would have been. (See 4.10pm.)   Unlicensed XL bully dogs will be banned in Scotland, Humza Yousaf has said, as the Scottish government moves to replicate the new restrictions in England and Wales that have resulted in an apparent influx of the breed to Scotland.   Updated at 6.03pm GMT    5.03pm GMT   Near the end of his evidence session, Stephen Bradshaw, the Post Office investigator, was asked about a claim from Rita Threlfall, a branch manager he investigated. In a statement read out to the inquiry Threlfall, who uses a wheelchair, said:  Upon arrival, they left my husband and me in a hallway. We asked for a chair and never received one. I ended up having to sit down on the stairs. The interview room was up the stairs. I told them there was no way I could make it up the stairs. In order to make it to the interview room, I was placed in a tiny parcel lift.  Bradshaw said this was not true. He told the inquiry:  I can only keep repeating that it is not a small parcel lift. It is wheelchair accessible.   Updated at 5.43pm GMT    4.59pm GMT   No 10 has said Rishi Sunak will not be attending the World Economic Forum at Davos next week. A spokersperson said:  The PM will not be attending the World Economic Forum, but the UK government will be represented by senior government ministers. They will be championing priority growth sectors in the UK to the global business community and leveraging private sector investment on UK strategic foreign policy goals.      4.43pm GMT   At the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry the final lawyer to question Stephen Bradshaw was Christopher Jacobs, representing another group of post office operators. He challenged Bradshaw over a document relating to one prosecution in 2010 where Bradshaw said he wanted the prosecution to go ahead because “the integrity of the Horizon system was in question”. Jacobs said this showed that Bradshaw was actively trying to discredit the campaign by post office operators at the time who were arguing the Horizon system was flawed and leading to miscarriages of justice. Bradshaw said this was another example of “flamboyant” language. (He used the term earlier – see 11.57am.) The hearing has now ended.  Updated at 5.43pm GMT    4.27pm GMT  Bradshaw accepts Post Office's investigations department 'drenched in information' about complaints with Horizon  Edward Henry KC asked Stephen Bradshaw to confirm that his department was “drenched in information” about complaints with Horizon. He said:  Mr Bradshaw, contrary to what you say, you and your department, the security department, were drenched in information that Horizon wasn’t working from the very beginning.  Bradshaw replied: “The information came through, yes.” And Henry continued:  That information came from scores and scores, and ultimately hundreds and hundreds, of innocent subpostmasters who were suffering an epidemic of shortfalls.  Bradshaw replied: “Yes.”  Updated at 4.33pm GMT    4.22pm GMT    Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.14pm GMT  Post Office used threats of theft charges as 'nasty crowbar' to get people to plead guilty to false accounting, KC claims at inquiry  Back at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, Stephen Bradshaw, the former Post Office investigator, is now being questioned by counsel for core participants. Edward Henry KC, who is representing some sub-post office operatives, put it to Bradshaw that people were accused of theft, even when there was no evidence for that, as a tactic to get them to plead guilty to false accounting. He said the Post Office was using theft as “a nasty jemmy or crowbar to leverage pleas to false accounting”. Bradshaw said those were matters for the lawyers.  Updated at 4.21pm GMT    4.01pm GMT  Sadiq Khan calls for 'honest' debate about Brexit, publishing research saying it has made UK economy £140bn smaller  Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, will call for an “honest” debate about Brexit in a speech tonight in which he will highlight new research claiming the average Briton was nearly £2,000 worse off last year because the UK is no longer in the EU. And Khan will say that the report from Cambridge Econometrics shows the average Londoner is nearly £3,400 worse off. The report argues that the UK economy is £140bn smaller than it otherwise would have been, and London’s economy £30bn smaller than it would have been, because of Brexit. Khan will set out his case in his speech to the Mansion House dinner tonight. In a news release with advance quotes, Khan says:  Rather than dodging and ducking this issue, it’s incumbent on all of us to have an honest and mature discussion about the best way forward. It’s now obvious that Brexit isn’t working. The hard-line version of Brexit we’ve ended up with is dragging our economy down and pushing up the cost of living. It’s making food more expensive, adding to the acute pressures on households and having an ongoing detrimental impact on industries that are crucial to our success – such as hospitality, construction and financial services. I’d rather not be talking about Brexit again. But part of being the mayor of London is about standing up for our city. We’ve got to be frank – Brexit is simply not a peripheral concern that we can leave in the past – it’s a key contributor to the cost-of-living crisis right now and it’s resulting in lost opportunities, lost business and lost income at a time when people and companies can least afford it.  Khan says he agrees with David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, who has said that Labour wants a closer relationship with the EU. But his call for an “honest and mature” discussion about Brexit is unlikely to be welcomed by Kair Starmer, who wants more leave voters to support Labour and who says little in public about Brexit, which he is treating as a settled issue. The Cambridge Econometrics report is an update of an analysis carried out previously. It has calculated the cost of Brexit by modelling what is likely to happen to the economy as it is now against what might have happened if the UK had stayed in the EU (the counterfactual). Here is the key table.  Updated at 5.49pm GMT    3.33pm GMT  Post Office only agreed to accept reduced charges in some cases if accused accepted 'nothing wrong' with Horizon, inquiry told  Back at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, asks about another prosecution of a post officer operator. He shows the inquiry a document showing the Post Office indicated that it would accept a guilty plea on a less serious charge provided the defendant agreed to accept that there was “nothing wrong with Horizon”. Blake asks if this was acceptable. Stephen Bradshaw, the Post Office investigator giving evidence, at first avoids the question, saying this may reflect what had been said earlier. Sir Wyn Williams, the chair, says it’s a simple question. Was it appropriate? Bradshaw replies: “Probably not.” When Blake presses Bradshaw on this, he appears to retract at a little. It would not be acceptable “with today’s knowledge”, Bradshaw says. Q: What about the knowledge you had then? Bradshaw says that is the way cases happened then. The instructions came from solicitors. Blake says there is evidence of this approach in two cases. Whose idea was it? Not mine, says Bradshaw. Q: Was this coming from the Post Office? Bradshaw says the lawyers took the key decisions. He says those decisions were made “at a higher level than me”.  Updated at 3.44pm GMT    2.52pm GMT  Yousaf says Scotland will 'in essence replicate' England's ban on having XL bully dogs without licence  Humza Yousaf has said the Scottish government will “in essence replicate” UK legislation banning XL bully dogs without a licence, PA Media reports. Speaking in the Scottish parliament the first minister said: In England and Wales strict rules on the dogs came into force at the start of the month and Yousaf told MSPs:  What has become clear, I’m afraid in the last few weeks, is we have seen a flow of XL bully dogs coming to Scotland, a number of people coming to Scotland to bring XL bully dogs here to the country. As such, we will give further details to members of the Scottish Parliament through a parliamentary statement if the parliamentary bureau agrees next week. We will, in essence, replicate the legislation that is in England and Wales here in Scotland because ultimately, although we do have a very good system of dog control notice schemes … we have to respond to the situation as it currently stands and therefore we will do what we need to do to ensure public safety.  Yousaf stressed that he was not proposing a complete ban.  Updated at 3.17pm GMT    2.42pm GMT  Bradshaw declines to express regret about Horizon reliability evidence being withheld from defence in false accounting case  Back at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, Stephen Bradshaw, a Post Office investigator, is now being asked about a case involving Angela Sefton and Anne Nield. They were convicted of false accounting in 2013 but cleared a decade later. Bradshaw was the investigator. Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, asks about a description of the women facing investigators at the post offfice. It says there were tears. Bradshaw says he does not remember there being tears. He says the women “didn’t seem particularly upset”. He claims his inquiry in this case was about money not being deposited. He argues that this was not a Horizon problem. Blake puts it to him that problems with the Horizon system were the underlying cause of what went wrong. Bradshaw disputes this. Blake reads extracts from the defence’s case in Sefton’s trial. These show that the defence did make problems with Horizon an issue. He also shows an extract from the defence statement in Neild’s case, and he says both show that problems with the Horizon were central to their defence. He says these claims show why evidence relating to the unreliability of Horizon should have been disclosed in the case. Bradshaw continues to insist that the case wasn’t mainly about Horizon. It was about deposits not being credited with an account. Horizon was a “secondary issue”, he says. He also argues that what was relevant was ultimately a matter for the lawyers. He was there to gather evidence, he says. Blake shows a letter showing the Post Office’s lawyers decided not to disclose material relating to concerns about Horizon. Asked if he agreed with this, Bradshaw says it was not a matter for him. He says he thought you should disclose what you have, but it was a matter for the lawyers. Q: But you are the prosecuting authority? Bradshaw says he was not the prosecuting authority. He says he gathered information and handed it to the lawyers. Q: Do you have any further reflections on this? Bradshaw says this case was primarily about the suppression of cash deposit slips. Q: So we can take it you have no further reflections on this? Bradshaw replies: “If you wish to take it that way, yes.”  Updated at 2.53pm GMT    2.12pm GMT   Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has issued a statement about the hospital waiting figures focusing in particular on the increase in the number of people waiting more than 18 months. (See 10.51am.) He said:  It’s deeply concerning to see rising numbers of patients waiting more than 18 months for treatment. Rishi Sunak promised to eliminate the longest waits by last summer, yet more and more patients are having to put their lives on hold for unacceptable lengths of time. The last Labour government cut waiting lists from 18 months to 18 weeks. We did it before and we will do it again.       2.06pm GMT  Labour MP Tony Lloyd says he is ill with 'aggressive and untreatable leukaemia'  The Labour MP Tony Lloyd has released a statement saying he is ill with an aggressive and untreatable form of leukaemia. He says:  I have been receiving treatment for some time for a form of blood cancer which has been controlled by chemotherapy. Unfortunately this has now transformed into an aggressive and untreatable form of leukaemia and I will be leaving hospital today to spend the time I have left with my family.  He has asked for privacy. Lloyd, 73, was first elected to parliament in 1983. He was a Foreign Office minister for two years under Tony Blair and left the Commons to serve as Greater Manchester’s police commissioner in 2012. In 2017 he returned to the Commons as MP for Rochdale.  Updated at 2.14pm GMT    1.23pm GMT  No 10 says NHS waiting lists still 'far too high' but strikes having 'significant impact'  At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson said waiting lists were “still far too high” but argued that strikes were partly responsible. The spokesperson said:  Undoubtedly the strikes are having a significant impact on patient care, it forces those staff – the majority of staff who are not striking – to have to cover for junior doctors and that has a knock-on effect on patients. We have seen that with the number of cancelled operations. It’s unacceptable, it’s not fair to patients, it’s not fair to other NHS workers – the majority of whom are paid less than the average junior doctor.   Updated at 2.03pm GMT    1.17pm GMT  Humza Yousaf says he wants to work with UK government to ensure victims of Post Office Horizon scandal exonerated  At first minister’s questions in Edinburgh opposition leaders raised questions about the role of the Crown Office in the Horizon scandal, given that in Scotland, unlike elsewhere in the UK, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) had sole responsibility for prosecuting Horizon cases. The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, called for the lord advocate to make a statement to MSPs after the BBC revealed that the Crown Office was first informed of possible issues with Horizon in May 2013. Humza Yousaf, the first minister, responded that he had been told the Crown Office at that point provided guidance to courts to treat cases on evidence that did not rely on Horizon, meaning that after that the Crown Office would not prosecute solely on Horizon evidence. Yousaf also re-iterated his pledge that everyone convicted in Scotland as part of the scandal would be cleared. He wrote to Rishi Sunak yesterday evening, saying that he wanted to work with the UK government to ensure victims across the UK were exonerated. Usually a law such as the one proposed by Sunak to quash the convictions would not have effect in Scotland, but Yousaf has indicated that a legislative consent motion approved in the Scottish parliament would be the quickest way of ensuring that it did apply north of the border. He said that the process was “complex” but that his government would work “urgently” to ensure sub-postmasters did not have to wait for a moment longer for justice.  Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.10pm GMT   Back at the inquiry Stephen Bradshaw is now being asked about the prosecution of Khayyam Ishaq, a post office operator. Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, asks Bradshaw about the prosecution case. It included the prosection asserting that there was “no fault in the [Horizon] system at all”. Asked if he was happy about that claim, Bradshaw says that that was the claim being stated by the lawyers. Blake puts it to him that this was 2013, and that at this point Bradshaw was aware of allegations about problems with the Horizon system. Bradshaw says he was not in court for the prosecution’s opening statement because he was a witness. The hearing breaks for lunch.     12.58pm GMT  NHS England waiting list higher than at time Sunak made pledge to reduce it, figures show  The NHS England waiting list is still higher than it was at the time Rishi Sunak pledged to reduce it, data shows, PA Media reports. PA says:  In January 2023, the prime minister made cutting the waiting list a key priority for the year, saying: “NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly”. However the figures show that despite recent dips in the waiting list, it is still higher than when the pledge was made. The waiting list stood at 7.21m treatments waiting to be carried out in January 2023. As of November, some 7.61 treatments were waiting to be carried out. The analysis shows there would need to be a drop of 400,000 in the December 2023 data (not yet published) to return the waiting list to what it was when the pledge was made. This is four times the drop of 100,000 between October and November.   Updated at 1.03pm GMT    12.53pm GMT  Bradshaw says he's 'small cog' as he suggests lawyers to blame for evidence about Horizon flaws not being disclosed  Back at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, Stephen Bradshaw, the Post Office investigator, is being asked about a trial where the defence asked for the disclosure of evidence about wider problems with the Horizon system. Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, highlights various documents showing that Bradshaw was asked for information but gave little or nothing in response. Bradshaw repeatedly says that he relied on the Post Office’s lawyers to decide what should be disclosed. “I’m a small cog in this,” he says. Asked if he ever had concerns when he realised the lawyers were refusing to hand over more documentation about wider problems with the Horizon system, Bradshaw says he cannot remember what was said. But he repeats the point about how he viewed this as an issue for the lawyers, even though he was the disclosure officer in the case.  Updated at 1.03pm GMT    12.36pm GMT  Waiting list figures show Sunak can't claim blame strikes for hospital performance, says RCN  The Royal College of Nursing says today’s hospital waiting figures (see 9.48am) show the PM cannot just blame NHS strikes for long waiting lists. In a statement Pat Cullen, the RCN general secretary, said:  The NHS waiting list remains extraordinarily high and the UK government only has itself to blame. It’s been over a year since the prime minister pledged to bring down the waiting list, yet it remains 400,000 higher than when he made his promise. The prime minister can’t pull the wool over people’s eyes by claiming it is down to strike action. He needs to start listening to nursing staff who have been calling for investment in the workforce, including fair pay.   Updated at 12.46pm GMT    12.33pm GMT   Under the government’s Post Office Horizon plan announced yesterday, as well as legislation to quash wrongful convictions, there will also be a new compensation offer of £75,000. This is for members of the “group litigation cohort”, post office operators who were not convicted but who were wrongly forced to “hand back” money that the Horizon IT system was missing. This group has been instrumental in exposing the miscarriage of justice. Members of this group can either accept £75,000 upfront or, if they believe they are entitled to more, seek specific compensation under a process already in place. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson said the government expected most people in this group would not accept the upfront payments. He said:  It’s worth emphasising that this is an upfront offer. We would estimate that around a third of individuals would take that. For those that are more significantly impacted, perhaps they had to use significantly more of their life savings or whatever it might be, they are able to seek a higher offer. And our aim is to resolve that by the summer. We recognise that there will be a significant number for whom £75,000 is not sufficient. That’s entirely understandable.  The spokesperson also did not rule out further legislation once the inquiry is over.  Updated at 12.52pm GMT    12.18pm GMT   Labour has posted a summary of its child health action plan on its website. Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting have been formally launching it in Liverpool this morning.  Updated at 12.33pm GMT    12.11pm GMT   Back at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry Stephen Bradshaw is being asked about what he did to establish that the computer system was working properly. Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, shows an extract from a report by Bradshaw into a particular inquiry where Bradshaw said he was not aware of any problems with Horizon’s “product integrity”. And Blake brings up this extract from Bradshaw’s witness statement, where he implies it was not for him to question the integrity of the Horizon system. Blake questions why Bradshaw was not more sceptical of Horizon, given that by this point doubts about the system were being raised. Bradshaw says in the investigation referred to, Horizon was not the issue.  Updated at 12.16pm GMT    12.01pm GMT   In the Commons this morning Penny Mordaunt, leader of the house, told MPs that the second reading of the government’s oil and gas bill would take place on Monday 22 January. It was meant to happen three days ago, but got postponed because other business overran.  Updated at 12.08pm GMT    11.57am GMT   In the inquiry hearing Stephen Bradshaw, the Post Office investigator, defended saying that he wanted a particular case to go to trial to defend the integrity of the Horizon IT system. Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, quoted from Bradshaw’s self-appraisal in the case of Jacqueline McDonald. (See 11.12am and 11.49am.) Bradshaw said:  The offender pleaded guilty to false accounting but would not accept theft. I challenged the recommendations of the barrister and persuaded him that a trial would be necessary, as the reason given by the defendant, Horizon integrity, would have a wider impact on the business if a trial did not go ahead.  Blake then asked:  It seems, certainly from your own feedback, from your own appraisal, that you saw it as in some way career-boosting to press on with Ms McDonald’s case because of problems with the Horizon system having a wider impact on the business. Do you not accept that?  Bradshaw replied:  The issue would been discussed with the prosecution barrister. As you’re well aware, when you’re filling in one-to-ones, there’s always a flamboyant way of putting the words across.  Bradshaw also denied suggestions that his bonuses were related to getting convictions in cases like this.  Updated at 4.44pm GMT    11.51am GMT       11.49am GMT  Post Office investigator made accused post office operator think she was only person with missing money, inquiry told  At the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry extracts were shown from a statement made by Jacqueline McDonald, who claimed she was “bullied” by Stephen Bradshaw during an investigation into her alleged £50,000 shortfall. In the statement, she said:  Shortly after I had been audited and my post office was taken away from me, I read an article in a magazine which highlighted other people who have suffered or [were] about to suffer the same hell I was going through. I then got in touch with the writer of the article who then put me in touch with the JFSA (Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance). This was a very big surprise to me as I was led to believe by the investigator for the POL Stephen Bradshaw that I was the only one in this position and this has never happened before. Stephen Bradshaw is a liar and he knew the whole time as I am friends with another person he has prosecuted that was a member of the JFSA. It is just unbelievable how I was made to feel like I was the only one and it made me isolated and paranoid.  Asked about this Bradshaw said: “I’ve never said that to her. That’s incorrect, that statement.”  Updated at 12.40pm GMT    11.40am GMT   This is from Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of the King’s Fund, the health thinktank, on today’s NHS England performance figures.  These figures show that the NHS is still not meeting the majority of its most important performance targets this winter. On some measures the situation is better than this time last year, in part thanks to efforts to increase capacity as well as relatively low hospital admissions from Covid-19 and flu, but patients are still not receiving an acceptable level of service … With the waiting list for routine care at 7.6 million, it is increasingly unlikely that the prime minister’s pledge to improve waiting-list performance by this March will be met.  NHS England has a target of getting rid of hospital waits of more than 65 weeks by March 2024, and waits of more than a year by March 2025. It was supposed to have eliminated 18-month waits by April 2023.  Updated at 2.58pm GMT    11.31am GMT   This is from John Hyde from the Law Society Gazette who (unlike many of us) started following Post Office Horizon IT inquiry hearings long before the ITV drama catapulted the scandal to the top of the Westminster news agenda.  Seen a lot of tweets from people saying Post Office investigator Stephen Bradshaw is coming across as incompetent and/or blindly defending the PO.For those of us who have covered the inquiry before, let me tell you this is nothing new   Seen a lot of tweets from people saying Post Office investigator Stephen Bradshaw is coming across as incompetent and/or blindly defending the PO.For those of us who have covered the inquiry before, let me tell you this is nothing new. #PostOfficeScandal— John Hyde (@JohnHyde1982) January 11, 2024      11.18am GMT   At the inquiry hearing Julian Blake is now asking Stephen Bradshaw about his use of aggressive language in the Jacqueline McDonald investigation. (See 11.12am.) This included his suggesting she was telling “a pack of lies”. Bradshaw repeats the point he made earlier about how these were Pace (Police and Criminal Evidence Act) interviews. (See 10.56am.) They were not intended to be nice, he says. He says he normally warned people in advance that he needed to ask tough questions, but that it was not personal. UPDATE: PA Media has more on this exchange.  Jacqueline McDonald claimed she was “bullied” by Bradshaw during an investigation into her alleged £50,000 shortfall and also accused Post Office investigators of “behaving like Mafia gangsters”. The inquiry heard extracts of an interview Bradshaw conducted with McDonald. Bradshaw asked her to tell him what happened to the money, to which the subpostmistress said: “I don’t know where the money is, I’ve told you.” He responded: “You have told me a pack of lies.” McDonald said: “No I haven’t told you a pack of lies because I haven’t stolen a penny.”   Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.12am GMT  Post Office investigator denies acting like 'mafia gangster' with post office operators in evidence to inquiry  Here is the full text of the witness statement that Stephen Bradshaw has given to the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry. And this is what PA Media has filed based on what it says.  A Post Office investigator has denied claims he and others “behaved like Mafia gangsters” who were looking to collect “bounty with the threats and lies” from subpostmasters. Stephen Bradshaw, who has been employed at the Post Office since 1978, submitted a witness statement to the Horizon IT inquiry in which he said: “I refute the allegation that I am a liar.” He told the inquiry he was not “technically minded” and was not equipped to know whether there were bugs or errors in the Horizon system. The witness began giving evidence this morning after being involved in the criminal investigation of nine sub-post office operators, including Lisa Brennan, a former counter clerk at a post office in Huyton, near Liverpool, who was falsely accused of stealing £3,000 in 2003. Bradshaw has also been accused by fellow Merseyside subpostmistress Rita Threlfall of asking her for the colour of her eyes and what jewellery she wore before saying: “Good, so we’ve got a description of you for when they come”, during her interview under caution in August 2010. Another sub-post office operator, Jacqueline McDonald, claimed she was “bullied” by Bradshaw during an investigation into her alleged £50,000 shortfall. Responding to McDonald’s claims in his statement, the witness said: “I refute the allegation that I am a liar. “I also refute the claim that Jacqueline McDonald was bullied, from the moment we arrived, the auditor was already on site, conversations were initially (held) with Mr McDonald, the reason for our attendance was explained, Mr and Mrs McDonald were kept updated as the day progressed.” The investigator added: “Ms Jacqueline McDonald is also incorrect in stating Post Office investigators behaved like Mafia gangsters looking to collect their bounty with the threats and lies.” Throughout his witness statement, Bradshaw said his investigations had been conducted in a “professional” manner.   Updated at 11.12am GMT    10.56am GMT   Blake quotes an extract from Bradshaw’s witness statement where he says he never told a Post Office suspect that they were the only person experiencing the sort of money disappearance problem being investigated. He quotes from the transcript of an interview attended by Bradshaw and another investigator where the second investigator told the woman being interviewed no one else was having those problems. He points out that Bradshaw did not query that. Bradshaw says that comment meant no one else in that branch was having that problems. It was not a statement about no one else in the entire Post Office network having that problems. Bradshaw says it was a Pace (Police and Criminal Evidence Act) interview. The questions were meant to be difficult, he says. He says he regards the interview as professional     10.51am GMT  More than 11,000 people still waiting more than 18 months for hospital treatment in England, figures show  Rishi Sunak said he wanted NHS England to eliminate all hospital waits lasting more than 18 months – apart from exceptionally complicated cases, or cases where patients are happy to wait. As PA Media reports, today’s figures show that 11,168 people were estimated waiting more than 18 months at the end of November 2023, up from 10,506 at the end of October. Today’s figures also show that 355,412 people in England had been waiting more than a year for hospital treatment at the end of November 2023, down from 377,618 at the end of October, PA says. The government has a target of eliminating all waits of more than a year by March 2025.     10.44am GMT   At the inquiry Blake points out that some of what was in a previous witness statement from Bradshaw was drafted by the PR department at the Post Office. Bradshaw says he did not know that. As far as he was aware, he says, the draft came from the lawywers.  Updated at 11.01am GMT    10.35am GMT   Back at the Post Office inquiry Julian Blake says Stephen Bradshaw, the Post Office investigator, seems to show a “lack of reflection” on his role in miscarriage of justice events in a witness statement he supplied. Bradshaw says he has reflected on what he said in his statement, because some of what he said was “completely wrong”. But he says he was told what he should say by lawyers. UPDATE: PA Media has more on these exchanges.  Stephen Bradshaw, who was an investigation manager for the Post Office, said a statement signed by him declaring the Post Office’s “absolute confidence” in the Horizon IT system was written by lawyers. A statement signed by Bradshaw in November 2012 said: “The Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system.” Bradshaw earlier told the inquiry he was not “technically minded” and was not equipped to know whether there were bugs or errors in the Horizon system. Asked if it was appropriate for him to declare “confidence” in the IT system in the 2012 statement, he said: “I was given that statement by Cartwright King [a law firm] and told to put that statement through. In hindsight … there probably should have been another line stating, ‘These are not my words’.”   Updated at 11.20am GMT    10.31am GMT  13% of ambulance handovers at hospitals in England delayed more than hour, figures show  The NHS England figures out today show the performance of the ambulance service getting worse. PA Media has summarised the main points.  The average response time in December for ambulances in England dealing with the most urgent incidents, defined as calls from people with life-threatening illnesses or injuries, was 8min 44sec, PA says. This is up from 8min 32sec in November and is above the target standard response time of seven minutes.   Ambulances took an average of 45min 57sec last month to respond to emergency calls such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis, PA says. This is up from 38min 30sec in November, while the target is 18min.   Response times for urgent calls, such as late stages of labour, non-severe burns and diabetes, averaged 2hr 37min 5sec in December, up from 2hr 16min 47secin November, PA says.   Some 13% of ambulance handovers in England last week, or 12,225 patients, were delayed by more than an hour, PA says. This was up from 12% a week earlier, but is below this winter’s current peak of 15%, recorded in the week to 10 December.   Nearly one in three patients arriving by ambulance at hospitals in England last week waited more than 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E teams, PA says. Some 28,189 delays of half an hour or longer were recorded across all hospital trusts in the week to 7 January. This was 31% of the 91,234 arrivals by ambulance, where the handover time was known. The figure is up from 29% in the previous week, but is not the highest so far this winter, which was 34% in the week ending 10 December, PA says.   Updated at 10.44am GMT    10.22am GMT  Post Office investigator tells inquiry he was not told of problems with Horizon IT system  Blake runs through Bradshaw’s witness statement, and highlight passages where, in relation to various investigations, he said he had no concerns about what happened. He asks Bradshaw if, over the past 20 years, he has given any thought to his role in a miscarriage of justice. Bradshaw says he was not told about any problems with the Horizon system. The investigations were carried out correctly.     10.16am GMT  Labour to focus on ‘blue wall’ seats as it kicks off byelection drive  Labour is to kick off campaigning in a string of upcoming byelections by highlighting increased mortgage costs in so-called blue wall constituencies, in a tactical shift in which the party will openly target Conservative-held seats coveted by the Liberal Democrats, Peter Walker reports.   Related: Labour to focus on ‘blue wall’ seats as it kicks off byelection drive       10.15am GMT   Stephen Bradshaw is sworn in. Sir Wyn Williams says Bradshaw has the right not to answer a question if he thinks it will incriminate him. He says Bradshaw can consult his lawyers if he needs advice on this. Bradshaw is now being questioned by Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry. Bradshaw says he was employed by the Post Office from 1978. He says he has been involved in investigations since 2000 and is currently a security manager.  Updated at 11.20am GMT    10.07am GMT   Sir Wyn Williams, chair of the inquiry, is opening the proceedings now. He starts by giving details of future hearings. But he says some of the timings depend on how quickly material is disclosed by the Post Office. He says his wife was “extremely alarmed” to hear a report saying phase six would not start until the spring of next year. He says his intention is that it should start long before then. But says he has been bad at predicting timings. But doing a thorough job is more important than “a few months here or there”, he says.  Updated at 10.14am GMT    10.04am GMT  Post Office Horizon inquiry takes evidence from former investigator  The Post Office Horizon IT inquiry is taking evidence this morning. The inquiry was set up in 2020, and upgraded to a statutory inquiry a year later, and has been holding public hearings for almost two years. But the scandal is now getting much more media attention than before as a direct result of the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office broadcast after Christmas. The witness giving evidence today is Stephen Bradshaw, a former Post Office investigator. Describing his role, PA Media says:  Bradshaw has also been accused by fellow Merseyside subpostmistress Rita Threlfall of asking her for the colour of her eyes and what jewellery she wore before saying: “Good, so we’ve got a description of you for when they come” during her interview under caution in August 2010. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Jason Beer KC, previously described Bradshaw as having a “heavy footprint” in the scandal. His evidence will form part of phase four of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry which began in July last year and is looking at the action that was taken against subpostmasters including audits, investigations and criminal proceedings.      Updated at 11.20am GMT    9.52am GMT   In the Commons the government has moved the writs for the bylections in Wellinborough, where Peter Bone had a majority of 18,540 in 2019, and in Kingswood, where Chris Skidmore’s majority was 11,220. They are both expected to take place on Thursday 15 February.  Updated at 9.56am GMT    9.48am GMT  NHS England hospital waiting list falls slightly for second month in row to 7.61m  The waiting list for hospital treatment in England has fallen for the second month in a row, figures from NHS England out this morning show. As PA Media reports, an estimated 7.61m treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of November, relating to 6.39 million patients, down from 7.71m treatments and 6.44 million patients at the end of October, NHS England said. This chart, from the NHS England news release, shows how the waiting list has soared over the past decade. And this table shows what treatments people are waiting for.  Updated at 9.57am GMT    9.18am GMT  Labour promises to end ‘scandal of plummeting child health outcomes’  Good morning. Keir Starmer will today start a series of fortnightly visits around Britain intended to promote Labour’s “missions”, and today he is in the north-west of England launching the party’s child health action plan. He has written about the proposals for the Guardian here.   Related: Britain has suffered terribly under these Tories, especially our children. The only word for it is neglect | Keir Starmer   As Pippa Crerar explains in her report, Starmer is not afraid of claims that measures like supervised teeth brushing for three to five-year-olds in nursery are “nanny state”. Starmer says:  I know that we need to take on this question of the nanny state. The moment you do anything on child health, people say ‘you’re going down the road of the nanny state.’ We want to have that fight.    Related: Starmer to embrace ‘nanny state’ with plan for toothbrushing in schools   Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, was on the Today programme this morning speaking about the plans and he said he was shocked by the evidence showing the extent to which the health and wellbeing of the nation’s children has declined. He said, compared to their international peers, children were getting shorter under the Tories.  At the heart of all of the policies we’re we’re announcing today is a focus on prevention, promoting good health amongst kids, and making sure that we arrest this decline in our country. When you look at the OECD tables, and you look at the height of children, which is an indicator of their health, their nutrition and their exercise, we’re slipping down the international rankings for boys and girls. We are literally not standing as tall as we did on the world stage. And I think this is embarrassing.  And in its news release Labour says:  British children today are smaller than Haitian children, fatter than the French, and less happy than the Turks. The height of the average British five-year old girl has fallen by 27 places in international rankings over the last three decades, with the average British five-year-old boy has fallen by 33 places on the height league table.  Here is a chart from an ITV report that illustrates the point. Labour says it wants to “end the scandal of plummeting child health outcomes” and produce “the healthiest and happiest generation of children ever in Britain”. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: NHS England publishes its monthly performance figures. Morning: Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, are on a visit in the north-west of England to promote Labour’s health missions. They are both doing media interviews. 10am: The Post Office Horizon IT inquiry resumes for the first time since the ITV drama ignited public outrage about the scandal. Stephen Bradshaw, a former Post Office investigator, is giving evidence. After 10.30am: Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement on next week’s business in the chamber. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.

        "content": "Rishi Sunak is planning a general election on 14 November, according to the former chancellor George Osborne, as the prime minister looks to maximise the amount of time he has to recover the Conservatives’ poll deficit before polling day.\nSpeaking on Political Currency, the podcast he hosts with the former Labour cabinet minister Ed Balls, Osborne said he had been told Sunak’s team were working towards the date in mid-November as the target for an election.\nSunak has said his “working assumption” is that he will hold the vote in the second half of the year, while Conservative sources say a final decision has not yet been taken over a date.\nOsborne, who is close to many of those around Sunak, told the podcast: “A little birdie has told me that the various work programmes required to get ready for a general election have that date singled out – 14 November.\n“By the way, logic leads you there because you’re not going to have it in the first half of the year. I mean, this pretence that Rishi Sunak could have a May election was something we discussed last year. It’s a non-starter. He’s more than 20 points behind in the opinion polls. He’s not going to have a spring election.\nHe added: “So then you’re left with the autumn. And you’re probably thinking: ‘I know, we’ll have the party conference as a kind of launch pad. We’ll fit in an autumn statement, like a mini-budget, either before that or immediately after it.’ And that kind of leads you into mid-November. So 14 November kind of writes itself.”\nSunak has until January 2025 to hold an election, and Labour politicians had speculated that he would do so in May this year. Earlier this month however the prime minister clarified that he was thinking of a date in the second half of the year.\nHe told broadcasters during a visit to Nottingham: “My working assumption is we’ll have a general election in the second half of this year and in the meantime I’ve got lots that I want to get on with.”\nTory sources do not deny they have an election date in mind, but say they are retaining the flexibility to move it if needed.\nAn election on 14 November would mean Sunak announcing it at or around the Conservative party conference in early October. It would also mean the second general election in a row which has been fought in the colder months.\nWith the Conservatives 18 points behind in the polls, many of their strategists believe they should leave it as late as possible to call an election to give the economy and public services time to recover. The Bank of England now forecasts inflation to fall to 2% by April, while Sunak says he thinks NHS waiting lists will begin falling in a sustained way this spring.\nOsborne said Sunak had made a mistake in the first few weeks of the year, however, by focusing on immigration rather than the economy. “I was listening at home, I was thinking: why are you going on about immigration and asylum seekers and Rwanda again? That’s how we ended last year, and it’s a mess.\n“I’m not saying immigration’s not a very important issue, but let’s be honest, it’s not like the public think that the Conservatives have got a grip on it at the moment. You should be talking about the economy.”"

        "content": "Labour should stick to its £28bn climate spending plans, Chris Skidmore has said days after quitting as a Conservative MP over Rishi Sunak’s climate stance. Speaking to the Guardian, the former minister who was tasked with writing a review of the government’s net zero plans, said he supported the pledge despite being a “fiscal conservative”. The Conservatives have been increasing their attacks on Labour over the proposal but Skidmore, who quit the party last week, said: “That investment is needed. It will end up having to be invested. The longer we wait, this investment for net zero is going to cost far more than £28bn.”   Related: Conservative party heading in ‘very dark direction’, says former minister   Labour promised in 2021 to invest £28bn a year in green projects until 2030 if it came to power. But last year the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said it would instead be a target to work towards in the second half of a first parliament, should the party win the next general election. The former MP for Kingswood, where there will be a byelection in February, said: “Labour has set out a real mission on climate. I’m probably very closely aligned with them on that,” adding that this showed “party politics means that not everyone fits into that sort of neat box”.   Related: Chris Skidmore resigns Conservative whip over Sunak’s oil and gas licence plan   Despite believing in generally lower state spending, Skidmore said investment in technology, and net zero, was important. He said: “We are living in remarkable revolutionary times, where new technologies are emerging. And the countries that move first are the ones that get that first-mover advantage. “There is no free ride here. In the past, when we failed to invest in offshore wind, all the jobs or the industries went abroad. We failed to capitalise on that initial first lead. We failed to capitalise on nuclear in the past as well again; it all went to France. The jobs went elsewhere. I can see, as a historian, history repeating itself.” Since his shock resignation last Friday over the government’s upcoming oil and gas licensing bill, Skidmore has faced attacks from his former colleagues, some of whom have said he is selfish for causing a byelection so close to a general election. He said he has felt “up and down” since quitting, and “sorry that he’s upset people”. For the first time since 1996, when he joined the Conservative party, Skidmore is no longer a Tory and it has led to an identity crisis. “I was 28 when I got elected,” he said, “I didn’t expect to get elected and now I’m 42. John Lennon once said: ‘We gave the best part of our 20s to the Beatles.’ I gave my late 20s and my 30s to the Conservative party, and I fully appreciate it’s given me a fantastic opportunity and I don’t deny that.” No longer being an MP will be strange for Skidmore: “Obviously there is an identity with having MP attached to your name and that no longer being there – it is obviously probably too soon to know how it will feel. “But I think obviously, I prepared myself in knowing both obviously my seat was abolished at the next general election, that it was coming to an end – it obviously has come to an end sooner than I’d hoped.” He added that he was trying to hold out until May but in the end couldn’t stomach being in a party that argued “black is white” over fossil fuels and climate breakdown. “It’s strange to lose that identity and try to find another identity,” he added. “I think I’ve done the right thing, and I feel content with what I’ve done. But obviously, you know, that is now a chapter of my life that’s closed, I guess.” Skidmore previously told the Guardian that the Tories were “headed in a very dark direction” over misinformation and climate change. He also was the ringleader of the rebellion over the fracking vote, which is often cited as the straw that broke the camel’s back for Liz Truss’s premiership. So he has been at odds with his party for some time, ever since the party turned its back on climate action. He reached the point last week where he couldn’t continue fighting from within: “That’s the challenge, isn’t it? Do you work from within or is there a point where you know that that’s not working? And I have consistently voted against the party. I didn’t vote for the king’s speech. There was a point probably where the whip would have been taken away from me. He added that he was also “getting in trouble with the party” for his work with Sadiq Khan on green issues. Sunak is about to face a rebellion from the right on his Rwanda plans. Skidmore sees a double standard when his colleagues can vocally oppose the Rwanda scheme and not be chastised. “No one has made these loyalty arguments about colleagues focusing on opposing – very vocally – the prime minister on Rwanda. The more that obviously is spoken about immigration in strong culture war terms, it raises the salience of immigration, and it just lends votes to Reform [the former Brexit party]. The more that people talk about the failure in the Conservative party on immigration, the more that goes up in the polling issues and then people tend to vote for a more extreme party,” he added. The former minister thinks the Conservatives will lose the election partly because Sunak turned his back on net zero. He said there is a “silent majority” of Conservative voters who deeply believe in conserving the environment. He explained: “I’ve been contacted by hundreds of people across the country since resigning. People are saying: ‘I was a conservative. I care passionately about this and net zero’… they’ll be looking to vote elsewhere at this election. I think that will be the case across enough marginal constituencies in the election. I think the top 60 target seats are probably 3,000 votes and under, which means that the net zero and climate action will be a pivotal moment, which can swing the election.”"

        "content": "Labour is to kick off campaigning in a string of upcoming byelections by highlighting increased mortgage costs in so-called blue wall constituencies, in a tactical shift in which the party will openly target Conservative-held seats coveted by the Liberal Democrats. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is to visit Kingswood, the constituency vacated by Chris Skidmore, the Conservative who quit as an MP last week in protest at the government’s planned new rounds of oil and gas licences. Reeves will highlight a Labour analysis of rising mortgage costs in 42 constituencies identified as being in the blue wall, a Lib Dem-coined term for relatively affluent seats, generally Tory held and often in commuter belts around cities. On Reeves’s visit to Kingswood, just outside Bristol, she will say more than 100,000 households in the 42 constituencies will have mortgages that need renewing this year, with the bulk facing steep increases in payments. As well as highlighting the continued repercussions of the fiscal crisis sparked by Liz Truss’s brief time in government, the choice of blue wall constituencies for the analysis, including top Lib Dem targets such as Esher and Walton, Wimbledon and Winchester, shows a new Labour confidence that they can attract disaffected centrist Conservatives. A Labour source said last year’s Mid Bedfordshire byelection, where the party saw off a strong Lib Dem challenge to take the formerly firm Conservative seat, showed there were now “no no-go areas for us”. “In Mid Beds we could have rolled out the yellow carpet and told the Lib Dems: ‘We’ll leave you to it.’ But we fought them and won. It shows quite how far we have come in such areas since 2019. “The job for Rachel and Keir has been to convince voters they can trust us on the economy, that we take fiscal discipline seriously.” The mortgage analysis, based on data from the Bank of England and the House of Commons library, estimates that among 111,600 mortgages due for renewal in the 42 seats this year, 2,800 are in Kingswood. Labour said that while the average monthly repayment for families formerly on fixed-term mortgages had risen by £240, given higher average house prices in blue wall seats, for these areas the average could be nearer £385. While the date for the Kingswood byelection has not been finalised, it is expected in mid-February, most likely on the same day as one in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, triggered after enough local voters supported a recall petition for the sitting Tory MP, Peter Bone. This happened after Bone was suspended from parliament for six weeks after a watchdog found he had bullied a staff member and exposed his genitals near their face. Reeves said: “Homeowners across Britain, including many lifelong Tory voters, have been left worse off after 14 years of economic failure. “The aftershocks of the Conservatives’ disastrous mini-budget that crashed the economy and sent mortgage rates soaring continue to be felt for thousands of hard-pressed families.”"

        "content": "A senior Conservative MP launched a scathing attack on a controversial bill banning local councils from boycotting Israel, as eight Tories voted against the proposed legislation. Alicia Kearns, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee, told the Guardian that the bill undermined free speech, went against international law and risked leaving the UK isolated on the global stage. While the bill passed by 282 votes to 235, eight Conservative MPs voted against the legislation, which will cause some embarrassment to its chief supporter, Michael Gove. Kearns said: “This bill is flawed in four key areas: it breaks with our foreign policy; undermines freedom of speech; goes against international law; and promotes an odd exceptionalism in UK primary legislation. “We rely on the rules-based system to protect ourselves and to protect our allies and yet we are at risk of breaching UN security council resolution 2334, a resolution the UK was instrumental in drafting. “Legislation created by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities must not depart from our foreign policy, let alone undermine it or leave us ostracised internationally.” A spokesperson for Gove’s department said: “Public bodies imposing boycotts on foreign countries not only undermine the UK’s foreign policy but can also fuel division across our communities. This change delivers on the government’s manifesto, stopping public bodies from wasting taxpayers’ money pursuing their own foreign policy agendas and ensuring that the UK speaks with one voice internationally.” Kearns is one of the most prominent centrists within the Tory party. Kit Malthouse, a long-time ally of Boris Johnson, is also planning to rebel. But concern about ithe proposed legislation’s contents is also present on the right of the party. David Jones, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, is also planning to vote against the bill because of the status it grants to Israel. The bill is aimed at stopping public bodies across the UK from levying any kind of sanction regime against a government that is not also being placed under sanctions by the UK government. Two Labour-led councils said they would boycott goods from Israel in protest at the country’s policies towards the occupied Palestinian territories. However, several Conservative MPs have said they are opposed to the bill because of the way it explicitly names Israel as worthy of special protection, and appears to include the occupied territories as part of its definition of Israel. Crispin Blunt and William Wragg voted against the bill at second reading. A much bigger rebellion at the third reading would indicate that Tory whips have lost influence since then. Senior Conservatives had hoped the bill would help divide Labour over the sensitive issue of Israel and Palestine, torn between the natural support of many Labour MPs for the Palestinian cause and the party leader Keir Starmer’s desire not to allow any appearance of antisemitism. The bill’s report stage was held last October, just weeks after the Hamas attack on southern Israel, in what critics of the proposed legislation said was a political move designed to capitalise on the attack. Labour, however, confirmed on Wednesday morning it would whip MPs to vote against the bill. Wayne David, a shadow foreign office minister, wrote on the Labour List website: “The most damaging part of the bill is that it treats the occupied Palestinian territories as though they were in effect the same as the State of Israel. “This runs directly counter to decades of British diplomacy by Conservative and Labour governments alike, and it could not come at a worse time.”"

        "content": "As someone responsible for Labour’s catastrophic defeat in December 2019, which has enabled the Tories to inflict chaos on our society and harm on the most vulnerable people for the last four years, John McDonnell has some brass neck to be lecturing Keir Starmer on how to win an election. He began his article (Starmer must say what he’ll do in power – if he leaves a vacuum, the far right will fill it, 4 January) disingenuously, by insinuating that Labour’s current popularity over the Tories is “part of a natural cycle”, rather than what is in fact an astonishing comeback, due in no small measure to Starmer’s efforts to expose the Tories’ unfitness for government. It may escape McDonnell, but it would make sense to me if Starmer’s giving away “very little, or any, detail on what he will do in office” was a strategy to prevent the Tories from helping themselves to what they wanted from Labour’s policies while misrepresenting the remainder of them to the electorate via the front pages of the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph. Starmer admires Harold Wilson, who – within five years of being elected in 1964, after 13 years of Tory rule – abolished capital punishment and legalised both abortion and homosexuality, none of which had been in Labour’s election manifesto nor required lavish public spending, but helped to make our country kinder and more just. Personally, I credit Starmer for his impressive work so far and trust him to know how to win an election and use power once in office.Martin WallaceLondon • John McDonnell is spot-on about the far right filling the vacuum if Labour cannot deliver the change the country needs and expects. While it is understandable that Labour does not wish to give any hostages to fortune, it seems to have just submitted to the establishment and made it very hard for people who think about the political direction of this country to work out what its basic principles are. New Labour – pre-Iraq – was exciting, with some great ideas. The message of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves seems to be that Labour will implement Tory policies more competently. They are still allowing the Tories to set the agenda. A paler version of Tory policies by a new Labour government will end in disillusionment and failure, and open the door to the far-right fraudsters and racists who are on the rise in Europe.Aziz Rajab-AliLondon • There is little point in trying to second guess how the Conservative party sees its relationship from week to week with Reform UK and other far-right factions, but John McDonnell’s analysis deserves to be taken seriously, whatever his past political history and reputation within the Labour party. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens should have no problems with his warnings.  But if, on this occasion, McDonnell sounds like the voice of sanity then Labour – and, consequently, the rest of us – are in serious trouble. Majoring on telling Conservative and former Conservative voters that Labour is a changed party does not capture the imagination of millions of people who want leaders to stand firmly against extremist rightwing parties, and stop them getting anywhere near political power.Geoff ReidBradford • John McDonnell makes some important points. I will demur from pointing out that under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, McDonnell failed to convince the electorate that he could manage the economy, and the result was four further years of very rightwing policies and chaos. Starmer is correct to focus on getting into No 10 with a middle-of-the-road plan and a commitment to clean up politics. The electorate knows that it will take more than five years to correct the disasters of the previous 14 years.Tim SmartFleet, Hampshire  • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

        "content": "At times like these, we would do well to remember the real heroes in the whole sorry business. Not the little people – men and women such as Alan Bates and the other operators who have pursued the Post Office and Fujitsu relentlessly for the best part of 25 years. Nor the lawyers who fought their cases through the courts. But the MPs who have managed to convince themselves that they are the ones who have made the difference, without whom justice would still be denied.\nWe’re not talking of the few genuine MPs here. The former Conservative MP Lord Arbuthnot, who appeared rather bemused as he followed Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions and the subsequent urgent question from the gallery. Nor Labour’s Kevan Jones and Darren Jones, who have also tenaciously got stuck in. Rather we’re thinking of the vast majority who have only newly remembered just how much they always cared. The unsung legends of the Horizon scandal.\nTake Priti Patel. She had taken her place on the back row of the government benches ready to receive the undying gratitude of her colleagues. Since last week’s ITV drama, she has rather invented herself as the champion of the underdog. While it’s true she was one of the first to mention the miscarriage of justice in parliament back in 2010, she has gone rather quiet since. She never used her position as home secretary to the post office operators’ advantage and she did accept an invitation to speak at a Fujitsu conference. Amnesia, I guess.\nThen we have Nadhim Zahawi, fresh from playing himself in ITV’s Mr Bates vs The Post Office. He too was in the Commons to take a victory lap for all his hard work. To see his call for a group pardon granted. Mmm. Just remember this was the former chancellor who was sacked for breaking the ministerial code after being found to have tried to pay less tax than he owed. Get your head round that. A tax dodger speaking out on behalf of people falsely accused of being on the take. Only in Westminster.\nThese are just a couple. There are many – oh so many – of others to be found in all parties and in all corners of the Commons. The quiet ones. The ones who could never be arsed to turn up to any of the UQs or ministerial statements. Who never quite saw what the fuss was all about, nor worried that efforts to overturn convictions and award compensation were taking place at glacial speed. Until last week. At which point they morphed into dogged pursuers of the truth.\nThere were also some in-betweeners. Step forward Lee Anderson’s favourite Tory MP, Lee Anderson. Back in February 2022, Lee spoke for 20 seconds during a UQ about a wrongly accused post office operator in his Ashfield constituency. Since then, according to the official record of parliamentary debates, he has said nothing on the subject. Nor was he inclined to remain in the Commons after PMQs for the UQ in which the junior business minister, Kevin Hollinrake, would update the house on overturning convictions en masse. Poor Lee. Suffering from compassion fatigue. Again. It happens so much to him. He just can’t stop caring.\nBut all this is more than enough for Anderson to be recognised as a total legend in Westminster. A member of the ranks of the “tireless campaigners” who have spoken at least once during the 25-year scandal. Where would the post office operators have been without him? So Lee took it upon himself to make one last effort at the start of PMQs. To speak on behalf of all the other tireless campaigners in the Tory ranks.\nWhat Anderson wanted. No. What Anderson demanded was that Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader who remarkably hadn’t been able to make it to this week’s PMQs – so, so sorry, absolutely gutted – to resign. Or be made to resign. To clear off. He could never be forgiven for the way he had treated the post office operators during his two-year stint as Post Office minister during the early days of the coalition.\nLee should be careful what he wishes for. Politicising Horizon is a zero sum game. Because for all the “tireless campaigners” there are dozens of other MPs – most of whom are in his own party – who also have their guilty secrets. Ranging from those whose mere lack of interest and inertia enabled the saga to drag on for years longer than it should have, to those more actively involved and compromised. Their culpability over exposed.\nRishi Sunak had clearly decided discretion was the better part of valour. He ignored the calls for Davey’s resignation, choosing instead to leak Hollinrake’s announcement half an hour early and to lament the situation in general. Just as well, perhaps. As prime minister he had never shown any interest in the scandal and as chancellor he had given Fujitsu a further £4.9bn in contracts. That’s after Fujitsu were found to have actively concealed the faults in their own software and had shifted the blame to the innocent. Nice work for Fujitsu if you can get it.\nAfter his own hymn to Horizon, Keir Starmer also dropped the subject. He too is facing questions as to why he didn’t intervene in the handful of prosecutions brought by the CPS. But in any case, there was much more fun to be had by him tormenting Sunak with his general levels of hopelessness. Starting with the recent revelation that Rish! had wanted to scrap the Rwanda scheme during his leadership bid in 2022. Not from a moral point of view – obvs, Sunak doesn’t have principles – but because it wasn’t value for money. It didn’t work.\nRish! burbled and got tetchy, pretending not to listen while Starmer mocked him with phrases like “Mr Nobody”. Of course he did. Because that’s what he always does. He didn’t deny the claims, just insisted they must have happened to another Rishi Sunak, before going on to say the country had never been in better shape. Everything was going terribly well, thanks to him. My Thousand-Year Plan.\nLabour had nothing but empty slogans, he insisted, before mindlessly repeating his own slogan about Starmer returning the country to square one. Please! Bring it on. Square one is dreamland compared to where we are now. Sunak just looked beaten. Being humiliated is getting to be a habit. Even his most loyal colleagues can barely bring themselves to look him in the eye.\nThat just left time for the SNP’s Stephen Flynn to insist that Horizon couldn’t have happened north of the border if Scotland had voted for independence. Those with glass motorhomes shouldn’t throw stones … Still, at least everyone could agree that they had all done their best. Repressed self-congratulation was the order of the day. Alan Bates might see it differently.\n\nJohn Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

        "content": "\n 5.47pm GMT \nAfternoon summary\n\n\nRishi Sunak has announced a plan to grant an unprecedented blanket acquittal for hundreds of post office operators wrongly convicted in the Horizon IT scandal. Responding to an urgent question about this after PMQs, Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minster, said the inquiry into the scandal had shown that the Post Office acted not just with incompetence, but with “malevolence” too. (See 12.49pm.)\n\n\nLawyers have warned against setting a precedent of government interference in the justice system after the plans for blanket laws to exonerate the post office operators were announced. As PA Media reports, while many welcomed proposals for legislation which could clear the names of hundreds of post office branch managers in England and Wales by the end of the year, some barristers and solicitors cautioned the government against setting a “legal and constitutional precedent”. Sam Townend KC, chairman of the Bar Council, said:\n\n\nWe will examine the proposals carefully. Anxious care should be taken as to ensuring the independence of the judiciary and the government must be careful about setting legal and constitutional precedent.\nThere are many lessons to be learned from the Post Office scandal. Not only is there a clear case for parliament to review the ability of certain corporate bodies to bring private prosecutions but it also highlights the vital importance of access to legal advice and the urgent need to repair confidence in the justice system.\n\n\nPressure is mounting on the government to review more than £2bn in new contracts awarded to Fujitsu since a court ruling in 2019 found its Horizon IT system caused accounting errors that were blamed on more than 900 post office operators who were then wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office.\n\n\nMichael Gove has refused to set a deadline for an independent report on allegations of “corruption, wrongdoing and illegality” at Teesworks, the industrial development within the government’s high-profile freeport project.\n\n\nThe estimated cost of the HS2 line from London to Birmingham has ballooned to as much as £66bn, the scheme’s executive chair has told MPs.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.55pm GMT\n\n\n 4.40pm GMT \nPublic approve of government's handling of Israel-Hamas war more than Labour's, poll suggests\n\nOne of the reasons why many Tories fear they have no chance of winning the next election is because the Labour party is ahead on all the issues that count. Here is a chart from a UK in a Changing Europe report on public opinion published last month that shows Labour leading on the economy, law and order, the NHS, education, housing and immigration. On other mainstream issues, Labour would be ahead too.\nBut today it has emerged that the Conservatives have a lead on at least one issue, and it is a surprising one. YouGov polling commissioned by Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu) shows that people think the government’s handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been better than Labour’s.\nAsked about the government’s handling of the conflict, 17% of respondents said they approved and 29% said they disapproved – a net score of –12.\nBut, asked about Labour’s handling of the conflict, only 9% said they approved and 30% said they disapproved – a net score of -21.\nThis is surprising in some respects because, in terms of what they have said about the conflict, it is very hard to differentiate between the UK government’s position and the shadow cabinet’s. The poll, which also found 71% of people in favour of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and only 12% opposed, seems to have been commissioned with the intention of showing that both main parties are out of touch with public opinion. The Tories and Labour have both avoided calling for an immediate ceasefire, advocating humanitarian pauses instead.\nAs for why the figures for the two parties are so different, there are probably three main explanations.\nFirst, the figures reflect the fact that Tory-leaning voters are more likely to say they back the government’s approach (30%) but not to say they back Labour’s approach (8%). Labour-leaning voters, on this issue at least, are a bit less tribal. Some 47% of them disapprove of the government’s approach, but 35% of them disapprove of Labour’s too.\nSecond, Keir Starmer has faced at least eight frontbench resignations over his Gaza policy, and dozens more at councillor level. For many respondents, that must compound the perception that his response has been problematic.\nAnd, third, YouGov asked about the government’s handling of the conflict, not the Conservative party’s. The results might have been different if the Tories had been mentioned in the question because their reputation is so toxic.\nChris Doyle, the director of Caabu, said the findings should be a wake-up call. He said:\n\nThis poll shows a total and utter lack of public confidence in the way both the UK government and the Labour party have handled this. The figures could hardly be lower. This should be a wake-up call to the political leaderships to realign themselves both with public sentiment, international law and the need to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.32pm GMT\n\n\n 3.34pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 3.07pm GMT \n\nIn its splash on the Post Office Horizon scandal this morning the Daily Telegraph said that at least 27 of the prosecutions were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service, not the Post Office, “raising serious questions about whether Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, oversaw a number of wrongful convictions during his five-year tenure as director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013”.\nAt Labour’s post-PMQs briefing, a spokesperson for Keir Starmer said Starmer was not aware of these cases when he was DPP. They did not cross his desk, the spokesperson said.\n\nUpdated at 5.15pm GMT\n\n\n 2.25pm GMT \n\nKevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, has now finished responding to the UQ on the Post Office Horizon scandal. It went on for more than an hour and a half.\nHere is our story about the announcement.\n\n Related: Rishi Sunak announces plan to pass law quashing Horizon scandal convictions \n\n\n\n\n 2.12pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer would also back Alan Bates getting a knighthood. (See 2.03pm.) At a post-PMQs briefing, Starmer’s spokesperson was asked about this campaign and said:\n\nAlan Bates clearly has emerged as a hero throughout this for the way in which he has led the campaign, the fortitude and resolve he was shown given everything that has been thrown at him throughout this process.\nObviously honours have their own independent process, but I’m sure that is something the public would regard as entirely appropriate and we would support.\n\n\n\n\n 2.03pm GMT \nNo 10 backs call for Post Office justice campaigner Alan Bates to receive knighthood\n\nEsther McVey, who has embraced the title of “minister for common sense” in her role as Cabinet Office minister without portfolio, has told GB News that she hopes Alan Bates, the post office operator who led the campaign to get justice for colleagues wrongly convicted, gets a knighthood. She said:\n\nI’m quite convinced this man is an extraordinary person and the public will be behind him. Anybody can nominate him and I’m quite sure we will see Sir Alan as soon as possible.\n\nAs Harry Cole from the Sun reports, at the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the PM’s secretary more or less confirmed the knighthood was in the post.\n\n\nNEW: No10 back knighthood for Alan Bates after Minister for Common Sense Esther McVey says it should be done “as soon as possible.”PM’s Press Secretary says “that sounds like common sense to me.”— Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) January 10, 2024\n\n\nIt is certainly a popular cause.

When he needed to deal with this issue, instead of just accepting the line he was given, he asked for a proper briefing. But he was told Paula Vennells, the Post Office boss, said she would refuse to meet him unless accompanied by her lawyer.\nUPDATE: Freeman said:\n\nI was never minister for the Post Office, but I remember as a minister in the department being asked to cover for an absent minister, and when refusing to just read out the speech but ask for a proper day of briefings from officials, and asked to meet Paula Vennells, I was told she would refuse to meet me without her lawyer …\nI want to highlight that this saga raises some very important issues about scrutiny, accountability, responsibility in our public office and in public administration, difficult questions that this house must tackle.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.15pm GMT\n\n\n 1.36pm GMT \n\nKarl Turner (Lab) asks if the government will ensure that the Post Office is never allowed to prosecute anyone ever again.\nHollinrake says the government has been looking at this issue.

He says he expects Chalk to make a statement to MPs at some point.\n\n\n\n 1.34pm GMT \n\nBack in the Commons Maria Miller (Con) says this case highlights the need to ban the use of non-disclosure agreements in cases like this, because the Post Office used them to silence critics of what it was doing. Does Hollinrake agree they should not be used in cases like this?\nHollinrake says he will be happy to speak to Miller about her concerns. But he says non-disclosure agreements cannot stop people going to the police when they suspect wrongdoing.\n\nUpdated at 1.38pm GMT\n\n\n 1.29pm GMT \n\nAt the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson was unable to say how many sub-post office operators would be affected by the legislation, or how much compensation would be paid.\nAnd he said the government would be working with administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where justice is devolved, to ensure Post Office workers in those countries subject to unsafe convictions are also cleared.\n\n\n\n 1.26pm GMT \nHollinrake says bill to quash Post Office convictions would have happened anyway, but ITV drama did 'push things forward'\n\nHollinrake tells MPs he thinks the government would have ended up announcing legislation of this kind anyway, even without the ITV drama, but he says the programme (Mr Bates vs The Post Office) did speed up the process.\nUPDATE: Hollinrake said:\n\nLast November we introduced the fixed sum award. That’s way before the TV series of course … And we started to look at different ways to overturn convictions way before the TV series was aired.\nSo it’s not the case that this TV series – excellent though it was – has … resulted in these different changes. It’s fair to say I think the whole House and the whole country was shocked by what it’s seen on the television, so it has made it easier to push certain things forward more quickly.\nBut I think we would have arrived at this position anyway. But I’m glad we’re here today moving forward at the pace we’re moving it forward now.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.20pm GMT\n\n\n 1.19pm GMT \n\nSir Bob Neill (Con), the chair of the Commons justice committee, says this move is unprecedented. He suggests he has concerns about overturning decisions of the judiciary like this and he asks if the government will publish a draft brill for swift scrutiny (by his committee, presumably) and if he will ensure that, because of its constitutional implications, it goes to a committee of the whole house (meaning all MPs can take part in the committee stage debates and votes, not just members of the bill committee).\nHollinrake says he will discuss these points with Neill.\n\nUpdated at 1.22pm GMT\n\n\n 1.16pm GMT \n\nThis is what the PM’s spokesperson told journalist at the post-PMQs lobby briefing about the Post Office Horizon legislation.\n\nWe will introduce new primary legislation to quash all convictions that were based on erroneous Horizon evidence or the egregious behaviour of the Post Office in the period in question.\nThis will be done on a blanket basis, clearing people’s names and making sure they access the compensation they rightly deserve as quickly as possible instead of waiting for years for the courts to wade through hundreds of convictions.\nWe will in the coming days consider whether to include the small number of cases that already have been considered by the appeal courts.\nWe will also make sure that postmasters who played a crucial role in first exposing the scandal receive the compensation they deserve.\nThese individuals, known as the Group Litigation Order (GLO) cohort, who did not receive a criminal conviction but paid out considerable sums of money because of Horizon failures, will receive an upfront offer now of at least £75,000 of compensation.\n\n\n\n\n 1.14pm GMT \n\nKevan Jones (Lab) says Kevin Hollinrake was not allowed to make a statement because Rishi Sunak wanted to announce the news himself.\nWhen a minister is down to make a statement, the PM is normally expected not to give any details of it in advance at PMQs. In practice, if Sunak had confirmed that the government was going to legislate, but asked MPs to wait for half an hour before the minister set out the details, no one would have minded very much. But the announcement in parliament late morning that a ministerial announcement had been scheduled would have been seen by journalists as confirmation that legislation was coming. In the event, Sunak got to break the news himself.\n\nUpdated at 1.23pm GMT\n\n\n 1.09pm GMT \n\nDuncan Baker (Con) asks how much money the Post Office “stole” from people in this scandal.\nHollinrake says Baker is probably the only former postmaster in the Commons.\nHe does not have a number, but he will try to get one, he says.\nHe says, before Horizon was introduced, there were around five convictions of sub-post office operators a year. That went up to 60 a year after Horizon was introduced, he says.\n\nUpdated at 1.12pm GMT\n\n\n 1.06pm GMT \n\nMarion Fellows for the SNP says payments to victims should not be referred to as compensation. It is financial redress, she says.\n\n\n\n 1.02pm GMT \n\nIn response to the questions from Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secrary, Hollinrake says it may take some weeks to come up with the legislation.\nAnd he says the scheme will cover victims who were penalised because of problems with the pilot version of Horizon.\n\n\n\n 1.00pm GMT \n\nDavid Davis (Con), who tabled the UQ, says some victims of the scandal are not happy about the idea of a mass exoneration because they feel that leaves them lumped in with the handful of people who might have been guilty.\nAnd he asks if the government will recover compensation from Fujitsu, the company behind the flawed Horizon IT.\nHollinrake says it would not have been possible to do individual exonerations without “an exhaustive and time-consuming administrative process”.\nAnd he says the government will consider recovering money from Fujitsu once the inquiry is over, and it has established who was responsible for what went wrong.\n\nUpdated at 1.02pm GMT\n\n\n 12.56pm GMT \n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, says he allowed Hollinrake to speak for longer than is normal when replying to UQ. He says he understands that Hollinrake wanted to make a Commons statement, but was overruled. He says that is why he granted the UQ.\nThis is curious. It implies Sunak wanted to make an announcement at PMQs, but did not want to have a minister taking questions about the detail.\n\nUpdated at 1.02pm GMT\n\n\n 12.54pm GMT \nWhat Hollinrake told MPs about how legislation to quash unsafe Post Office convictions will work\n\nHollinrake is now talking about the legislation to exonerate the hundreds of post office operators whose convictions are unsafe.\nHe says the law will overturn the convictions of all those convicted in England and Wales on the basis of Post Office evidence.\nHe accepts there is a risk of people rightly being convicted being let off. But the only alternative would be to consider every case, and that is impractical, he says.\nHe says people who accept the exoneration will have to sign a statement saying they are innocent. He says that if it turns out subsequently they were not telling the truth, they will be at risk of prosecution for fraud.\nUPDATE: Hollinrake said:\n\nWe are being faced with a dilemma: either accept the present problem of many people carrying the unjustified slur of conviction, or accept that an unknown number of people who have genuinely stolen from their Post Office will be exonerated and perhaps even compensated.\nI can therefore announce that we intend to bring forward legislation as soon as we can to overturn the convictions of all those convicted in England or Wales on the basis of Post Office evidence given during the Horizon scandal.\nThe government will, in the coming days, consider whether to include the small number of cases that have already been considered by the appeal courts and the convictions upheld.\nWe recognise this is an exceptional step, but these are exceptional circumstances …\nAs far as possible we want to avoid guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money, but we cannot make the provision of compensation subject to a detailed examination of guilt.\nAll we ask is that as part of their claims of compensation postmasters sign a statement to the effect they did not commit the crimes of which they are accused. Anyone subsequently found to have signed such a statement untruthfully will be putting themselves at risk of prosecution of fraud.\nI do not pretend to the house that this is a foolproof device, but it is a proportionate one which respects the ordeal which these people have already suffered.\nIt means that an honest postmaster will have his or her conviction overturned and just by signing one document can secure compensation.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.22pm GMT\n\n\n 12.49pm GMT \nHollinrake says Post Office Horizon inquiry has shown evidence of 'not only incompetence, but malevolence'\n\nKevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, is now responding to the UQ about the Post Office Horizon scandal.\nHe refers to the announcement made by the PM earlier.\nAnd he says 30 people who suffered wrongful convictions have now accepted the £600,000 upfront offer as an alternative to going through the detailed compensation assessment scheme. Previously only five people had accepted this.\nHe says, under the plan announced by the PM, people will be able to apply for a £75,000 upfront payment. But they will still be able to go through the detailed compensation scheme if they want.\nHe says the evidence from the inquiry has shown evidence of “not only incompetence, but malevolence in many of their actions” by the Post Office. This evidence was not available at the time of the prosecutions, he says.\nUPDATE: Hollinrake said:\n\nHundreds of convictions remain extant. Some of those convictions will have relied on evidence from the discredited Horizon system; others will have been the result of appalling failures of the Post Office’s investigation and prosecution functions. The evidence already emerging from Sir Wyn Williams’s inquiry has shown not only incompetence, but malevolence in many of their actions. This evidence was not available to the courts when they made their decisions on individual cases. So far, 95 out of more than 900 convictions have been overturned. We know that postmasters have been reluctant to apply to have their convictions overturned-many of them have decided that they have been through enough and cannot face further engagement with authority. Many fear having their hopes raised, only for them to be dashed yet again.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.01pm GMT\n\n\n 12.41pm GMT \n\nRosena Allin-Khan (Lab) says some children in Gaza are having to have limbs amputated without pain relief. She asks for more aid for Gaza and for Israel to stop attacking health facilities.\nSunak says that he wants more aid going into Gaza, and that he has raised the plight of civilians with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM.\n\nUpdated at 12.42pm GMT\n\n\n 12.40pm GMT \n\nKatherine Fletcher (Con) asks about trains in her constituency, and a local station. Sunak says Fletcher is a fantastic advocate for her constituents, and that this sounds like a good idea.\n\nUpdated at 12.41pm GMT\n\n\n 12.38pm GMT \n\nMarian Fellows (SNP) asks what may be the final question of PMQs. She asks if the government will back a social tariff for energy bills.\nSunak says he will ensure Fellows gets a meeting to discuss this. The government is working to ensure vulnerable people this winter get support, he says.\n\nUpdated at 1.04pm GMT\n\n\n 12.36pm GMT \nPMQs - snap verdict\n\nIt’s always good to admit your mistakes, so here goes. This morning I said Rishi Sunak would want to announce Post Office Horizon legislation because a big story like this can be “a very useful defence mechanism at PMQs”. (See 9.28am.) He did give us the story, but, as a defence mechanism, it turned out to be hopeless. Keir Starmer left Sunak bouncing off the ropes after one of his most comprehensive PMQs goings-over probably ever.\nArguments work well at PMQs, but nothing is more deadly than ridicule. Gordon Brown’s reputation was never quite the same after Vince Cable described him as going “from Stalin to Mr Bean” and at times Starmer’s withering descriptions of the PM were laugh-out-loud funny. At one point Labour was wary of attacking Sunak over immigration, traditionally a Tory issue, but increasingly Labour is taking the view that the Rwanda scheme is a policy albatross. It was telling that Sunak could not convincingly deny originally having doubts about the idea. Starmer has repeatedly denounced Sunak as out of touch, but today the accusations sounded more plausible than ever. And Sunak was strikingly short on retaliatory material. At one point Sunak and CCHQ were obsessive about the Labour £28bn green plan being a ladder to higher taxes, but Starmer’s repeated denials on this front may have closed that down a bit.\nInstead Sunak was left primarily with the “don’t let Labour take Britain back to square one” line he deployed on Monday. In a country where square one sounds like an improvement on what we have, that did not work then, and it did not work today.\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.23pm GMT \n\nAlex Norris (Lab) asks if Sunak had a meeting with a donor who gave him £38,000 for the use of a private jet. He is referring to this story.\nSunak says all his donations are declared in the normal way.\n\n\n\n 12.19pm GMT \n\nSunak says the government thinks there is a “very good basis” for the power-sharing executive to be restored in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n 12.18pm GMT \n\nCaroline Ansell (Con) asks about the concerns of those who object to children being told they can be born the wrong sex. She asks if parents will be involved in the consultation on the new trans guidance for schools.\nSunak says parents are being consulted. And people should be free to stress the importance of biological sex, he says.\n\nUpdated at 12.49pm GMT\n\n\n 12.17pm GMT \n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says post office operators never stood a chance against the Westminster establishment.\nSunak says this is one of the greatest scandals in history. The government has set up an inquiry, and set up three different compensation schemes. But the government is going further. That is why it has announced a new law today.\nFlynn says this is not just about subpostmasters. Ask the Waspi women, or the victims of the infected blood inquiry, or the victims of Hillsborough. “They are angry at Westminster because they know that this place never really changes, does it?”\nSunak says he is sad Flynn is trying to politicise this.\n(He did not say that to Lee Anderson – see 12.03pm.)\n\nUpdated at 4.55pm GMT\n\n\n 12.13pm GMT \n\nStarmer says Sunak is out of touch. He just sees the country from his private jet, and does not know schools where pupils don’t turn up. \n\nDoesn’t the country deserve so much better than a prime minister who simply doesn’t get Britain? \n\nSunak says the government has just cut tax. Starmer does not have a single idea, he says. He says the Tories have a plan, and Labour would just take Britain back to square one.\n\n\n\n 12.11pm GMT \n\nStarmer says he spent five years of his life as DPP fighting people-smuggling gangs. He says services are collapsing. People are literally pulling out their own teeth because they cannot get access to NHS dentistry. He says Sunak “spent his time boasting whilst Britain is breaking”.\nSunak says Labour has no plan for the future. He says Labour is controlled by the unions.\n\nUpdated at 12.52pm GMT\n\n\n 12.09pm GMT \n\nStarmer says Sunak cannot be honest because he is afraid of his own party.\nSunak says Starmer is someone who thinks all immigration laws are racist.\n\n\n\n 12.08pm GMT \nStarmer ridicules Sunak's U-turns over election messaging and dubs him 'Mr Nobody'\n\nStarmer says he does believe in stopping the people-smuggling gangs.\nHe goes on:\n\nMr Speaker, last year, [Sunak] started the year saying he was Mr Steady. Then he was Mr Change. Now he’s flipped back to Mr More of the Same. It doesn’t matter how many relaunches and flip-flops he does. He’ll always be Mr Nobody.\n\nSunak again attacks Starmer for refusing to back the government’s immigration policy, and says Starmer puts the criminal gangs ahead of the British people every time.\n\nUpdated at 12.53pm GMT\n\n\n 12.06pm GMT \n\nStarmer says Sunak has been caught red-handed. Who should MPs believe? The Sunak before us today, or the one “who used to believe in something”.\nSunak says Starmer picks the people smugglers over the needs of the British people.\n\nUpdated at 12.53pm GMT\n\n\n 12.04pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer welcomes the Post Office announcement.\nHe says one Tory MP had considerable doubts about Boris Johnson’s Rwanda scheme when it was announced. What has happened to that MP?\nSunak says Starmer is talking about a document (leaked to the BBC) that he has not seen and Starmer has not seen. He says he wants to stop the boats, unlike Starmer.\n\n\n\n 12.03pm GMT \nSunak says government will legislate to exonerate victims of Post Office Horizon scandal\n\nLee Anderson, the Tory party deputy chair, says Ed Davey was in charge during the Post Office scandal. Davey has called for more than 30 people to resign over mistakes. Does the PM agree Davey should resign too?\nSunak says this is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in history. He says the inquiry is under way and almost £150m has been paid in compensation.\nBut he says the government will introduce primary legislation to ensure those convicted are exonerated.\nAnd he announced an extra £75,000 compensation payment for victims.\nUPDATE: Sunak said:\n\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history.\nPeople who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and their reputations destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own. The victims must get justice and compensation …\nToday I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\nWe will also introduce a new up-front payment of £75,000 for the vital GLO (group litigation order) group of postmasters.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.25pm GMT\n\n\n 12.00pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak starts with the usual spiel about the meetings he is having.\n\n\n\n 11.53am GMT \n\nHere is the list of MPs down to ask a question at PMQs.\n\n\n\n 11.52am GMT \nRishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs\n\nRishi Sunak is about to take PMQs for the first time this year.\n\n\n\n 11.50am GMT \n\nScottish ministers will discuss Fujitsu contracts related to local elections counts following criticism of the firm’s role in the Post Office IT scandal.\nSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Holyrood’s justice minister Angela Constance said she would speak with fellow ministers about the deal signed in 2020 to support electronic vote counts for local elections. She said:\n\nThat wouldn’t necessarily be a matter for me as justice secretary, that may be a matter for the government as a whole and for other ministers but I shall certainly discuss it with other ministers.\n\nHer comments came after a BBC freedom of information request revealed that Scotland’s prosecution service became aware of possible problems with the Horizon software system a decade ago.\nIn Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service had sole responsibility for prosecuting Horizon cases and, although they estimate up to 100 individuals may have been affected, only two convictions in Scotland have so far been overturned.\nConstance added that she was committed to achieving justice for those wrongly convicted, but that any legal recourse must preserve their right to compensation under the UK-wide scheme.\n\n\n\n 11.48am GMT \n\nRishi Sunak is facing a revolt by Tory MPs later today when the Commons votes to give the economic activity of public bodies (overseas activities) bill a third reading. The vote will take place early in the evening, after MPs have debated the finance bill. Aubrey Allegretti from the Times says around a dozen Conservatives will refuse to vote for the bill.\n\nRishi Sunak faces his first rebellion of the new year later today.I’m told around a dozen Tory MPs - led by former cabinet minister Kit Malthouse - will likely not vote for the third reading of the anti-BDS bill.\n\n\n\nRishi Sunak faces his first rebellion of the new year later today.I'm told around a dozen Tory MPs - led by former cabinet minister Kit Malthouse - will likely not vote for the third reading of the anti-BDS bill.— Aubrey Allegretti (@breeallegretti) January 10, 2024\n\n\nThe bill, which was introduced by Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, in the last session of parliament and which has been carried over, is intended to stop councils and other public authorities conducting boycott, divestment and sanctions campaigns against other countries, but it is seen as designed primarily to stop leftwing councils implementing anti-Israel boycotts.\nLabour has tabled a reasoned amendment saying the bill should not get a third reading. Explaining why, it says:\n\nIt does not effectively address the problem it rightly seeks to solve, is incompatible with international law and UN Security Council Resolutions, risks undermining support for groups around the world facing persecution, includes needlessly broad and sweeping draconian powers while placing unprecedented restrictions on public bodies to express a view on current and proposed policy and represents a major departure from the UK Government’s long-established diplomatic position on the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Golan Heights, in a way that undermines the UK’s future credibility and capacity to support diplomatic negotiations towards a just and lasting peace in Israel and Palestine based on a two-state solution, at a time when consistent support for that objective is more important than ever.\n\n\n\n\n 11.33am GMT \nSenior police officers think ministers have subjected them to 'improper pressure', watchdog says\n\nPolice chiefs believe “senior political figures” are subjecting them to improper pressure or interference, the official policing inspectorate today says.\nThe finding will be seen as a direct reference to the former home secretary Suella Braverman and comes after the government and senior officers clashed over the policing of protests.\nBraverman had asked Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services to examine alleged political bias in policing. Today the inspectorate released an update via a letter to the current home secretary James Cleverly.\nIn November government wanted a pro-Palestinian march on Armistice Day in central London to be stopped, but police insisted there were no powers to do so.\nPolice in the United Kingdom are supposed to be operationally independent from interference from politicians.\nIn a letter released today, Andy Cooke, His Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary wrote:\n\nOne of the most consistent themes in the evidence we have obtained so far is the extent to which senior national political figures directly or indirectly influence, or attempt to influence, police operations.\nSenior police leaders told us that when this takes place in public, it makes it harder to maintain an appearance of impartiality. Most senior officers told us that they experience what they believe to be improper pressure or interference from significant political figures, whether through direct contact or through the media. Many cited this commission and the associated correspondence as one example of this …\nRecent events concerning the policing of protests have highlighted the need for greater understanding as to what is meant by the term ‘operational independence’.\n\nThe inquiry was ordered last year in a letter to the inspectorate in September 2023 Setting out her reasons, Braverman said:\n\nI am concerned that public displays of allegiance with political causes opens some forces up to accusations of virtue-signalling, and that related activity by others (such as staff networks), is having a negative effect on community confidence.\nThat effect may be felt by either distracting policing from its core role of preventing and detecting crime and bringing offenders to justice or by giving the impression that policing is distracted from that role. The essential function of the police is to uphold the law. I am concerned that resources which might otherwise have been allocated to dealing with thefts, robberies and assaults are giving way to other activities. Further, that when officers adopt or participate in political or social campaigns, for example, by taking the knee, they risk losing the support of the public. This is not common sense policing.\n\nBraverman was sacked as home secretary in November, just after the pro-Palestinian march went ahead with far right elements clashing with police. Braverman had publicly claimed just before the march that police appeared to treat the rightwing demonstrators more harshly than those associated with progressive causes, a claim largely derided.\nThe letter from Cooke says the full report will be finished this year.\nUPDATE: An ally of Suella Braverman said: \n\nIt’s funny how we don’t hear the police being too critical when they’re taking it upon themselves to criticise politicians’ descriptions of criminals and extremists. They should get on with their jobs instead of hiding behind an expansive and meaningless understanding of ‘operational independence’.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.28pm GMT\n\n\n 11.25am GMT \n\nThere are two byelections coming up in Tory seats, in Wellinborough, where Peter Bone had a majority of 18,540 in 2019, and in Kingswood, where Chris Skidmore’s majority was 11,220. According to Politico, the government is expected to move the writs for both byelections tomorrow, with Thursday 15 February earmarked as the date for both of them.\nYesterday Labour selected as its candidate Damian Egan.

The UQ has been tabled by the Conservative MP David Davis.\nThis helps to explain why, in his interview with the Today programme this morning, Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, was not able to confirm that he would be attending the meeting of the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board due to take place at 1.30pm. Hollinrake told the programme that he was not sure what parliamentary duties he would have in the afternoon that might stop him going.\n\n\n\n 10.43am GMT \n\nThis morning the Daily Telegraph has splashed on a story claiming that one of the key engineers who designed the flawed Horizon IT system that led to sub-post office operators being wrongly convicted is saying he won’t give evidence to the inquiry into the scandal unless he gets immunity.\n\n\nTELEGRAPH: Architect of postal scandal demands immunity #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/gVgvcHq9xT— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) January 9, 2024\n\n\nAsked about the story in an interview this morning, Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, said:\n\nThat’s absolutely the wrong approach for that person to take if those reports are true.

He went on:\n\nIt is the government’s longstanding policy that infrastructure estimates are only updated at spending review points, that’s my understanding of it.\nSo that’s why we’re still working to 2019 prices and the whole conversation about 2019, which is to be frank with you an administrative burden of some significance in the organisation.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.04am GMT\n\n\n 10.17am GMT \n\nHere is the Commons paper with the latest amendments tabled to the Rwanda bill. Dan Bloom has been taking a look for Politico’s London Playbook. He says:\n\nSome 35 right-wingers so far are behind an amendment by Tory veteran Bill Cash (amendment number 10) to put “notwithstanding” clauses back in the bill — letting it defy international law.\nThey’re also backing a flood of amendments by ex-immigration minister Robert Jenrick, including to … block most “suspensive claims” by migrants against their removal (19-22) … disapply the Human Rights Act to the new bill and last year’s Illegal Migration Act (11-18) … and make it the “default” that “rule 39” orders from the European court of human rights are not binding (23-25).\n\n\nUpdated at 11.05am GMT\n\n\n 9.57am GMT \nJenrick and Braverman tell PM Rwanda bill won't work as rightwing Tories back amendments to make it tougher\n\nRishi Sunak is braced for a Commons showdown over his Rwanda plan after being warned by Tory MPs that the proposal will not work unless it is significantly beefed up, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nAs the right wing of the Conservative party gears up for a parliamentary battle, the prime minister was warned by the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick that the plan “simply doesn’t work” in its current form.\nDozens of rightwing Conservatives are backing amendments to the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill aimed at effectively ignoring international law and to severely limit individual migrants’ ability to resist being put on a flight to Kigali.\nJenrick refused to say whether he would vote for the legislation if it were not rewritten.\n“This is the third piece of legislation in three years. It’s three strikes or you’re out, we’ve got to get this right,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today this morning.\nThe measures Jenrick and his allies are pushing would end what he called the “merry-go-round of individual claims whereby illegal migrants claim every possible defence in order to frustrate their removal to Rwanda” and would prevent flights being grounded by emergency injunctions from the European court of human rights.\nThe government’s bill and a treaty with Rwanda are intended to make the scheme legally watertight following a supreme court ruling against the plan.\nBut Jenrick said: “[The] government’s reported legal advice is that the bill has a 50% chance at best of getting a single flight off to Rwanda before the general election. When the stakes are so high for the country I don’t think that’s acceptable. We need to make sure it’s much more rigorous than that.”\nJenrick said the amendments aimed at toughening up the Rwanda bill were in line with international law, one of the tests set by Sunak for any changes as the Kigali government has warned the deal could fall apart if the UK breaks international conventions.\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman, who backs the changes put forward by Jenrick and Sir Bill Cash, said: “To not adopt these amendments, and introduce another failing bill, will be a betrayal of the British people.”\nWriting in the Daily Mail, she said: “As drafted, this bill will not stop the boats. The government’s own lawyers have also reportedly advised that the scheme, as currently laid out, is fundamentally flawed. They rightly conclude that it will be bogged down with individual legal challenges from migrants.”\n\n\nUpdated at 11.07am GMT\n\n\n 9.51am GMT \nMinisters prioritised driving in England partly due to conspiracy theories\n\nMinisters decided to prioritise driving over active travel because of worries among ministers about “15-minute cities”, documents seen by the Guardian show.

Kevin Hollinrake, a minister in the department for business, has been doing a morning interview round this morning. Normally when a junior minister does the morning interview round they end up being asked topics about which they know not much more than you or me, but today the interviews were a bit more illuminating than normal. Hollinrake is minister for postal services, and so he is well briefed on the story of the day, but he is also an MP who was taking an interest in the Post Office Horizon scandal even before he joined the government.\nRishi Sunak is taking PMQs at noon and, after Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, told MPs yesterday that an announcement about a possible move to quash all the unsafe Post Office convictions in one go might be coming soon, there is intense speculation that Sunak will unveil the news in the chamber. Prime ministers always like to be identified with “good” government announcements, and having a “story” like this up your sleeve is a very useful defence mechanism at PMQs. In his interviews Hollinrake did not confirm that the announcement would come today, but he said it was “very, very close”.\nHe also claimed that this was not soley a response to the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which propelled this long-running scandal to the very top of the news agenda. In an interview on the Today programme, when Justin Webb put it to him that the government was previously not interested in a blanket move quashing all these unsafe convictions, and that “the only thing that has changed is the ITV drama”, Hollinrake replied:\n\nNot true. We’ve been looking at this for some time. The advisory board we work closely with is very engaged in this. We’ve been dissatisfied with a number of people have come forward trying to overturn those convictions. So this has been something we’ve been deliberating for some time.\n\nHollinrake was referring to the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board. This is due to meet today at 1.30pm, and that may be one factor that prevents a PMQs announcement, because the government will want to have its approval for whatever it announces.\nIn his Today interview Hollinrake said he welcomed the decision by Paula Vennells, the former Post Office boss, to hand back her CBE. But he could not explain why she was given the award in 2019, when a great deal was already known about the unsafe conditions. Hollinrake said giving her the CBE in the first place “was a mistake”.\nVennells is now under pressure to give back the bonuses she received for her work as head of the Post Office. The Daily Mail has splashed on this idea approvingly.\n\n\nMAIL: Now give back your millions #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/VBl3KdrTpI— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) January 9, 2024\n\n\nHollinrake did not support calls for Vennells to have to return bonus payments – or at least not now. He told Today:\n\nOne thing we should not have is trial by media. I think we should let the inquiry run its course. It should report and identify individuals and organisations responsible. At that point in time then sanctions can be placed on those individuals.\n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10.30am: Chris Philp, the policing minister, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the impact of police commissioners.\n10.30am: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, gives evidence to the Commons business committee about investment zones and freeports.\n12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\n2.15pm: Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.\n3pm: Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, and other experts give evidence to the joint committee on human rights on the Rwanda bill.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a laptop or a desktop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.\n\nUpdated at 9.47am GMT\n"

        "content": "Adopting rightwing policies on issues such as immigration and the economy does not help centre-left parties win votes, according to new analysis of European electoral and polling data. Faced with a 20-year decline in their vote share, accompanied by rising support for the right, far right and sometimes the far left, social democratic parties across Europe have increasingly sought salvation by moving towards the political centre. However, the analysis, published on Wednesday, shows that centre-left parties promising, for example, to be tough on immigration or public spending are unlikely to attract potential voters on the right, and risk alienating existing progressive supporters. “Voters tend to prefer the original to the copy,” said Tarik Abou-Chadi, an associate professor of European politics at the University of Oxford and the co-founder of the Progressive Politics Research Network (PPRNet), which launched on Wednesday. Abou-Chadi said the team of political scientists, from universities including Barcelona, Lausanne, Vienna, Zurich and Berlin, was not “aiming to advise or act as political consultants” but to present “careful, empirical, data-based” research. “We’re looking to provide a more solid, accurate foundation for an open political debate about progressive politics, who votes for progressive parties and why, and the strategies available to them,” he said. “That involves a bit of myth-busting.”   Related: Make or break for the EU? Europeans vote in June with far right on the rise   One of the most significant misperceptions the team’s work had revealed, he said, concerned the nature of support for centre-left parties in Europe. “Social structures have been utterly transformed since the heyday of social democracy,” Abou-Chadi said. “The average social democratic voter today is very, very different from 50, even 20 years ago – and unlikely to be an industrial worker. The data also shows much of this new constituency is actually both culturally progressive and economically leftwing.” Analysis showed little real voter competition between the centre left and the radical right, as some social democratic politicians argue. Progressive parties “need to understand and represent the social structures of the 21st century”, Abou-Chadi said. One of the key lessons was that “trying to imitate rightwing positions is just not a successful strategy for the left”, he said. Two studies in particular, looking at so-called welfare chauvinism and fiscal policy, illustrated the point, the researchers said. Björn Bremer of the Central European University in Vienna said a survey in Spain, Italy, the UK and Germany and larger datasets from 12 EU countries showed that since the financial crisis of 2008, “fiscal orthodoxy” had been a vote loser for the centre left. “Social democratic parties that have backed austerity fail to win the support of voters worried about public debt, and lose the backing of those who oppose austerity,” Bremer said. “Centre-left parties that actually impose austerity lose votes.” As an example, Bremer cited the UK Labour party’s losing 2015 election campaign, which focused on fiscal responsibility. “[When] voters really care about fiscal policy, they’ll go for the ‘issue owner’ – in this instance, the Conservatives, who they’ll always believe are more credible on that question,” he said. Fiscal orthodoxy – cutting taxes, capping spending, limiting public debt – worked for social democratic parties such as Tony Blair’s New Labour and Gerhard Schröder’s SPD in Germany, but that was “a period of relative stability and growth”, he said. “We’re now in a different era. The data strongly suggests centre-left parties can build a coalition of voters who believe a strong welfare state, effective public services and real investment, for example in the green transition, are essential,” Bremer said. “But doing the opposite – offering a contradictory programme that promotes austerity but promises to protect public services and the welfare state, and hoping voters will swallow such fairytales – failed in the 2010s, and is likely to fail again.” Similarly, said Matthias Enggist of the University of Lausanne, analysis of data from eight European countries showed no evidence that welfare chauvinism – broadly, restricting immigrants’ access to welfare – was a successful strategy for the left.   Related: The trouble with targets: immigration is a potential headache for Labour   “There’s little support for it among actual leftwing voters – Green, social democrat or radical left – or potential leftwing voters on the right,” Enggist said. “And leftwing voters mostly really dislike discrimination between immigrants and nationals.” Voters who do support welfare chauvinism, meanwhile, are likely to not even consider voting for a left-leaning party, he said, adding there was no evidence that this was a strategy to win back enough traditional working-class votes to significantly boost the electoral fortunes of left parties. Even in Denmark, where a Social Democrat-led government has introduced one of Europe’s toughest anti-immigration regimes, electoral data suggested that restricting immigrants’ rights is not popular with a significant number of the party’s voters. Politicians on the left who argue the case for welfare chauvinism “overestimate its potential to win new voters”, Enggist said. “The evidence clearly shows they overestimate the electoral relevance of traditional, white working-class voters – and underestimate how strongly their current middle-class voters care about immigrants being treated decently and equally.”"

        "content": "Maybe it’s all down to Botox. A daily dose of a hundred tiny needles. Or perhaps, in some dusty attic back in Chipping Norton there’s a portrait that is visibly ageing by the hour. A mirror image of the Picture of Dorian Gray.\nMost former world leaders look like shit after six years in the job. The pressures of work ravage their face. Tony Blair looks like a hollowed-out skull. Even after three years, Boris Johnson looked like Boris Johnson. That bad. But David – make that Lord – Cameron is the remarkable exception. His complexion is still a glossy puce. Barely a wrinkle to be seen.\nIt’s almost surreal. Nothing has got to him. The years of the failed Conservative austerity plan that he initiated and ended with the current cost of living crisis. Nothing. Untouched. As for the careless Brexit referendum that sent the UK into an unnecessary psychodrama from which it is still to recover, Lord Big Dave is as smooth as the day he turned his back and walked away from the country the day after the vote. Not even being caught lobbying for a dodgy financier has left a mark.\nThe secret to Lord Big Dave is that nothing really ever gets to him. He operates almost entirely on a superficial level. The surface is all. And the surface is pure teflon. Nothing sticks to him. Pour any amount of crap on his head and he wipes clean in seconds. The ultimate Shiny, Happy Person.\nMost of us thought we had seen the end of him. To become a curiosity, much like Liz Truss, in the rogue’s gallery of former prime ministers at the Cenotaph. More fool us. Because Rishi Sunak had another plan. Having run out of any suitable candidates among the ranks of his own MPs, he summoned Dave out of retirement. “How about I make you a Lord and you do a year as foreign secretary before I lose the election?”\nThe democratic flaw in the appointment was that Lord Big Dave would be subject to almost no scrutiny from parliament. Foreign Office questions would be a no no. As would making any statement, answering an urgent question or opening a debate. The Untouchable Dave had just become the Even More Untouchable Dave. The only accountability would be the occasional appearance before the foreign affairs select committee.\nWhich is why, two months after he took the job, the profoundly chillaxed Lord Big Dave – flanked by his permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton – was ushered into the Thatcher Room of Portcullis House for his first appearance before the committee. The pair were pursued by any number of teenagers. It seems that the Foreign Office is now being run by people on work experience. Presumably they all leave after a couple of years to take jobs filling shelves at Lidl.\nThe committee chair, Alicia Kearns, was determined to make her presence felt. This was her committee and she wanted maximum air time. Think of it as an audition. For whatever she does after the next election. Panto, perhaps. “So how did you come to get the job?” she asked. It must niggle her that she was never in the frame.\nLord Big Dave breathed out. How he had got all his previous jobs. Contacts. Charm. No real experience. The way you would expect a chap like him to get a job. It had been like this. He had just happened to be in Downing Street – as you do – and Rishi had said that he was planning a reshuffle. So how did he fancy becoming foreign secretary? Quite a lot, actually. It wasn’t the peerage. It was his love of public service. It’s what he lived for. Yup, that would be the Lord Big Dave we know and love. The Lord Big Dave who stuck up two fingers to the country hours after completely wrecking it.\nEr, OK, said Kearns. So how will you be different from your predecessor? By being marginally less dim but just as superficial. Because that’s what the country demands. Not that James Cleverly had done a bad job. More that he didn’t understand that a little more was required than clocking up the air miles and eating well with foreign politicians. And no, it wouldn’t be hard to go along with policies with which he disagreed. Because if history had taught us anything it was that Lord Big Dave never really had any strongly held principles. The secret to a clean conscience is to have no conscience at all.\nAfter that we moved on to Israel and Palestine. Here Lord Big Dave went into schmoozing overdrive. Burble, burble, burble. “All very tricky … Sustained ceasefire … Two-state solution … ” Several MPs on the committee started to get a bit restless. They had rather hoped for some kind of insight that went beyond that of a below average A-level international relations student.\nHis Lordship looked pained. What hadn’t they understood? His whole purpose in life was to hover above the surface. To leave no trace. Bland, meaningless generalisations were his trademark. Besides, did anyone for a minute imagine that either Israel or Hamas took any notice of what he said? His role was purely performative. To act the role of foreign secretary. To make it look like the UK was a global influence. But to keep everything skin deep. The work of an entitled man with boundless self-confidence.\nSeveral times Lord Big Dave was pressed on whether it was the Foreign Office understanding that Israel had broken international humanitarian law. “B-b-but you still misunderstand me,” he said, puffing his cheeks. “My job is to know nothing. That way I can’t deliberately offend anyone.” The MPs turned to Barton, who had hitherto done nothing but nod furiously. Like one of those toy dogs you used to find in cars back in the 70s. Barton was outraged. This too did not compute. His whole purpose was also to be found intellectually wanting. To not ask the difficult questions.\nLabour’s Fabian Hamilton moved to Libya. What did Lord Big Dave make of the committee’s report into his ill-conceived Libyan adventure that had left the country in chaos ever since? “Bunk,” said Dave brusquely. It wasn’t ill-conceived at all. Everyone knew that after a few years every world leader got desperate for an overseas war to make them feel more important. To build a legacy. And this was his. Leaving Libya in the hands of competing warlords had always been priced in.\nAfter two hours of bland generalisations, Lord Big Dave looked hopefully towards Kearns. Could he go now? Loads of the Foreign Office apparatchiks had to get home for their tea. Else they might be late for bed.\n• This article was amended on 9 January 2024.The permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office is Sir Philip Barton, not Philip Norton as an earlier version said.\n\nJohn Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

        "content": "Profits at the former chancellor George Osborne’s family business slumped 98% to £30,000 last year and the company breached the terms of a Covid business loan as it faced increased costs and poor sales in the UK and Europe. Sales at the upmarket fabric and wallpaper purveyor, which was founded by Osborne’s father and his brother-in-law in the 1960s, rose 11% to £32m in the year to 31 March, partly thanks to a deal with Ralph Lauren and strong sales in the US, but sales fell in the UK and Europe. Trading in the subsequent half year was also tough, with sales down 9% in the six months to 30 September. In accounts filed at Companies House this week, Osborne & Little said the “unsettled situation in Europe” contributed to higher costs in terms of inflation, energy prices and interest rate rises, while demand had been hit by the property market slowing down. It said profits had been hit by “significant supplier increases” while “the cost of living increase has applied to all markets”. Sales to Europe fell 3% and UK sales were down almost 5.6% as consumers shied away from expensive homewares as their budgets came under pressure from rising bills and some took a break from home renovations after a boom during the pandemic lockdowns.   Related: George Osborne’s family firm reports jump in costs in wake of Brexit   The company said it had breached the terms of its government-backed coronavirus business interruption loan with HSBC last spring, £742,000 of which still needed to be repaid at the year end. It is the second breach in two years, after it was forced to renegotiate to include monthly liquidity tests in 2022. The latest breach came after cash from Osborne & Little’s operating activities had sunk below an agreed level after it fell into the red. HSBC agreed not to take action and has revised the terms of the loan, removing existing financial tests until March this year and reducing the minimum level of liquidity required for the company to £500,000 from £1.2m. Osborne & Little, which had £1.7m of debt in bank and government-backed loans, and just over £1m in cash at the year end, said it was confident it was a going concern and could meet its liabilities as they fell due. No dividend was paid to shareholders, but during the year the controlling shareholder, Osborne’s father, Sir Peter Osborne, was paid back £140,000 of a £310,000 loan he made to the business in April 2022. Osborne & Little were approached for comment."

        "content": "  6.04pm GMT  Early evening summary   Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has said that recent reports saying Rishi Sunak privately does not support the Rwanda policy (see 11.27am) show why the government should publish confidential document about its full costs. She made the argument as she opened a debate on a Labour motion that would force the government to publish those figures. During her speech Cooper also rubbished the policy. She told MPs:   In the end, the only deterrence it appears the prime minister actually believes in is deterring his backbenchers from getting rid of him. It’s weak, weak, weak. And yet the taxpayer is paying the price. It is a totally farcical situation: a prime minister who doesn’t think it is a deterrent; a home secretary who thinks it’s batshit, a former home secretary [Suella Braverman] who says it won’t work; a former immigration minister [Robert Jenrick] who says it doesn’t do the job; and everyone who thinks what we’ve got is a sham, and it’s an incredibly expensive one, with the taxpayer being conned. So, if ministers disagree with everything that I just said to describe their plans, what is there to hide? Tell us the facts and show us where all of that is wrong.   David Cameron, the foreign secretary, has admitted he is “worried” that Israel may have taken action in Gaza that may be in breach of international law. He made the admission during a hearing with the Commons foreign affairs committee where initially he repeatedly refused to say whether Foreign Office lawyers had advised him that Israel had broken international law. (See 3.26pm.)   Akshata Murty, the millionaire businesswoman and investor married to the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has donated her shares in the childcare company Koru Kids to charity, following concerns about whether she stood to benefit from government policies.   The former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells has said she will hand back her CBE over the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of post office staff. Vennells made the announcement as Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, told MPs that he is considering bringing a bill to parliament to quash the Post Office Horizon convictions that remain unsafe. (See 12.37pm.)   A row has broken out over the government’s role in Channel 4 management appointments after it blocked a minority ethnic woman from joining the broadcaster’s board.   Updated at 6.44pm GMT    5.39pm GMT   Pursglove confirms £240m has already been spent on the Rwanda scheme so far. He says future sums will be set out in annual Home Office reports. Cooper intervenes, and asks why the government has not published the expected costs, as it had done with the deal with France. Pursglove again says the figures will be published annually in the usual way.  Updated at 6.02pm GMT    5.28pm GMT  Labour claims Britain going back on many measures of equality under Tories  Britain is going backwards on many measures of equality, Labour says. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, has made the argument in a Fabian Society pamphlet on inequality. In it she says:  Fifty-three years after Labour’s Equal Pay Act, the gender pay gap has now actually increased for a second year in a row, confounding expectations that a slow and steady reduction in the gap would be most likely. More women, old and young, are dropping out of the labour market than before, for a variety of reasons including the impact of the pandemic on women’s working patterns, unaffordable childcare and healthcare problems, such as lack of support with menopause at work. There has been an explosion in insecure work, with zero-hour contracts and fire and rehire particularly impacting the lowest paid workers, especially Black, Asian and ethnic minority workers. There are more children, especially Black and working-class children, growing up in poverty, and more disabled people struggling to make ends meet. For the first time in decades, life expectancy is going backwards within some communities in our country … The number of women dying in childbirth is rising, and Black women are four times more likely to lose their lives giving birth than white women. Disturbingly, Black children are currently three times more likely to die in infancy than white children, their rates of infant mortality having increased over recent times, rather than continuing to fall as was previously the norm. And the extent of hate crime has increased over time, with violent hate crime also increasing as a proportion of overall hate crime reports.  And she says “the Conservatives’ commitment to equality extends only as far as they can use equalities issues to stoke political division”. As an example, she cites Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, saying his party will fight the next election on “a mix of culture wars and trans debate”.  Updated at 5.36pm GMT    5.24pm GMT   Cooper interrupts Pursglove and asks him to confirm that the number of asylum seekers in hotels is 20% higher now than a year ago, when Rishi Sunak said they wanted to stop hotels being used by asylum seekers. And she asks Pursglove to confirm that daily costs have risen from £6m to £8m. Pursglove ignores the question and just says the government is stopping the use of hotels for asylum seekers.  Updated at 5.32pm GMT    5.24pm GMT   Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, is responding in the debate on behalf of the government. He claims to be glad Labour called this debate. He says it allows him to explain that the government has a plan to tackle illegal migration. Labour doesn’t have a plan, he says.     5.19pm GMT   Cooper says Labour would set up a new unit to return people who come to the UK and do not qualify for asylum. But the UK could continue to do its bit for people facing persecution, she says. She says Labour wants a properly controlled asylum system. Under the Tories there is just chaos, she says. And five broken promises on asylum from the PM, she says. She urges Tory MPs to back Labour in wanting to get the truth about the government’s Rwanda policy.     5.14pm GMT   Tim Loughton (Con) asks Cooper what Labour would do about asylum seekers arriving in the UK from countries such as Iran, where returns agreements are not possible. Cooper says people from countries like that tend to be given asylum anyway.  Updated at 5.33pm GMT    5.10pm GMT   Cooper says under the Illegal Migration Act people who arrived in the UK after July 2023 should be removed from the country. That provision has not been enacted, but the government says it intends to implement this. She says there are more than 30,000 people in this category. She says, at the rate deportations are planned, it would take years for these people to be sent to Rwanda. She suggests that, in practice, there will be an amnesty. But the government is not being honest about this with its MPs, he says.     5.07pm GMT   In the Commons James Daly asks Cooper if Labour would allow asylum applications to be processed offshore in Turkey. Cooper says she is not sure what proposal Daly is referring to. She says currently if someone was in Turkey and applied to come to the UK under the refugee scheme for Ukrainians, their application would be processed offshore.  Updated at 5.34pm GMT    5.00pm GMT   Cooper says she does not accept the government’s argument that it cannot publish full details of the future costs of the Rwanda plan because they are covered by commercial confidentiality. She says the government has published the future costs of its deal with France.     4.56pm GMT  Yvette Cooper says reports saying Sunak privately thinks Rwanda plan won't work show why full costs must be published  In the Commons MPs have just voted on the Labour motion criticising the government’s record on dentistry. It was defeated. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is opening the next debate on the “humble address” motion that, if passed, would oblige the government to publish confidential documents about the cost of the Rwanda programme. The text of the motion is here. Cooper says it is particularly important for these papers to be published given the reports saying Rishi Sunak never backed the plan in the first place. She is referring to the recent leaks. “You can see it in his face that he does not support it,” she says. (See 11.27am.) She says the only deterrent Sunak is interested in is deterring his backbenchers from getting rid of him.  Updated at 7.23pm GMT    4.39pm GMT  Cameron dismisses claim his role in UK-China investment fund was boosting Beijing's influence, saying project never took off  Brendan O’Hara asks Cameron about this line in the report on China published by the intelligence and security committee last year. The ISC said:  We know that China invests in political influence, and we question whether – with high-profile cases such as David Cameron (UK–China Fund), Sir Danny Alexander (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank), Lord Heseltine (The 48 Group Club) and HMG’s former chief information officer, John Suffolk (Huawei) – a similar situation might be arising in relation to China … Targets are not necessarily limited to serving politicians either. They can include former political figures, if they are sufficiently high profile. For example, it is possible that David Cameron’s role as vice-president of a £1bn China–UK investment fund (itself an initiative of Lord Chadlington), and Sir Danny Alexander’s February 2016 appointment as vice-president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), were in some part engineered by the Chinese state to lend credibility to Chinese investment, as well as to the broader China brand.  Q: Do you agree with that? Cameron say he might have done if the UK-China fund had ever got off the ground. But it didn’t. Alicia Kearns, the committee chair, asks Cameron about his support for a Chinese-backed development in Sri Lanka. Cameron says he was doing this to help Sri Lanka. The hearing has now finished.  Updated at 4.44pm GMT    4.29pm GMT   Back at the foreign affairs committee, David Cameron is being asked about China, and his hopes when he was prime minister to improve relations between China and UK. Cameron says “a lot has changed” since then. He cites developments in Hong Kong, and the persecution of Uyghurs. But he says the UK still needs to engage with China. Graham Stringer (Lab) says the Foreign Office was resistant to the government’s new, firmer approach to China. Cameron says he is not sure the Foreign Office ever fully believed in the policy he and George Osborne were adopting. On Huawei, he says this was one issue where he asked for a proper briefing to explain why the government reversed its policy after he left. (When he was PM, the government was encouraging Huawei to invest in the UK’s 5G network. Then the government decided the firm’s technology must be taken out of that network.) Cameron suggests he cannot discuss all the details in public. But he says he was persuaded the situation had changed.  Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.01pm GMT  Scottish government considering pardon scheme for Scots affected by Post Office Horizon scandal, MSPs told  The Scottish government is looking at “the idea of a pardon scheme” for sub-post office operators affected by the Horizon scandal, Angela Constance, the justice secretary has said. PA Media says: The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) – the body tasked with assessing possible miscarriages of justice – has already sent seven such cases to the appeal court, two of which have resulted in overturned convictions, Constance said in Holyrood today. But she added: “We are, however, looking at what more can be done. We are looking at the idea of a pardon scheme.” In answer to Fergus Ewing, an SNP MSP, Constance said the government had “an open mind to the best way forward”, adding that the SCCRC had proactively sought out those who may have been wrongfully convicted in 2020. Constance added that she is aware of the UK-wide compensation scheme which requires an appeal court to overturn a conviction before money can be paid out, and that she has written to UK justice secretary, Alex Chalk, to see “how best we can work together”. Scottish Tory MSP Russell Findlay told MSPs that the first minister, Humza Yousaf, had not had any meetings relating to the Horizon scandal during his time as justice secretary. Constance said she would work “collaboratively to ensure that everyone effected in Scotland can access justice and right a wrong where that has (been) done”. But she went on to accuse Findlay of seeking to “overly politicise this matter when this problem has been in the making since 1999”.  Updated at 4.10pm GMT    3.48pm GMT   Cameron praises Gordon Brown’s “brilliant” article in the Guardian today about the need to restart the Middle East peace process. Here is the article.   Related: In 2008, we were inches from peace in the Middle East. I believe it’s still within our grasp | Gordon Brown   And here is an extract. Brown says:  Recent events have also made it clear that the west – in particular the US – cannot now succeed in any peace initiative by acting on its own. It needs to work with the rest of the world, building the widest possible global coalition designed to isolate those most opposed today to a two-state solution: the murderous Hamas and the reactionary clique surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu. The consequences of doing nothing are too painful to contemplate, not just for Gaza but for the peace of the entire region. One year from now, ceasefire or not, hundreds of thousands of displaced, starving and sick Palestinians could be stranded in overcrowded refugee camps besides rubble-strewn alleyways, hollowed-out buildings and bombed-out infrastructure with no end in sight, and the cycle of violence will threaten to escalate yet again to engulf the region, entrapping a new generation of disaffected young people, who will be easy fodder for recruitment into a Hamas 2.0. Breakthroughs in geopolitics are rare, but in the least propitious of circumstances – as I argued to the Saudis and Israelis in 2008 – Kennedy and Khrushchev delivered the first ever nuclear test ban treaty, and Reagan and Gorbachev negotiated the biggest reduction of nuclear weapons in history. The year 2024 starts in deep gloom – but with visionary leadership, building upon the 2007-08 plan, there could be light at the end of a very dark tunnel that still threatens, unless we act, to turn pitch black.      3.39pm GMT  Cameron says South Africa wrong to bring case against Israel at ICJ alleging genocide in Gaza  As Patrick Wintour reports, David Cameron told the foreign affairs committee he thought South Africa was wrong to bring a case againt Israel at the international court of justice alleging genocide in Gaza.  David Cameron on South Africa genocide case at ICJ: “I don’t think it is helpful. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it is right. I don’t think we should bandy around terms like genocide. It is for the courts to define genocide not states. Our view is that Israel has a right to defend itself.”   David Cameron on South Africa genocide case at ICJ \"I don't think it is helpful.

Our view is that Israel has a right…— Patrick Wintour (@patrickwintour) January 9, 2024   Updated at 8.09pm GMT    3.31pm GMT   Bob Seely (Con) tells Cameron what he thinks Cameron is saying is that, although the Foreign Office lawyers are not saying Israel has definitely broken international law, he thinks they are telling Cameron that Israel would be vulnerable to a legal challenge on this. Cameron accepts this. He says:  The advice has been so far, that they have the commitment, the capability and the compliance [ie, the stated intention to comply with international law, and the means to ensure this happens] but on lots of occasions that is under question.       3.26pm GMT  Cameron repeatedly refuses to say whether Foreign Office laywers have told him Israel is breaking international law  Brendan O’Hara (SNP) asks if Cameron has been shown any evidence saying Israel has breached international law. Cameron says he has seen evidence that is concerning. He has to take legal advice. He says he needs to do this to approve arms exports. Q: Have you been given advice saying Israel has broken international law in the Gaza conflict? Cameron says he is not a lawyer; it is not for him to give legal advice. He says he sees lots of things where he needs to ask, is that in line with international law? Questions are put to the Israel. Based on that, he gets advice. And that decides what he will decide in relation to arms imports. Q: Isn’t turning Gaza’s water supply off a breach of international law? Cameron says they should turn the water back on. Q: But is turning it off a breach of international law? Cameron says he is not a lawyer. You do not need to be a lawyer to tell people to turn water on. Alicia Kearns asks Sir Philip Barton to confirm that occupying powers have an obligation to provide water. Barton says that is an legal matter. He presumes Kearns is correct. Q: So that is a duty for an occupying power? Yes, says Barton. But he says whether Israel is an occupying power is another matter. Kearns asks Cameron about the legal advice he has received. Cameron says the UK has not changed its arms exports Q: So you have never had advice from a Foreign Office lawyer saying Israel is in breach of international law? Cameron says he cannot recall every piece of paper put in front of him. He does not want to answer that question.  The reason for not answering this question, I cannot recall every single bit of paper that has been put in front of me. I look at everything. Of course, there are a lot of things that have happened where you think surely that was something that shouldn’t have happened.  Q: But as PM you were willing to say other countries had broken international law. Cameron says those were different cases. Q: But the principle is the same. Cameron says, if he is being asked if he is worried that Israel might have broken international law, he is willing to say he has been. He asks questions every day. O’Hara tries again. Q: Have you received legal advice saying Israel is in breach of international law? Cameron says the short answer is no. But he says the process is not that simple. He says the questions always need exploration. He asks if that is a helpful answer. No, says O’Hara. UPDATE: Léonie Chao-Fong has more on this exchange on our Israel-Hamas live blog. She says Cameron acknowledged that he had seen things regarding the conflict that have been “deeply concerning”, but said it was not his job to make a “legal adjudication”. Cameron said:  Am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law, because this particular premises has been bombed, or whatever? Yes, of course.   Updated at 4.15pm GMT    3.14pm GMT   Back at the foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns, the chair, asks Cameron if the UK has asked to see Israel’s targeting policy in Gaza. Cameron says he has not seen it, or asked to see it. He says he does not think Israel would share that. He says the Israelis say their collateral damage figures are similar to those in other equivalent conflicts. Kearns says the UK normally operates on a collateral damage rate of 3%. She says, based on the 2014 Gaza conflict, Israel may be operating at a rate closer to 20%. She asks Cameron if he has asked the Israelis what their rate is in this conflict. Cameron says he has been given figures. He says he always urges the Israelis to make those numbers lower.  Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.09pm GMT  Labour claims number of people doing DIY dentistry because of poor NHS access is 'moral outrage'  The government has left the country “toothless” amid a crisis in NHS dental care access, Wes Streeting has claimed. As PA Media reports, Streeting made the claim as he opened a Labour debate on dentistry. PA says:  The shadow health secretary said the number of people now attempting DIY dentistry is a “moral outrage”, as he opened a Labour-led Commons debate on the lack of dental care available through the NHS. Streeting also fired a warning shot towards opponents of Labour’s plans to fund dental reform by scrapping the non-domiciled tax status, claiming that the party would “quote their arguments back at them” in campaign leaflets during election year. He told MPs: “Politics is about choices. Labour chooses to rescue NHS dentistry, not give the wealthiest a tax break. Labour’s plan is fully costed, fully funded and will make a real difference to people across the country. The Tories have left our country toothless, Labour will give our country its smile back and give its NHS back too.” Streeting said tooth decay was “now the number one reason children aged six to 10 end up in hospital”, adding: “And we face the moral outrage of one in 10 Brits … saying they have been forced to attempt dentistry themselves because the NHS wasn’t there for them when they needed it. This is Dickensian. DIY dentistry in 21st century Britain. Is there any greater example of the decline this country has been subjected to under the Conservatives?” He claimed Labour would fund NHS dentistry changes through scrapping the non-dom status in order to raise extra tax revenue. The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, told MPs she was “determined to fix these issues” with NHS dentistry “so that anyone who needs to, can always see an NHS dentist no matter where they live in the country”. She also said Labour’s plans to scrap the non-dom status could affect the number of foreign workers recruited to the NHS. Atkins said: “As our economy grows, we on this side of the house want to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to work in our NHS, to work in our tech sector, to work in our life sciences industry, to work in our movie industry – which we may know just filmed Barbie this year – and many other industries that are thriving. Labour, however, apparently wants to shut the door through taxing such people on earnings they make outside the UK. I speak of course of the non-domiciled tax status.” The health secretary, formerly a Treasury minister, said non-dom taxpayers paid £8bn in UK taxes on their UK earnings last year. She added: “That is equivalent to more than 230,000 nurses. Labour wants to put that at risk and put the UK at a disadvantage in the highly paid, highly competitive, highly mobile international labour market.”   Updated at 3.16pm GMT    3.06pm GMT  Two Britons still being held hostage in Gaza, Cameron tells MPs  David Cameron says two Britons are still being held hostage in Gaza. Asked if they are still alive, he says he does not want to say any more. And he says there are other hostages who are “very connected to Britain”. Asked how many British hostages have already been returned, Cameron says he does not have that figure. Alicia Kearns (Con) says when the committee asked a similar question to an American diplomat, they could give a figure easily, and provide names too. When pressed again, Cameron says he thinks there have been no British hostages who have been brought home. But there might be people released who are connected to Britain, he suggests.  Updated at 3.12pm GMT    2.58pm GMT   Back at the foreign affairs committee, David Cameron says countries calling for a ceasefire in Gaza now need to explain how that would get rid of Hamas’s ability to fire more rockets at Israel. The UK wants a “sustainable ceasefire”, he says. That would mean Hamas no longer being able to continue rocket attacks. He says he wants a sustainable ceasefire as soon as possible. Alicia Kearns (Con) asks Cameron to confirm that the UK considers Israel an occupying power in Gaza. Cameron says he would need to take legal advice on that. Kearns says she thinks the Foreign Office does view Israel as the occupying power. Sir Philip Barton, the permanent secretary, who is giving evidence with Cameron, says the Foreign Office refers to Gaza and the West Bank as occupied territories. Cameron says there is an issue as to whether it is a military occupier. Whatever the de jure situation, Israel is the de facto occupier, he says. But he stresses that he does not consider himself as giving a legal definition because he is not a lawyer.  Updated at 3.58pm GMT    2.49pm GMT  Some pupils face detention because they don't have devices or broadband needed for digital homework, MPs told  Pupils are being given detentions after failing to complete online homework because their parents cannot afford the digital devices or broadband required, MPs have been told. The Commons education select committee was told on Tuesday that the shift to online learning during Covid had not solved the problem of digital poverty for many families in England. Elizabeth Anderson, the chief executive of the Learning Foundation and the Digital Poverty Alliance, said recent research by Deloitte had shown that one in five children still lack access to a device that’s suitable for learning. The problem is likely to be compounded as parents struggling in the cost of living crisis are resorting to cutting off their broadband in order to try to save money, the committee was told. The issue is likely to become even more critical as national examinations gradually move online, putting children who do not have proper access to a digital device with a keyboard – rather than just a smartphone – at a disadvantage, the committee heard. Anderson told the MPs:  Whether it’s remote learning or homework, more and more the expectation is you cannot complete that with pen and paper, you can only complete that online. We regularly hear about children who are receiving regular detentions because their parents can’t afford to provide them with the tools they need to do that.   Updated at 3.49pm GMT    2.43pm GMT   Cameron says he has set out five priorities for his time as foreign secretary: 1) supporting Ukraine; 2) a more stable Middle East; 3) enhancing UK security; 4) promoting international development; and 5) delivering jobs and prosperity. Fabian Hamilton (Lab) asks what Cameron feels about the decision to cut the aid budget and merge the Deparment for International Development with the Foreign Office. Cameron confirms that he was opposed to the decision to cut the aid budget. But he says he abides by collective responsibility. Politics is a team sport, he says. He says he was happy to accept this as part of agreeing to do the job. UPDATE: Cameron said:  I said at the time I was disappointed when we went away from the 0.7% … but I said to the Prime Minister when he asked me to do this job that I would accept fully Cabinet collective responsibility and I will work with what we have now, and try to make sure we have the best possible joined-up policy of diplomacy and aid, and make the very most of the 0.5% we have. Politics is a team enterprise, you can’t always get everything you want.   Updated at 4.07pm GMT    2.35pm GMT   The hearing is starting. Alicia Kearns (Con), the committee chair, says the session will run for two hours. They will spend the first hour on Gaza, she says. And then they will cover Ukraine, China, the Balkans, hostage taking, and other issues. David Cameron says his overall aim is to enhance Britain’s security and to maximise chances for prosperity. Q: Why did you take the job? Cameron says it was because he believes in public service.     2.28pm GMT  David Cameron gives evidence to Commons foreign affairs committee  David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is about to give evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee. This is what the committee has said in a news release about the subjects being discussed.  The committee is likely to explore Lord Cameron’s approach to the role; examine his broader vision and strategy for the UK’s foreign policy, as well as scrutinise his long-term priorities for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The committee is also likely to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and the UK’s engagement with the Middle East and north Africa. The committee may also examine the future of the UK’s relationship with China.   Updated at 3.49pm GMT    2.24pm GMT   More than 1.2 million people have signed the online petition hosted by the 38 Degrees website saying Paula Vennells should lose her CBE. But it was set up three years ago, and until 1 January, when the first episode of Mr Bates vs The Post Office was broadcast, it only had 1,000 signatures. The ITV drama led to it taking off. Robin Priestley, campaigns director at 38 Degrees, said Vennells’ decision to hand back her honour was “an incredible example of people power in action”. And, in a statement issued by 38 Degrees, David Smith, a former software developer who set up the petition, said:  To me, the removal of the CBE is just the start. The ultimate goal is for the sub-postmasters to get the justice they deserve. In many ways, this is symbolic, but it is a massive symbol.  What I’m hoping is that as soon as somebody as senior as her is held accountable at this level, it will start a domino effect that will lead to the justice and compensation that everyone affected deserves.      1.59pm GMT   Responding to the news that former Post Office boss Paula Vennells has handed back her CBE (see 1.09pm), the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader Daisy Cooper said:  Paula Vennells is right to hand back her CBE, but the Conservatives still need to explain why they gave it to her in the first place in 2019, along with a plum job at the top of the Cabinet Office. Oliver Dowden needs to explain why he failed to sack Paula Vennells as a Cabinet Office director when the high court judgment was handed down in 2019, exposing her full involvement in the Horizon scandal.      1.47pm GMT  Chalk says he will consider case for making cuckooing a specific offence  Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has said the government will consider making cuckooing an offence. Cuckooing is when criminals take over the home of a vulnerable person, for example, someone with learning difficulties, so they can use it for criminal purposes. During justice questions, in response to a question from Julie Marson (Con), who said cuckooing was not a victimless crime and asked if it could be made an offence, Chalk replied:  We have held a stakeholder engagement exercise on this issue … and the exercise reveals that there are civil orders and criminal offences which are available to disrupt it. It might be, for example, that the underlying offence is a possession of drugs with intent to supply, it might be possession of firearms, there could be common assault etc. But I do think this is worthy of further consideration, so I would invite a conversation with [Marson] in due course.   Updated at 1.54pm GMT    1.40pm GMT   Downing Street has hinted that Fujitsu’s role in the Post Office Horizon scandal (it provided the flawed IT) may stop it getting or keeping other government contracts. At the morning lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said:  In general, we consider companies’ conduct as part of the formal procurement process. So once the full facts have been established by the inquiry, we will make further judgments but it’s important we allow that process to take place.  Existing contracts are also kept under review, he added.     1.31pm GMT  Phillipson says Labour will use Osborne ploy to stop parents avoiding VAT on private schools by paying in advance  Labour could draw on changes to VAT introduced by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne in order to block wealthy parents from dodging its planned tax on private schools, PA Media reports. PA says:  Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the party would ensure new legislation leaves no loopholes for people to avoid paying the money if it wins the general election this year. Education leaders have suggested that parents could sidestep some extra costs from Labour’s plan to abolish tax exemption for private schools by paying for years of schooling in advance. In a speech at the Centre for Social Justice, Phillipson said: “We would make sure that the legislation is drawn in such a way to ensure that avoidance can’t take place. There is precedent for that. Back in 2010, George Osborne, when he made VAT changes, did something very similar. “So we’re clear there was precedent when the legislation was drawn in such a way that it is effective in raising the money that we need to invest in our state schools.”   Updated at 2.13pm GMT    1.21pm GMT  Government sets Tuesday and Wednesday next week as dates for showdown with Tory rebels over Rwanda bill votes  Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has announced that MPs will debate the remaining stages of the Rwanda bill, the legislation intended to ensure deportations to Rwanda can go ahead, on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. There will be six hours of debate each day. The bill will considered by a committee of the whole house, meaning all MPs can contribute to the committee stage debates which are normally limited to members of a bill committee, and these are the debates where Tory rightwingers will try to toughen the bill. For example, they may try to remove the clause in the bill allowing individuals to appeal against deportation, or to include provisions saying ministers should ignore European court of human rights injunctions stopping deportations flights. Tory centrists may also try to amend the bill to tighten the requirement on ministers to obey the European convention on human rights. Mordaunt normally announces the following week’s Commons business in a statement on Thursdays, but today she made her announcement on a point of order. Asked why she was doing it early, Mordaunt replied:  If I had waited to announce this for the first time on Thursday there would have been very limited time for people to table amendments ahead of the normal tabling deadline.   Updated at 5.01pm GMT    1.14pm GMT   Yesterday Downing Street said Rishi Sunak would “strongly support” the honours forfeiture committee “if they were to choose to investigate” the CBE awarded to Paula Vennells with a view to removing it. The committee is independent, and so Sunak does not have the power to decide for himself that an honour should be removed. But with many other people calling for Vennells to be stripped of her honour, including 1.2 million people who have signed an online petition, Vennells may have decided that if she did not give it back voluntarily, she was going to have it taken away from her anyway.  Updated at 1.23pm GMT    1.09pm GMT  Former Post Office boss Paula Vennells says she is returning her CBE  in response to protests about Horizon scandal  Paula Vennells, the former Post Office boss, has announced that she is giving back her CBE in response to the controversy about the unsafe Horizon convictions. In a statement to PA Media she said:  I continue to support and focus on co-operating with the inquiry and expect to be giving evidence in the coming months. I have so far maintained my silence as I considered it inappropriate to comment publicly while the inquiry remains ongoing and before I have provided my oral evidence. I am, however, aware of the calls from sub-postmasters and others to return my CBE. I have listened and I confirm that I return my CBE with immediate effect. I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the subpostmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system. I now intend to continue to focus on assisting the inquiry and will not make any further public comment until it has concluded.   Updated at 1.14pm GMT    12.53pm GMT  Chalk says 'truly exceptional' Post Office scandal like Guildford Four or Birmingham Six - but with hundreds of victims  Sir Robert Buckland, the Tory former justice secretary, also asked Alex Chalk to consider legislating to quash the Post Office Horizon convictions. In his reply, Chalk said an exceptional measures was needed. He told MPs:  These were truly exceptional circumstances. When I was a backbencher, I was on the record as saying this is the most serious miscarriage of justice since the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. But the clue is there were four in the Guildford case, there were six in the Birmingham case. We are talking about hundreds. It is truly exceptional, it is truly unprecedented, and it will need an appropriate resolution.  And Sir Bob Neill, the Tory chair of the Commons justice committee, said that if the government were to publish a bill to quash all the Post Office convictions, Chalk should check with senior judges to ensure they agree that the normal means for speeding up and grouping appeals could not deliver justice within an “acceptable timeframe”. Chalk agreed. He said the government respected the judiciary, and would only legislate if it had exhausted all alternatives.  Updated at 5.02pm GMT    12.37pm GMT  Justice secretary Alex Chalk hints he is close to announcing bill to quash outstanding Post Office Horizon convictions  Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has told MPs that he is considering bringing a bill to parliament to quash the unsafe Post Office Horizon convictions that remain unsafe. He was responding to a question from Nadhim Zahawi, the former Tory cabinet minister, who said there were 800 unsafe convictions that have not yet been overturned. He urged Chalk to bring forward a “simple bill” to quash those convictions. Chalk said Zahawi had put his finger on the problem “with his customary precision”. He went on:  The suggestion he made is receiving active consideration. I expect to be able to make further announcements shortly.

Substance also interesting.— Warwick Mansell (@warwickmansell) January 9, 2024   Returning from @bphillipsonMP‘s speech on education. Interesting to see room so packed, with quite a few prominent ed figures in audience. Sense of government in waiting, perhaps. Substance also interesting.   Lots of angles, which will write about. BP praised Michael Gove’s energy and sense that ed was at centre of nat conversation, which had been lost, tho stressed twice she often disagreed with him on detail.Labour refocusing on poverty alongside ed would be back to pre-MG approach.   Also interesting to hear Kevan Collins say that big element of his post-covid plan which had been rejected by government had been support for children’s social needs, post-pandemic.Really significant dimension,that has got lost? Not seen point about his plan reported before...(?)   BP also stressed need for ed to support children’s emotional needs, as children’s don’t learn well if unhappy. Huge issue in cases I follow.   Updated at 12.37pm GMT    12.23pm GMT  Bridget Phillipson says Labour would give pupils single number for education records, as with NHS  Here are some more lines from Bridget Phillipson’s speech and Q&A this morning.  Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said keeping schools open should be a priority if a future pandemic ever required another lockdown. She said:   When the government first reopened schools for most of our children, the pubs had already been open for weeks. That was entirely the wrong way around. And I tell you today, that if I’m secretary of state for education, if and when such a national crisis comes again, school should be the last to close and the first to open.  This is a response to the Tory attack line on education. Last night, in response to the advance briefing about Phillipson’s speech, CCHQ issued a statement from Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, saying: “We’re not going to take any lectures from Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour party, which fought tooth and nail to keep schools closed longer during the pandemic.”  Phillipson said the fact that Gavin Williamson, the former education secretary, did not give evidence to the Covid inquiry in person showed how schools were sidelined by the government. She said:   It says a lot that the Covid inquiry isn’t even taking evidence from Sir Gavin Williamson. I don’t blame them because he wasn’t important. The education secretary – he wasn’t at the table. Ministers failed our children in their greatest hour of need.   She condemned parents who take their children out of school for holidays, saying that was a sign of disrespect. She said:   Cheaper holidays, birthday treats, not fancying it today – these are no excuses for missing school. Penalties must be part of the system, but they can never be the answer alone. Allowing your child to skip school without good reason shouldn’t just be cause for a fine. It’s deeper. It’s a mark of disrespect for the children, the teachers, the school. Because absences hurt not just the children missing, but the children there.   She said Labour would introduce a single number, like the NHS number, to hold children’s records across different services together. She said:   Labour will bring a simple single number, like the NHS number that holds records together and that stops children’s needs falling between the gaps within schools and between them, between all of the services that wrap around them. That linkage allows us not just to support children with the issues that they face today, but to help identify the challenges of tomorrow.   She said Labour would “always be the party of family”.   She suggested Labour would take steps to ensure parents cannot avoid paying VAT on private schools fees by paying all fees in advance. This is from the BBC’s education editor, Branwen Jeffreys.

Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.27am GMT  Sunak hit by further leak that seems intended to undermine his standing with Tory MPs on Rwanda and immigration  There have been a couple of stories recently, based on leaks, that seem intended to undermine Rishi Sunak’s standing with Tory MPs on immigration. On Saturday the BBC said it had seen No 10 papers from 2021 suggesting that Sunak had doubts about the Rwanda policy. And yesterday the Sun published a story saying Sunak considered dropping the policy altogether when he was running for Tory leader in 2022. Sunak did not explicitly deny it. And today another story in this vein is in the Times. Matt Dathan and Geradline Scott say Sunak overruled Home Office plans to close dozens more hotels used by asylum seekers last autumn. They say as a result the government is paying £1.5m per day for empty beds. They write:  In October the Home Office drew up proposals to close 100 hotels by January but the prime minister ordered the target to be scaled down to 50. Downing Street feared that the government would be forced to reopen hotels this summer in the event of a surge of migrant crossings, which would damage Sunak politically before the general election. However, a Home Office insider said it exposed Sunak’s “lack of faith” in the Rwanda policy acting as a deterrent. “No 10 had a low expectation of Rwanda working so they wanted to maintain hotel space and held us back from closing more,” a source said.  A government spokesperson told the Times they did not recognise the claims – a phrase often interpreted in Whitehall as meaning that the facts are essentially true, but that spokesperson contests the way they are being interpreted. MPs are expected to resume next week the debate on the bill intended to ensure deportations to Rwanda can go ahead and rightwing Tories want to toughen it up to make legal challenges to the policy even harder. Sunak is resisting their demands, and if the leaks are deliberate, and not just the product of journalistic enterprise, they may be intended to pressurise him into backing down.  Updated at 11.38am GMT    10.58am GMT  Former education recovery commissioner backs Labour's plan to tackle persistent school absences  Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, has been giving a speech this morning about Labour’s plans to tackle persistent absence in schools. Sally Weale has a story about the main points here.   Related: Labour plans to tackle school absence in England with home-school register   At the event this morning Phillipson was introduced and endorsed by Sir Kevan Collins, who was education recovery commissioner for the government until he resigned after Boris Johnson refused to back his call for a £15bn investment to help pupils recover from the impact of Covid on learning. The Johnson government proposed spending £1.4bn instead. Collins said:  Covid revealed the best and worst of our system: teachers performed heroically as they turned on a sixpence to deliver online learning, parents leant in to support their children’s learning as never before and our children displayed resilience and determination to continue their studies. However, too many of our children are still living with the impact of the disruption. The failure to re-engage and return to established norms is seen in the collapse in school attendance. For too many children the habit and convention of going to school every day has been broken. Tackling the crisis of persistent absence must therefore be a priority and the national response must measure up to the scale of the local challenge. It demands a shared endeavour. Education standards should always take top priority. I’m excited by Bridget’s ambition for our education system and her determination to raise standards and improve outcomes for all our children.      10.37am GMT  Why government postponed last night's planned vote on oil and gas bill  A reader asks:  There was a lot of press in advance of the oil & gas licensing reaching the Commons yesterday, but I cannot see any report of what happened. Can you fill us in?  The government cancelled the debate (the second reading of the offshore petroleum licensing bill) at short notice. But that wasn’t because they were worried about being defeated. It was because there were four statements or UQs beforehand (on Gaza, the NHS, flooding and the Post Office scandal) and two of them went on for much longer than usual because so many MPs wanted to speak (Gaza and the Post Office – the Post Office one went on for more than two hours). So, by the time the second reading debate was due to start, at 9.13pm, there was only 47 minutes left for the debate. It is being rescheduled, and is due to take place within the next two weeks.  Updated at 10.56am GMT    10.18am GMT  Ed Davey has 'big questions' to answer about his role in Post Office Horizon scandal, Mel Stride says  During his interview round this morning Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, became the latest Tory to put pressure on Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, over the scandal. Asked about Davey’s involvement, he said there were “big questions” for Davey to answer “which he’s being asked in a very robust way”. Stride added: “I think it’s for him to answer those challenges.” In an interview with Pippa Crerar yesterday, Davey defended his record while he was minister for postal services from 2010 to 2012 in the coalition government. He said Post Office managers covered up what was happening with “a conspiracy of lies”.   Related: Ed Davey attacks Post Office ‘conspiracy of lies’ as he defends role in scandal       9.39am GMT  Labour to hold vote calling for release of Rwanda deportation plan documents  Labour has tabled a motion for a vote in parliament today calling for the release of documents relating to the UK government’s Rwanda deportation policy. Here is the story.   Related: Labour to table vote calling for release of Rwanda deportation plan documents       9.37am GMT   Ministers have been arriving in Downing Street for cabinet this morning. Here are some of the arrival pictures.  Updated at 9.41am GMT    9.26am GMT  Fujitsu may have to pay compensation for flawed IT behind Post Office Horizon scandal, says minister  Good morning. Cabinet is meeting for the first time this year and, among its other problems, the government is still under pressure to announce something definitive about the Post Office Horizon scandal that will show it is responding to the outrage generated by the ITV drama about the case. The drama, of course, did not reveal anything new about the scandal, which has been seen as a colossal miscarriage of justice for years and already outraged most people who took an interest. But TV turbocharged the sense of injustice, brought in a much wider audience and plonked it on the desks of parliament and the prime minister in a way that means the pressure to “do something” is unavoidable. As Pippa Crerar reports, ministers want to find a speedy way of quashing the convictions of hundreds of post office operators.   Related: Ministers scramble to clear names of victims of Post Office Horizon scandal   Talks were taking place yesterday and Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, gave a statement to MPs at around 7pm last night. But he did not have anything definite to announce on and so Mel Stride, the work and pensions minister, has been fielding questions again on the topic during his media round this morning. He told Sky News that things were happening “hour by hour” and that an announcement was imminent.  My understanding is that [talks on quashing convictions] are happening now. So this is something that is happening hour by hour. It’s not something that’s going to happen next week. It is happening right now and we intend to move very quickly.  Stride also told LBC that Fujitsu, the company that provided the faulty Horizon IT system blamed for people being wrongly accused of stealing money, would “quite possibly” have to pay compensation. He said it would not just be the taxpayer compensating the victims.  We’ve got this public inquiry under way. One of the things it’s going to look at … is where does culpability lie? Who is responsible, who knew what when, who did things they shouldn’t have done and so on? And to the extent that that culpability rests upon the shoulders of others than government, then I think you can expect ministers to come to the appropriate conclusions. And perhaps it won’t be just the taxpayer that is on the hook for those costs.  Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10am: Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, gives a speech on school absences. As Sally Weale reports, she will say Labour would legislate for a compulsory national register of home-schooled children as part of a package of measures designed to tackle the problem of persistent absence in schools. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: MPs debate two Labour motions. The first is on dentistry and the second, which starts around 4pm, is on a motion that would force the government to publish confidential government documents about the Rwanda scheme, mostly relating to costs. 2.30pm: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is questioned by the Commons foreign affairs committee.

        "content": "Akshata Murty, the millionaire businesswoman and investor married to the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has donated her shares in the childcare company Koru Kids to charity, following concerns about whether she stood to benefit from government policies. Representatives for Murty said she had taken the decision to exit her investment after it became “an unfair distraction for the company”, adding that she wanted it to be able to “focus on its work and growth”. In August, parliament’s standards watchdog concluded that Sunak inadvertently breached parliament’s code of conduct by failing to properly declare his wife’s shareholding in Koru Kids, which stood to benefit from a government childcare policy announced in last Spring’s budget. Koru Kids, which provides childcare services, was among six private childcare providers involved in a pilot scheme proposed in the budget to incentivise people to become childminders. Daniel Greenberg, parliament’s commissioner for standards, said Sunak should have declared the shareholding when being questioned on the policy by the liaison committee of senior crossbench MPs on 28 March. Asked if he had anything to declare in relation to the scheme, he replied: “No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.” It later emerged that bosses from the company attended a Downing Street reception hours after Sunak’s appearance before the committee. Sunak then sent a letter to the committee saying he had answered the question in his capacity as prime minister, and his interest in Koru Kids had been “rightly declared” in the register for ministers. While the separate register of MPs’ interests is updated every fortnight, the register for ministers, supposedly published twice a year, had not appeared for nearly 12 months at the time. The investigation came after the Guardian discovered that the six registers published since March 2019, when Murty took a stake in the company, had no mention of it. Rachel Carrell, the CEO and founder of Koru Kids, said Murty had been one of the company’s first investors but “the media attention surrounding this investment” was obscuring its push “for greater investment and to improve access to wraparound care for families”. She added: “We need to ensure that school-age children are not left behind in any new plans that materialise from the government’s levelling up plans for childcare, without any distractions for our business.” Last September, Murty wound down her startup investment fund, months after questions were raised over its links to taxpayer-funded schemes. Murty’s venture capital fund, Catamaran Ventures UK, said its directors “have decided to liquidate the company”, according to filings at Companies House. Murty had used Catamaran Ventures UK to invest some of the vast wealth she derives from her 0.91% stake in her father’s Indian IT business, Infosys. In 2023 her holding was worth about £590m. Murty’s shares in Koru Kids were donated to the charity ShareGift in December 2023, and the company said the change would be put on the public record in due course."

        "content": "A Labour government would legislate for a compulsory national register of home-schooled children as part of a package of measures designed to tackle the problem of persistent absence in schools in England. The proposed legislation would place a legal duty on councils to keep a register of all children who are not in school, and on parents to provide information about their child’s education at home. Labour would also use artificial intelligence to identify absence trends by “joining up existing records for children and improving coordination between education, social care and the wider services that support families”. There are further plans to empower the schools inspectorate, Ofsted, to review absence as part of annual safeguarding spot-checks, as well as the introduction of evidence-based early language interventions, increased mental health support and universal free breakfast clubs to help increase attendance. Tackling historically high levels of absence since the disruption of the pandemic has become a priority issue for political leaders in what will almost certainly be a general election year, with more than a fifth (21.2%) of pupils in England “persistently absent” – missing 10% or more school sessions – across the autumn and spring terms 2022-23. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is expected to set out her plans in a speech on Tuesday, the day after the Conservatives announced their plans to tackle persistent absence, which include a further 18 school “attendance hubs” run by schools with strong attendance records who share their expertise, and a national campaign stressing the importance of attendance. Labour backed earlier government plans for a compulsory national register of home-schooled children in the 2022 schools bill, but it slipped down the agenda when the legislation was scrapped. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, has since said a register remains a priority for government, but there is no way to carry it forward. In a speech to education experts at the Centre for Social Justice, Phillipson will pledge to rebuild what she sees as the broken trust between schools, families and government under the Conservatives that has led to historic levels of absence from school and a growing attainment gap between the richest and poorest children. She will say: “The difference a Labour government will bring is clear: as in 1964, as in 1997, a party that puts children first, a government that makes education its priority. A country where education is about excellence for everyone, where schools deliver high and rising standards for all our children. “The vision Labour has for education is at once simple, and powerful. That for each of us, and for all of us, background must be no barrier to opportunity. That the future is something we shape together, not face alone. That our best days are not long gone, but yet to come.” Unions, local authorities and child protection charities have long pushed for a mandatory national register of children not in school to help keep track of them and ensure they are receiving a suitable education. Paul Whiteman, general secretary at the NAHT school leaders’ union, said: “The sooner this is delivered, the better. All education settings and parents should have a duty to provide information to local authorities, enabling them to maintain an up-to-date register.” Many in the home schooling community oppose the idea. Education Otherwise, which aims to provide support and information for families whose children are being educated outside school, said: “Yet again we see an inappropriate and frankly mangled conflation of home education and absenteeism.” In a separate announcement, state primary schools pupils in London will continue to benefit from universal free school meals after the mayor announced plans to invest a further £140m to extend the scheme to the 2024-25 academic year. The current £135m scheme feeds up to 287,000 children a day and Sadiq Khan’s office says it will save families, who are struggling with the cost of living crisis, £1,000 over the two years. Across England the government funds universal infant free school meals to pupils in reception, year 1, and year 2. Jamie Oliver, who has campaigned on school meals for years, said: “Huge kudos to Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, for extending free school meals across London for another academic year. Not only will it help families make ends meet, but evidence proves that children having access to delicious, nutritious food at school is the foundation of their wellbeing and educational success.”"

        "content": "The guest seat in Nick Ferrari’s LBC studio was bolted to the floor after Boris Johnson kept escaping off-camera in tough interviews during his tenure as mayor of London, the presenter has revealed. In an interview with Radio Times, Ferrari said the chair was now firmly attached to a plate in the studio floor so interviewees stay in shot of the webcam and avoid doing what LBC staff refer to as the “Boris bolt”. The former prime minister was regularly interviewed in a segment of Ferrari’s show called Ask Boris while he was the mayor of London between 2008 and 2016 where he would routinely make headlines with flippant comments. When challenged on tough subjects, he would mumble and roll the chair out of shot, the presenter said, which led to it being fixed in place. “That is the Boris bolt,” Ferrari said. “[When we were] doing the Ask Boris shows and he was mayor, he’d be asked why he was cancelling the 63 bus and he’d just drift off camera.” He added: “[Former commissioner of the Metropolitan police] Cressida Dick went to move her chair when she was in the studio but couldn’t. I told her off air why they were bolted in place and she said: ‘We do this in our interview rooms so our officers don’t get hit over the head with them.’” Ferrari, who previously said he was a fan of Johnson and also admitted to liking Keir Starmer, was asked whether the government got a free pass on his show. “Not at all … it’s terrible at the moment, embarrassing,” he said. “Let the voters have their say, but it won’t be so bad to have a complete change because it will refresh everything. The party looks absolutely knackered. Let’s be honest, the talent puddle has been well and truly drained. “[If Labour win the next election] it will probably mean that I can be a little bit more on the front foot and try to hit a few more sixes and fours, rather than just doing a little tickle for a couple of runs.”"

        "content": "\n 8.58pm GMT \nClosing summary\n\n\nThe government hopes to soon be able to announce measures for resolving outstanding criminal convictions in relation to the Post Office Horizon scandal, a minister has told MPs tonight. Kevin Hollinrake, the business and trade minister, told parliament that options have been “devised” for dealing with the outstanding convictions but that conversations needed to be had with senior members of the judiciary.\nHe told MPs: “All of us on these benches and across the house are united in our desire to see justice done. We have devised some options for resolving the outstanding criminal convictions with much more pace … I am confident that we should be able to implement measures that address the concerns expressed by the advisory board. I hope the government will be able to announce these proposals to the house very shortly.”\nEd Davey has accused senior Post Office managers of unleashing a “conspiracy of lies” against successive ministers as he defended – and refused to apologise for – his role in the Horizon scandal. The Liberal Democrat leader, who has been criticised for letting down victims of the miscarriage of justice as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, said the government had “dragged their feet” on overturning convictions and issuing compensation payments.\nRishi Sunak would “strongly support” the honours forfeiture committee if it decided to review the former Post Office boss Paula Vennells’ CBE after the Horizon scandal, Downing Street has said. Calls are growing for the former chief executive, who oversaw the organisation while it routinely denied there were problems with its IT system, to hand back her honour after an ITV drama returned the widespread miscarriage of justice to the spotlight. A petition demanding that the honours forfeiture committee remove Vennells’ CBE over the scandal, which has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, has already attracted more than 1 million signatures.\nThe Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has urged independence supporters to defect from the Scottish National party to “boot the Tories out” of Downing Street, as the first minister, Humza Yousaf, told wavering voters that the cost of living crisis made independence more urgent than ever. As the two leaders made their first major speeches on Monday, in what is expected to be a general election year, both made particular reference to pro-independence voters. The cohort will be essential in the coming campaign as voters previously loyal to the SNP are becoming convinced that Labour can offer more immediate solutions to soaring household bills and crumbling public services.\nRishi Sunak has refused to endorse the partner of the disgraced former Conservative MP Peter Bone to replace him as the party’s candidate in the Wellingborough byelection. Helen Harrison’s selection on Sunday has drawn controversy given the byelection was triggered after more than 10% of local voters signed a petition to recall Bone after revelations about his behaviour. Bone, who had held the seat with a majority since 2005, was recalled after the parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct.\nCentrist Conservative MPs have hit back after one of their rightwing colleagues claimed the party “faces obliteration” at the next election unless it shifts to the right. Members of the One Nation group of Tories have rejected the claims made by Danny Kruger that the party has made Britain worse during its 13 years in power and could be on course for a heavy defeat at this year’s election.\nAlok Sharma, the UK’s former business and energy secretary, will not be voting for Rishi Sunak’s oil and gas bill, criticising it as a sign the government was “not serious” about meeting its international climate commitments. The bill, due to be debated in parliament on Monday, would allow for an annual licensing regime for oil and gas exploration contracts. It has been hugely controversial among the green wing of the Conservative party – the former minister Chris Skidmore announced on Friday he would be stepping down as an MP as a result of the proposed legislation.\nLabour has vowed to reset the “broken relationship between schools and families” by tackling the crisis in pupil absences and child mental health, ahead of rival policy announcements from the party and the government this week. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, is to set out the “generational challenges” facing England’s schools and pupils in a keynote speech on Tuesday. It will come a day after the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, announces the government’s latest efforts to repair school attendance rates since the Covid pandemic.\nA medical NGO known for emergency relief in war zones is treating asylum seekers housed in a disused airbase in the James Cleverly’s constituency, the Guardian can reveal. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is offering thrice-weekly clinics to people contained by the Home Office in RAF Wethersfield, Essex, which is based in the home secretary’s Braintree constituency. It is the first time that MSF, which is known for its work in Gaza, South Sudan and Syria, has offered medical relief specifically for people seeking asylum in the UK.\nMore than 1 million people in England died prematurely in the decade after 2011 owing to a combination of poverty, austerity and Covid, according to “shocking” research by one of the UK’s leading public health experts. The figures are revealed in a study by the Institute of Health Equity at University College London led by Sir Michael Marmot. They demonstrate the extent to which stark economic and social inequalities are leading to poorer people dying early from cancer, heart problems and other diseases.\n\nThat’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along.\n\n\n\n 8.47pm GMT \n\nConservative former cabinet minister Maria Miller told the Commons: “Now is the time for the Government to consider how all convictions that relied on evidence from the Horizon system, which must now be seen as unsafe, could be quashed without victims having to endure further legal wrangling.”\nBusiness minister Kevin Hollinrake said: \n\nI share her ambition. Ideally we would like a process that does not require a convicted postmaster to come forward, something we could do across the board - that’s exactly what we’re looking at, and I hope to have some news for her in the coming days.\n\nSpeaking elsewhere in the session, he said: \n\nAn immediate overturning (of) convictions is something we’re looking to achieve as soon as possible, if that is possible, clearly subject to the caveats I said earlier in my remarks.\nDespite what clearly the Post Office has done itself, I think most members of the public still look at the Post Office... the network, with great admiration.\n\n\n\n\n 8.27pm GMT \n\nMinisters were told they should consider life sentences in prison for those found ultimately responsible for the Horizon scandal.\nLabour former minister Barry Gardiner told the Commons: \n\nThe minister said this is not just about compensation, it is about restoration, and that is true. But is it not also about misfeasance in public office? So will the minister confirm that the maximum penalty for a public servant who willingly and knowingly acts in a manner that results in harm, injury or financial loss to an innocent party is life imprisonment?\n\nBusiness minister Kevin Hollinrake replied: \n\nI have dealt with a number of different scandals over the years from the backbench as well as in my ministerial role here and I think it happens all too often at a corporate level for us to simply carry on in the way we have done in the past.\nSo I am very much happy to take away his points in terms of the potential penalty for the offence he describes. That is something I will discuss with officials and others.\n\nConservative former business minister Paul Scully, who used to oversee the government’s efforts to deal with the Horizon scandal, urged his successor to “make sure that the judiciary allow a blanket quashing of all of the convictions”.\nTory former minister Priti Patel meanwhile told Hollinrake to “review the actions and accountability of Fujitsu, and with that the culpabilities as they are still awarded contracts week after week across government”.\n\n\n\n 8.17pm GMT \n\nEd Davey has accused senior Post Office managers of unleashing a “conspiracy of lies” against successive ministers as he defended – and refused to apologise for – his role in the Horizon scandal.\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, who has been criticised for letting down victims of the miscarriage of justice as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, said the government had “dragged their feet” on overturning convictions and issuing compensation payments.\nHe also questioned why the Tories had awarded the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells a CBE in the 2019 new year honours list, even though hundreds of post office operators had launched a group action in the high court two years before.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the Lib Dem leader said his focus was on getting justice for post office operators who were prosecuted for taking money from their businesses as a result of faulty Post Office software, developed by the Japanese firm Fujitsu.\n“It’s really important that we get to the bottom of this, that we get the truth, that the people in the Post Office who were perpetrating this conspiracy of lies, that they are held to account,” he said.\n\n Related: Ed Davey attacks Post Office ‘conspiracy of lies’ as he defends role in scandal \n\n\n\n\n 8.01pm GMT \n\nConservative former minister Sir David Davis suggested there should be criminal prosecutions for the “real villains” of the Horizon scandal.\nHe told the Commons: \n\nThe government needs to do four things. It needs: to stop the Post Office unnecessarily challenging the victims’ appeals and find a more rapid method to exonerate all of the innocent victims; to instruct the Post Office to stop hiring expensive lawyers to challenge the compensations claims and therefore to accelerate the payment mechanism; to strip away the Post Office’s right to police its own cases; and to accelerate the investigatory procedures prior to criminal prosecutions of the real villains in this case - which of course are, well, we know who they are.\nDoes the minister believe he can achieve those four aims in months rather than years?\n\nBusiness minister Kevin Hollinrake replied: \n\nI can assure him on all four counts. Yes, we want a more rapid means of overturning convictions. Yes, we want to make sure the Post Office doesn’t challenge unfairly any attempt to overturn convictions. Yes, in terms of making sure the investigatory process happens more quickly.\n\nHollinrake also said the compensation schemes are not being “policed or restricted” by the Post Office.\n\n\n\n 7.53pm GMT \n\nBusiness minister Kevin Hollinrake has said it is “perfectly reasonable” to ask the former Post Office boss to hand back her CBE.\nDowning Street earlier said prime minister Rishi Sunak would “strongly support” an honours committee if it chose to look into revoking Paula Vennells’s CBE in the wake of the Horizon scandal.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Hollinrake said: \n\nAs a CEO who’s overseen the Post Office during a critical time when things went so badly wrong, I think, as a former CEO myself, I would say it’s perfectly reasonable to ask somebody to voluntarily hand back an honour in that specific situation, but that’s a matter for the person concerned.\n\n\n\n\n 7.46pm GMT \n\nHollinrake also said securing justice for the victims of the Horizon scandal and ensuring such a “tragedy” can never happen again is his “highest priority as a minister”.\nMaking a statement in the Commons, he said: \n\nWatching last week’s ITV programme has only reinforced our zeal for seeing justice done as quickly as possible.

The Post Office quite rightly decided to stop undertaking private prosecutions in 2015.\nIf we are to make sure that a scandal like this can never happen again we need to look at the way in which private prosecutions like these have been undertaken.\nAny company can bring private prosecutions in this way, this is not a special power of the Post Office.\nI know (justice secretary Alex Chalk) wants to give this issue proper and thoughtful consideration and I am sure he will report to the House about this issue in due course.\n\n\n\n\n 7.17pm GMT \n\nJonathan Reynolds, the shadow business and trade minister, has said the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office is a “powerful reminder” of how art and culture can highlight scandals, such as the Horizon scandal.\nHe said:\n\nThe Post Office prosecuted innocent people, causing an unimaginable amount of pain and suffering that no amount of compensation can ever alleviate. Yet to add insult to injury, the journey to justice for those subpostmasters has been mired by a great many delays and barriers.\n\nHe added:\n\nJustice must be served to those workers and their families and that is why Labour has called for all subpostmasters to be exonerated in full. \n\nReynolds said Labour is in support of any measures that involve the quashing of convictions that do not involve the victims having to reopen litigation.\n\n\n\n 7.08pm GMT \nGovernment has 'devised options' to deal with outstanding Horizon convictions, minister says\n\nThe government hopes to soon be able to announce measures for resolving outstanding criminal convictions in relation to the Post Office Horizon scandal, a minister has told MPs tonight.\nKevin Hollinrake, the business and trade minister, told parliament that options have been “devised” for dealing with the outstanding convictions but that conversations needed to be had with senior members of the judiciary.\nHe told MPs:\n\nThis is not just a matter of getting justice for those wrongly convicted. Overturning their convictions is also key to unlocking compensation. Each person who has a Horizon conviction overturned is entitled to an interim compensation payment of £163,000.\nThey can then choose to have their compensation individually assessed or accept an upfront offer of £600,000. That offer is already speeding along compensation for a significant number of people.\n\nHe added:\n\nAll of us on these benches and across the house are united in our desire to see justice done. We have devised some options for resolving the outstanding criminal convictions with much more pace … I am confident that we should be able to implement measures that address the concerns expressed by the advisory board.\nI hope the government will be able to announce these proposals to the house very shortly.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.19pm GMT\n\n\n 6.51pm GMT \n\nThe government must bring forward minimum service levels in hospitals to protect patients during strikes, a Conservative MP said.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Dr Caroline Johnson, the MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, and an NHS consultant who worked during the industrial action, said: \n\nMake no mistake that these strikes are causing suffering to patients, both adults and children.\nThe derogation process has not worked, as the Secretary of State says, the BMA (British Medical Association) have not returned junior doctors to work when they have been asked to, when there has been a risk of dangerous harm to patients.\nThe first duty of any government is to protect its citizens so when will the secrectary of state bring forward minimum service levels to protect the patients from these strikes?\n\nIn response, health secretary Victoria Atkins said: \n\nWe have already introduced minimum service levels for ambulance services, something that was opposed by the party opposite, but we have just closed the consultation on minimum service levels in hospitals and we are of course carefully analysing the responses.\n\n\n\n\n 6.33pm GMT \n\nLabour has accused Rishi Sunak of being “asleep at the wheel” after the prime minister claimed a pay dispute with nurses had been resolved.\nAppearing on BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Sunak said the government had reached a pay resolution with every other part of the NHS, except for junior doctors.\nSpeaking in the Commons, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting, said: \n\nIn his interview on the BBC yesterday, we saw why the prime minister allowed these strikes to go on for so long without intervening himself, he is using industrial action as an excuse for the state his party has left the NHS in after 14 years and he would rather blame NHS doctors and nurses than take a shred of responsibility himself.\n\nHe added: \n\nWhile the prime ,inister was bragging about all the parts of the NHS that aren’t currently on strike, because that’s how low he now sets the bar, he seemed to have forgotten that nurses are still in formal dispute.\n\n\n\n\n 6.16pm GMT \n\nThe government sat back and let the strikes go ahead whilst sending the NHS “naked into the winter”, Labour said.\nSpeaking in the Commons, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \n\nBefore the strikes and before the pandemic the NHS has been facing winter crisis after winter crisis, as a direct result of the Conservatives’ failure, their failure to train enough staff, their failure to arm the health service with modern technology and their failure to reform.\n\nHe added: \n\nIsn’t the truth that the Conservatives once again sent the NHS naked into the winter and patients are paying the price? Given how ill-equipped they left the NHS, and given the desperate pleas from NHS leaders for these strikes to be resolved, why on earth did the government choose to sit back and let this damaging strike action go ahead?\nNot only did the health secretary (Victoria Atkins) allow talks with the junior doctors to collapse, not only did she refuse to reopen negotiations until tomorrow when the damage will have been done, at the 11th hour as junior doctors stood on the edge of this strike action she chose to push them straight into it.\n\n\n\n\n 6.02pm GMT \n\nPaul Scully, the Conservative MP who was minister for postal services under Boris Johnson, has suggested that compensation payments to Post Office workers were held up because the Treasury dragged its feet, John Stevens reports in the Mirror.

(See 10.33am.) His colleague Lee Anderson, deputy chair of the Conservative party, is cruder and more brutal and, in an interview on GB News, he suggested that Davey was to blame for people going to jail, and even for some people taking their lives. He said:\n\nAs MPs, we often get cases come into our surgeries, into our office, and there’s always two sides to every argument and as an MP, you have to look at both sides, speak to the victims and whoever the perpetrators are, and sometimes it’s a completely different story when you get the bottom of it.\nThis man, this Ed Davey, has not really looked at both sides of the story. He took the side of the Post Office employers and sadly many went to prison due to him not listening …\nInstead of making excuses, instead of saying he was lied to, he should properly apologise, make a public apology in parliament to these people that sadly took their lives, the families of these victims, and the people who went to prison.\n\nDavey would not accept this. He has said that he did challenge Post Office management about claims that convictions were unsafe, but that managers did not tell him the truth.\n\nUpdated at 4.52pm GMT\n\n\n 4.33pm GMT \n\nThe Labour MP Jon Cruddas was on Radio 4’s Start the Week this morning talking about his new history of the Labour party, A Century of Labour. As Toby Helm reported in the Observer recently, Cruddas is quite critical of Keir Starmer in the book, arguing that “it is difficult to identify the purpose of a future Starmer government – what he seeks to accomplish beyond achieving office”.\nBut, as Cruddas made clear in his interview this morning, he also rejects the conventional leftwing argument that Starmer is just offering pastiche Blairism. In the book he says that Starmer’s interest in industrial policy and unions is more Harold Wilson than Tony Blair and he told Start the Week:\n\nA few years ago there was a lot of discussion in and around the Labour party saying the working class is over, it’s on the wrong side of history, it’s been wiped out by technological change, it doesn’t vote for us increasingly anyway, we should double down on a new demographic of urban, educated, young remainer voter. And that was the future. Technology was on its side. And that is our route to renewal.\nAnd Keir Starmer, it seems to me, under researched and reported, is actually trying to go back before New Labour, almost Wilsonian, to try and re-eestablish Labour’s relations with a discernible working class, which is a really interesting strategy because it bucks a lot of the fashionable thinking of a few year ago.\n\nCruddas also stressed his commitment to ethical socalism. Asked if he really thought it was the job of a political party to make people better human beings, Cruddas replied:\n\nYes, I think it is. But that reveals where I come in all of this. Yes I do. I think it’s incumbent on polical parties to reanimate politics itself, and reinstil a sense of ethics and morality in terms of the public conversation, and reimagine a notion of civil virtue within the process.\n\nA Century of Labour is an intellectual history of Labour, focusing on what people in the party thought it was for at various moments in the past, and he argues Labour does best when the utilitarian tradition (aiming to make people better off), the libertarian tradition (making them free-er) and the ethical tradition (making them more virtuous) are all represented in the party’s thinking. It’s a clever, thought-provoking book with the capacity to shape the way Labour thinks about its history.\nThe ethical strand favoured by Cruddas is not particularly fashionable in the party now, but – perhaps surprisingly – one person who would agree with him about the moral purpose of politics is the rightwing Conservative Danny Kruger. “I argue in this book that the purpose of politics is the cultivation of the conditions of virtue, of the moral impulses that make good conduct, and that these conditions are the normative dispositions of a conservative society,” Kruger wrote in his own book, Covenant, last year.\n\nUpdated at 4.36pm GMT\n\n\n 3.43pm GMT \nMark Drakeford suggests drivers in Wales could escape fines if they're genuinely confused about new 20mph speed limit\n\nMark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has suggested drivers will not be fined for breaching the new default 20mph speed limit in Wales if they are “genuinely confused” about the rule.\nAs PA Media reports, last year, Wales became the first country in the UK to drop the default speed limit from 30mph to 20mph in built-up areas. Enforcement of the limit begins this month.\nAt a press conference in Cardiff, asked about the risk of people being fined because the messaging was not clear, Drakeford replied:\n\nI don’t think they will be fined in those circumstances.\nI think if the police find somebody driving above 20 miles an hour and the reason is because they are genuinely confused about that, then that’s why the police will always start with education and conversation.\nI don’t think in those circumstances of genuine confusion, the police will move to enforcement.\n\nDrakeford said the policy should be “fine-tuned” and kept “under review” to ensure consistency across different local authorities throughout Wales, PA says.\nBut he also said that in cases where motorists drive “well above” the limit the law would have to be enforced.\nAsked to specify what speed would be considered “well above” 20mph, he said previous cases relating to pre-existing 20mph zones had involved people driving “closer to 30 than 20”.\n\n\n\n 3.33pm GMT \n\nPrison staff and justice officials have been told to make urgent changes in the wake of an alleged escape, PA Media reports.\nIn a Commons written statement Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, told MPs the probe he ordered into the alleged escape of prisoner Daniel Khalife from HMP Wandsworth in south London in September had concluded and that he had asked the jail, the Prison and Probation Service and the Ministry of Justice to “take forward the independent investigation’s recommendations as a matter of priority”.\n\nUpdated at 3.49pm GMT\n\n\n 3.11pm GMT \nCentrist Tories reject MP’s claim party must shift to the right\n\nCentrist Conservative MPs have hit back after one of their rightwing colleagues claimed the party “faces obliteration” at the next election unless it shifts to the right, Kiran Stacey and Aletha Adu report.\n\n Related: Centrist Tories reject MP’s claim party must shift to the right \n\n\nUpdated at 3.15pm GMT\n\n\n 3.09pm GMT \nHumza Yousaf claims Scottish households could eventually be £10,000 per year better off under independence\n\nScottish households could eventually end up being around £10,000 a year better off under independence, Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, said today.\nThe SNP leader quoted the figure, based on a Resolution Foundation report, in a speech at Glasgow University on the economy.\nYousaf said report claimed the average household would be £8,300 better off if the UK had the average income inequality of similar countries.\nApplying the same methodology to Scotland, Yousaf said:\n\nThe prize for the typical Scottish household would be even greater, they would be £10,200 better off.\nThat then, is the huge prize of independence. Not to match the performance of those independence countries overnight – no one’s suggesting that is going to happen – but to start catching so that Scotland becomes more normal.\n\nIn response to questions, Yousaf said the economic changes in an independent Scotland would not happen overnight.\n\nI’m not selling independence as being an overnight change, that somehow the day after we become independent there will be rivers of milk and honey and the manna will fall from the sky. There will be challenges, of course there will be difficulties. It will be a transitional process.\n\nBut, Yousaf said, the UK’s economic problems were “hardwired” and “systemic”.\nAs the National reports, Yousaf also proposed that an independent Scotland should have a ministry for industrial policy.\nThis is from my colleague Libby Brooks.\n\n\nOver to Glasgow University where FM Humza Yousaf is setting out his plans for industrial policy in an independent Scotland, based on rejoining EU, a government ministry to drive industrial policy and large-scale public investment pic.twitter.com/i3QdZu00vm— Libby Brooks (@libby_brooks) January 8, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.50pm GMT\n\n\n 3.09pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 2.12pm GMT \nStarmer says government's response to Storm Henk flooding 'wasn't quick enough'\n\nKeir Starmer said the government’s response to flooding is not “good enough” and vowed he would take pre-emptive action as he toured streets being cleared up after last week’s deluge, PA Media reports.

So I just don’t think it’s good enough for the government to come after the event again and express empathy. Get ahead of this with a taskforce. That’s what I would do.”\nAsked if Labour would provide more money for flood prevention, Starmer said: “Of course it does need money but the taskforce is not just about money.

Here are the main points.\n\nCable accused the Tories of trying to scapegoat Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, over the Post Office scandal. (See 10.33am.) Asked if Davey had questions to answer, Cable said:\n\n\nAll ministers who dealt with this, under the previous Labour government, and even more under our successors, the Conservative government, had dealt with this problem in the same way that Ed Davey did. He is now being highlighted. I suspect the reason is that this is election year and it’s quite good for somebody to try to make a scapegoat of a Lib Dem minister. I don’t think this is a party political matter at all.\nThere obviously is a terrible failure of governments in general and of the criminal justice system. And that’s why the independent investigation is taking place …\nTrying to find a scapegoat is an understandable, human reaction. But it’s not actually the heart of the problem.\n\n\nHe backed Keir Starmer’s call for a system to be set up to allow all convictions to be overturned en masse. (See 10.57am.) Cable said this would be justified even if it meant some guilty people being exonerated.\n\n\nHe said as business secretary he did not have the power stop the Post Office prosecutions. Ministers only had the right to make requests, he said.\n\n\nParliament had given the Post Office enormous powers not just to operate commercially, but to run a kind of private police force, a bit like the railways. There was mounting concern, I think, in the department about this, but it wasn’t at all clear what we could do to intervene.\n\nHe said the Post Office was given considerable independence so that decisions on closing individual post offices would not be matters for ministers.\n\nHe said he was only once approached by a delegation of sub-post office operators about miscarriages of justice when he was business secretary. “It wasn’t something that was constantly on the radar of me, and probably other ministers,” he said.\n\n\nHe said he was happy to apologise for what happened. Asked if he had nothing to apologise for, he replied:\n\n\nNo, I wouldn’t be so arrogant. I think any minister who’s involved in this, as I said, before our government and after it, has some responsibility … I’m very happy to apologise, as all ministers who are involved in this I think should …\nI feel a sense of responsibility that I and a lot of other people, had we known how to do it, would have intervened more actively.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.04pm GMT\n\n\n 1.25pm GMT \n\n\nUpdated at 1.27pm GMT\n\n\n 1.17pm GMT \n\nSky’s political editor, Beth Rigby, who went to the PM Connect event at Accrington but did not get called to ask a question (memo to No 10 – that’s a bad idea), says she has been told that Harry Cole’s story about Rishi Sunak wanting to advocate scrapping the Rwanda policy when he was running for Tory leader in 2022 is accurate.

He would strongly support the forfeiture committee if it chose to review the case.\nIt is a decision for the committee, rather than the government.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.01pm GMT\n\n\n 12.36pm GMT \nSunak's PM Connect event - snap verdict\n\nIn sales you have to sound enthusiastic and, if anyone landed in Accrington this morning after a four-year holiday on the planet Mars and listened to the prime minister, they might assume that all was going rather well. Rishi Sunak sounded upbeat, cheery, and positive (even though he does not have the exuberance of Boris Johnson, or urbane self-confidence of David Cameron). He came over as well briefed. And he did not get booed, as he was last week.\nBut Sunak is not addressing a country with its memory wiped clean. Voters already have a largely settled, and extremely negative, view of what Sunak’s government has achieved, and this year’s election campaign will be decided by whether Sunak can find anything to shift that. There was nothing this morning that would do the trick.\nThis was an event organised by CCHQ, not the government, which meant that Sunak had free rein to be party political. And he did attack Labour, and Keir Starmer. But, whereas CCHQ has ceaselessly been trying to make the case that Labour’s £28bn green investment plan means Starmer would have to put up taxes (Starmer says that’s nonsense), Sunak did not make that argument with any gusto and instead just settled for the rather limp attack line that Starmer “doesn’t have a plan” and just “snipes from the sidelines”. (See 11.17am.)\nThere are three problems with this: a) Starmer does have lots of plans (whether they are inspiring or effective is another matter); b) even if he didn’t, not having a plan is not hardly worst thing that can be said about an opposition; and c) sniping from the sidelines is, literally, Starmer’s job as leader of the opposition. Labour HQ will have been watching that this morning thinking: ‘Is that it?’\nSunak was contrasting Labour’s stance with his own “long-term plan”. This worked for Cameron in 2015 but, as Matthew Holehouse from the Economist points out in posts on X, there are good grounds for thinking it won’t this time.\n\n\nSounds a lot like the campaign 2015. The challenge is that in 2010-15 enough people accepted the grand Cameron story: of when and what the \"square one\" was, and that there was a \"long-term plan\". Hard to say the same today... https://t.co/CVd29wqnI0— Matthew Holehouse (@mattholehouse) January 8, 2024\n\n\n\nSounds a lot like the campaign 2015.

Hard to say the same today...\n\n\nSunak’s telling appears to date “square one” as Oct 2022, when he replaced Liz Truss. But it is not hard to see why this may be less resonant with voters than in 2015, when “square one” referred to the GFC [global financial crisis] and the last time the opposition were in power.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.20pm GMT\n\n\n 12.01pm GMT \n\nJason Groves, political editor of the Daily Mail, says Keir Starmer was much better at taking questions from the press during his Q&A last week than Rishi Sunak was today.\n\n\nSunak taking noticeably fewer qs from the press than Starmer these days. Just four media qs permitted by the PM in Lancashire today, compared with 17 fielded by Starmer on his day out in Bristol last week— Jason Groves (@JasonGroves1) January 8, 2024\n\n\nPartly that might be because the format was different; Sunak was meant to be taking questions mainly from members of the public, whereas Starmer’s event last week was just media-focused.

Making sure that children have the chance for a world-class education is the most important thing you can do, he says.\nThat is one of the things that brought him into politics, he says.\nAnd he says children in England are the best readers in the western world as a result of the government’s reform. Education is one area where he is most proud of the government’s record over the past 13 years, he says.\n\n\n\n 11.33am GMT \nSunak dismisses - but does not fully deny - report claiming he considered scrapping Rwanda plan for in summer of 2022\n\nQ: If you are so committed to the Rwanda scheme, why did you consider scrapping it when you were running for Tory leader in 2022, as the Sun reports? (See 9.57am.)\nSunak says he never said that.\n\nI didn’t say I was going to scrap it. I mean that’s completely false. Of course I didn’t.\n\n(The report did not say that he ever advocated that position – just that he privately considered it as an option.)\nHe says he addressed this in his BBC interview yesterday; he supported deterrent, but as chancellor had to scrutinise the plan.\nHe says the questions are for Labour; you will only tackle this with a deterrent, and so why are they not supporting the Rwanda bill? He says it has to be the government that decides who comes to the UK.\nUPDATE: See 11.48am and 1.17pm for more on this.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.25pm GMT\n\n\n 11.29am GMT \nSunak says he wants to speed up process of paying compensation to victims of Post Office scandal\n\nSunak is now taking questions from the media.\nQ: Why did it take an ITV drama to get your government to focus on the Post Office miscarriage of justice? And will you now quash all convictions?\nSunak says this is a scandal. But he says he predecessors started the process of putting things right. They set up the inquiry, and approved compensation. But he wants to speed up the process, he says.\nWhat happened was wrong.\n\n\n\n 11.27am GMT \n\nQ: What can you do to show us you are offering business certainty?\nSunak talks about full expensing. He says no other big economy in the world offers business such a generous tax break.\nAnd it is now permanent, he says.\nHe concedes policy did change on net zero. But he says he did that because he felt people were being forced to change too quickly. He wanted a pragmatic and proportionate approach. The UK will still get to net zero faster than other countries, he says. He says he was criticised for this, but the move was right.\nHe says we can now get to net zero “in a way that saves you money”.\n\n\n\n 11.22am GMT \n\nJames Chapman, a former political editor of the Daily Mail who worked as special adviser for David Davis when he was Brexit secretary for about a year until he left convinced that Brexit was a terrible mistake, says he does not think the “back to square one” line really works as an attack line against Labour.\n\nThe trouble with Sunak’s latest slogan is that I suspect a large number of voters think Britain is so broken under the Tories that “going back to square one” sounds like a wholly positive idea\n\n\n\nThe trouble with Sunak's latest slogan is that I suspect a large number of voters think Britain is so broken under the Tories that \"going back to square one\" sounds like a wholly positive idea https://t.co/eOdczpJkBP— James Chapman (@jameschappers) January 8, 2024\n\n\nJohn Crace makes a similar point.\n\n\nRishi Sunak thinks Labour will take us back to Square One.

That was partly because of the strikes, he said. But he said, without strikes, waiting lists could come down. And he said the government was acting to strengthen the NHS.\nOn the economy, he said inflation had halved and the national insurance cut had just taken effect.\nAnd he said Keir Starmer would just take the UK “back to square one”.\n\nHe’s been leader of the opposition for four years now. And in that time, he hasn’t said what he would do differently.\nThat’s because he does not have a plan. He just snipes from the sidelines.\nHe can’t tell you how he’s going to stop the boats because he doesn’t have a plan to do that.\nHe can’t tell you how he’s going to control welfare because he doesn’t have a plan.\nHe can’t tell you how he’s going to fund his £28bn-a-year spending spree because he doesn’t have a plan to pay for it.\nHe doesn’t have a plan for Britain because he’s more interested in political game playing and saying as little as possible to get votes.\nThat’s not my approach. I’m prepared to take the difficult decisions for the long-term benefit of our country and you saw me do that, after the pandemic, [making] a decision to reduce overseas aid given the other demands we had on our public finances, being restrained and fair on public sector pay, charting a new pragmatic course on net zero that gets us there but saves you thousands of pounds.\n\nLabour, of course, would dispute this. The party has published five missions setting out in considerable detail what policies it would implement in key areas.\n\nUpdated at 2.01pm GMT\n\n\n 11.08am GMT \n\nSunak said that, year on year, the number of people crossing the Channel on small boats was down by 35%. In the last quarter of 2023, numbers were down 50%, he said.\nHe said “the long-term solution to this problem is to have a deterrent” and that was why he wanted to pass his Rwanda bill.\nBut Labour just wanted to stop the flights to Rwanda, not stop the boats, he claimed.\nAccording to the BBC report on Saturday, government papers from 2022 recorded No 10 as thinking that Sunak’s view of the Rwanda plan at the time was “deterrent won’t work”.\n\n\n\n 11.04am GMT \nSunak claims he has 'made progress' on his five priorities as he holds first major campaign event of 2024\n\nRishi Sunak has just started his PM Connect event. He is in Accrington in Lancashire.\nHe starts by claiming he has “made progress” on the five priorities he set out last year.\n(That is not the view of expert bodies like the Institute for Government, which said last week he was likely to fail to meet three of them.)\n\n\n\n 10.57am GMT \nStarmer says government should set up scheme to allow Post Office Horizon convictions to be overturned en masse\n\nKeir Starmer has been in Loughborough to witness the impact of the recent flooding. In an interview with broadcasters, he said there were three things the government should be doing in relation to the Post Office Horizon scandal.\n\nStarmer called for a process that would allow the convictions to be overturned en masse. He said:\n\n\nThese convictions, the remaining convictions need to be looked at en masse …\nI think all the convictions need to be looked at because there’s a root cause of the problem here.\nThe government could pass legislation, so obviously we’d support that if they did.\nIt might be possible to get these cases back before the court of appeal quickly – I’ve done that when I was a prosecutor – but whichever way it’s done, these convictions need to be looked at.\n\nProf Chris Hodges, chair of the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, has also called for a collective approach to overturning convictions. He told the BBC this morning: “A civilised state should overturn these convictions and deliver compensation with people having to do as little as possible.” One option would be for parliament to pass a law pardoning or exonerating those convicted, and Hodges argued that this would not encroach on the rights of the judiciary.\n\nStarmer said prosecution powers should be taken away from the Post Office. He said:\n\n\nI think that the prosecution should be taken out of the hands of the Post Office and given to the Crown Prosecution Service. I used to run the Crown Prosecution Service, we’ve prosecuted for other departments, we can do it here – that should be done straightaway.\n\n\nAnd he said compensation needed to be paid swiftly. He said:\n\n\nCompensation needs to be paid, that’s already allocated for in the Treasury – they need to get on and pay that.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.04am GMT\n\n\n 10.33am GMT \nEd Davey needs to explain how he responded to Post Office concerns when he was minister in charge, senior Tory says\n\nThe Post Office Horizon scandal relates to the unsafe prosecution of hundreds of sub-post office operators, starting in 1999, when Labour was in office, and going on until 2015, at which point the Conservatives had been in power for five years. Yet it seems to be the Liberal Democrats who are in most peril over the scandal at the moment. The Lib Dems were in coalition with the Tories between 2010 and 2015 and, as doubts about the Post Office prosecutions grew, the two postal affairs ministers were first Ed Davey (2010 to 2012) and then Jo Swinson (2012 to 2015), both serving in the business department led by Vince Cable. Davey is now Lib Dem leader, and Swinson and Cable were his two most recent predecessors. \nYesterday the Sunday Times used its splash to focus in particular on the role of Davey. In their story Caroline Wheeler and Harry Yorke said:\n\nThe Sunday Times can also disclose that Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, was warned 12 years ago that legal action against the Post Office over the accounting scandal could leave the taxpayer exposed to “astronomical” costs.\nAlan Bates, the former sub-postmaster who has led the long-running campaign for justice, warned of the huge potential “financial liability” in a 2011 letter to Davey, then minister for postal affairs.\nThe correspondence is one of at least five letters Bates sent him between 2010 and 2012, when he was the responsible minister, as the sub-postmasters repeatedly urged the coalition government to intervene and help them secure justice.\n\n\n\nThe Sunday Times: Post Office fury intensifies #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/mjhQ7RXfgn— George Mann (@sgfmann) January 6, 2024\n\n\nBim Afolami, a Treasury minister, told LBC this morning that Davey needed to do more to explain how he responded to the concerns raised with him at the time. Asked if he thought Davey should consider his position over this, he replied:\n\nTo be honest, I’m not one who goes around saying that (someone) needs to resign, but I do think he needs to do is he needs to be honest with people and explain why as a minister, he didn’t ask the right questions.\nIn my job, you get a huge amount of information, there are a lot of people in the civil service who are working very hard on your behalf, but what you have to do is you have to ask the key questions and interrogate what you’re told.\nAnd I think that Sir Ed needs to explain what he was told [and] why he allowed certain things to develop in the way that they did.\n\nDavey has said he was '“deeply misled” by Post Office bosses about what was happening.\n\n Related: Ed Davey accuses Post Office bosses of misleading him over Horizon IT scandal \n\n\nUpdated at 10.34am GMT\n\n\n 10.00am GMT \nPost Office scandal: more than 1m sign petition to strip ex-boss of CBE\n\nA petition calling for the former Post Office chief executive, Paula Vennells, to lose her CBE over the Horizon scandal has attracted more than 1 million signatures, Kevin Rawlinson reports.\n\n Related: Post Office scandal: more than 1m sign petition to strip ex-boss of CBE \n\n\n\n\n 9.57am GMT \n\nOn Saturday the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg revealed that internal No 10 documents from 2022 showed that, when Boris Johnson’s government was considering the Rwanda deportation scheme, Rishi Sunak as chancellor had significant doubts about the plan. When Kuenssberg interviewed him on her Sunday show yesterday, he claimed that he had always been in favour of the plan in principle but was just subjecting it to proper value-for-money scrutiny.\nBut in the Sun today Harry Cole says that, when he was running for Tory leader against Liz Truss in the summer of 2022, Sunak considered dropping the plan altogether. Cole reports:\n\nRishi Sunak considered axing the Rwanda scheme in July 2022.\nHe “weighed up” ditching the £290m deportation plan during the Tory leadership election amid fears it would not work …\nOne campaign insider said: “He was told very clearly it would go down badly with the MPs who loved it and he changed his mind.”\n\nThe Sun story, and the fact that No 10 papers about the Rwanda scheme from 2022 ended up with the BBC, imply that people who worked with Sunak in government during that period, are actively briefing against him. There may also be an attempt to pressurise Sunak into toughen up the Rwanda bill, which is due to be debated by MPs later this month. Many Tory MPs think as drafted it does not do enough to close off legal challenges to deportation flights.\n\nUpdated at 10.04am GMT\n\n\n 9.43am GMT \nFormer Cop26 president Alok Sharma says he won't back oil and gas bill, saying it implies 'UK rowing back from climate action'\n\nAlok Sharma, the former Cop26 president and former Conservative cabinet minister, will not be voting for the Rishi Sunak’s oil and gas bill tonight, criticising it as a sign the government was “not serious” about meeting its international climate commitments. As Helena Horton reports, Sharma told the Today programme this morning:\n\nWhat this bill does do is reinforce that unfortunate perception about the UK rowing back from climate action.\nWe saw this last autumn with the chopping and changing of some policies and actually not being serious about our international commitments. Just a few weeks ago at Cop28 the UK government signed up to transition away from fossil fuels. This bill is actually about doubling down on new oil and gas licences. It is actually the opposite of what we agreed to do internationally, so I won’t be supporting it …\nThe government has said this bill is about protecting energy security. But the reality is, the oil and gas extracted from the north sea is owned by private companies – the government doesn’t get to control who they sell to. And the price of oil and gas is set internationally so it won’t actually lower domestic energy bills either.\n\nHere is Helena’s full story.\n\n Related: Alok Sharma: I won’t back UK government’s oil and gas bill \n\n\n\n\n 9.28am GMT \n'Stick with the plan delivering long-term change', Rishi Sunak to say to voters\n\nGood morning. There are three types of campaign you can run during an election: ‘it’s time for a change’ (normally an opposition message, but a governing party can also campaign like this, as Boris Johnson did in 2019); ‘give us time to finish the job’ (the standard incumbent’s message); or (the last resort option) ‘you might not like us, but at least we’re not as bad as the other lot’.\nOther things being equal, the change message is normally the most powerful one, and for a few weeks last autumn Rishi Sunak tried hard to make the case that he was the candidate best equipped to offer change. Leading a party in office for more than 13 years, it was a hard sell and eventually Sunak accepted that as an argument it was implausible. Today, after some low-key meetings last week, he is doing his first major campaign event of the year, a PM Connect Q&A with voters in the north-west of England. And, according to a quote released overnight, he will formally adopt message 2 as the Conservative party’s election theme. He will say:\n\nThe choice is whether we stick with the plan that is starting to deliver the long-term change our country needs, or go back to square one with the Labour party.\n\nThe problem for Sunak is that it is increasingly questionable whether this argument is credible either. “Stick with the plan that is starting to deliver,” he will say, but as Kiran Stacey reports, some of his MPs believe that the only honest campaign message is ‘we may be rubbish, but at least we’re not Labour’. As Kiran says, the Conservative MP Danny Kruger told Conservative party members at a private event last autumn:\n\nThe narrative that the public has now firmly adopted – that over 13 years things have got worse – is one we just have to acknowledge and admit.\nSome things have been done right and well. The free school movement that Michael Gove oversaw, and universal credit – and Brexit, even though it was in the teeth of the Tory party hierarchy itself, and mismanaged – nevertheless Brexit will be the great standing achievement of our time in office.\nThese things are significant, but, overall I’m afraid, if we leave office next year, we would have left the country sadder, less united and less conservative than when we found it.\n\nKruger also said that the Conservatives were at risk of “obliteration” if they did not become more responsive to the needs of the electorate.\n\n Related: Conservatives face ‘obliteration’ as UK in worse state than 2010, Tory MP says \n\nKruger is not just any random backbencher. He is co-chair of the New Conservatives, a new group of rightwing Tory MPs that is about to go to battle with the government in the next few weeks over amendments to the Rwanda bill.\nWith luck, Sunak will be asked about these comments at the Q&A – although that is not guaranteed, because most of the questions will come from members of the public, not journalists.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10am: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, gives a speech on Scottish independence.\n11am: Rishi Sunak holds a PM Connect Q&A event in the north-west of England.\nMorning: Keir Starmer is visiting the victims of flooding in the east Midlands.\nNoon: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\nAfter 3.30pm: There is likely to be a ministerial statement on flooding. Another minister may make a statement, or respond to an urgent question, on the Post Office Horizon scandal. At some point today Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, and Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for the Post Office, are meeting to discuss how convictions might be cleared swiftly.\nLate afternoon: MPs debate the second reading of the offshore petroleum licensing bill.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "A Belfast court has thrown out a libel case brought by a leading member of Sinn Féin who was accused of shooting a prison guard, dealing a fresh blow to the party’s multiple lawsuits against the media. Master Evan Bell of the high court on Monday struck out the action by Gerry Kelly, who took a case against the journalist and commentator Malachi O’Doherty, calling it “scandalous, frivolous and vexatious”. In a 55-page ruling the judge said the attempt to personally sue O’Doherty was “completely untenable” and an effort to abuse the law to intimidate and silence a critic. “It would be utterly unjust if the court were to allow the proceedings to continue.” The ruling followed two other recent failed attempts by Sinn Féin members to sue a politician in Northern Ireland and a newspaper in Ireland. Press freedom groups have accused the party of using strategic lawsuits against public participation (Slapps), a form of legal harassment intended to muzzle critics. Sinn Féin has denied the accusation. Kelly, 70, is a Stormont assembly member who was convicted of planting IRA car bombs in London in 1973. In 1983 he was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison, during which a guard, John Adams, was shot in the head. Adams, who survived, identified Kelly as the gunman. Kelly has never admitted it and was found not guilty in a 1987 trial. He has written books about the breakout that cloak the gunman’s identity. In two radio interviews in 2019, O’Doherty, an author and Belfast Telegraph commentator, said Kelly was the gunman. Kelly issued a writ for defamation a year later. The judge said a right-thinking person would take the view that a man who bombed central London had “lost his moral compass” and placed little value on human life. In relation to the 1987 acquittal, he said criminal proceedings had a higher standard of proof than civil proceedings.  “What Mr Kelly has written in his books, in my view, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to rebut the argument that he was not a joint tort-feasor in respect of the battery.” Bell said politicians had a right to their good name but in the interest of political speech and democracy should show restraint in suing journalists, and that Kelly’s case amounted to a Slapp. “I therefore award Dr O’Doherty both the costs of this application and the costs of the action on an indemnity basis.”   Related: Sinn Féin’s rising tally of lawsuits fuels fears it is trying to stifle scrutiny   The Irish government and press freedom groups have repeatedly accused Sinn Féin of trying to stifle legitimate scrutiny, a claim it rejects. Its members are believed to have at least eight active cases against media outlets, with additional cases against political opponents. Michelle O’Neill, the party’s deputy leader, won a libel action against a Democratic Unionist party councillor, John Carson, who posted that she would be “put back in her kennel”, but received no payout because the Belfast court said the remark, though offensive and misogynistic, had had no adverse impact on her reputation. In December a Dublin high court dismissed a defamation action against the Sunday Life, the sister paper of the Belfast Telegraph. The action was taken by a constituency organiser, Liam Lappin, who said he had been defamed in its description of a photograph of him and 13 others at a Sinn Féin Christmas party."

        "content": "Surely it can’t go on like this for the rest of the year. If it does, then we will all be driven mad by the end of it. Assuming we’re not already. Rishi Sunak has started 2024 as he means to go on. In full election mode. The prime minister is seemingly no longer interested in governing the country – it’s scarcely registered with him that half the country is flooded. Then again, if your primary mode of transport is a helicopter, I guess you don’t really notice. All that matters is scoring cheap points as he scrabbles around to think of reasons people might vote for him. On Monday, the first day parliament was back after the Christmas recess, Sunak was in Accrington to deliver yet another of his PM Disconnects to a carefully curated audience of about 100 people who had been rounded up by Conservative head office. Even so, many of those in the hall soon began to wonder if they had been dragged out under false pretences. Long before the 40-minute session had ended, people were staring at their phones, willing for any old email to distract them. Even spam would do. The applause was half-hearted at best, save from the chosen ones. The anointed apparatchiks. If this was a home crowd, it’s going to be a long year for the prime minister. Rish! strode to the centre of the audience, gave an awkward hug to the local MP Sara Britcliffe and tried to engage the little people. To bestow upon them his blessings. No matter how hard he tries, he just doesn’t have the common touch. Incapable of not instinctively talking down to everyone. Condescension is his modus operandi. It’s the default setting for anyone who has come to believe in their own infallibility. “I’m going to be straight with you,” Sunak said, exuding all the high-energy futility of a jacketless Ricky Gervais in The Office. A sure sign that he was about to start lying. As if on cue, he didn’t disappoint. He knew he had said that he was the change candidate and he wasn’t going to apologise for that. Because he was about to change into the continuity candidate. The guy you could trust to really screw things up. Why get in an amateur wrecking ball when you could have a professional? It turned out that Rish! thought Rish! was a really amazing guy. A magician who made things happen. Who could create something out of nothing. Remember those five pledges – sorry, five thingummies – that he had made a year ago? Well, he had done some in-depth analysis on the back of an envelope and had concluded he had delivered on all five. Debt. The economists might say it’s not going down, but Rish! had just paid off his Christmas credit card debt so it must be. Growth. We weren’t actually in recession, so if you just recalibrated the axes of the graph then we were living in boom times. Small boats. When you thought about it, stopping about half was the same as stopping all of them. Hospital waiting lists. Definitely falling if you turned the piece of paper the other way up. Inflation. It had been nothing to do with him when it had gone up and everything to do with him when it had fallen. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! “You can’t trust Keir Starmer,” Rish! squeaked. “He’ll take us back to square one.” Let’s think this through. On the bright side – in Sunak’s wildest dreams – we were at square two. But really things feel a lot worse than they were. Not surprising, because they are. Every family is a lot worse off than they were in 2019. And in 2010 for that matter. It’s been 14 years of steady decline, punctuated by the amorality of Boris Johnson and the disastrous fantasies of Liz Truss. So the most likely scenario is that we are at square minus four. Which means that someone who will return us to square one – a World that Time Forgot Before the Tories Got Their Hands On It – sounds like a decent bet. After all, what is the downside? There’s almost nothing left to completely fuck up. And that little guy in the white shirt promising to continue the Conservatives’ reign of terror is to be avoided at all costs. Something tells me this latest reset will go in to the same bin as all the others. Come in No 10, your time is up. But Sunak was adamant that he was the man. He wasn’t afraid to take the difficult decisions, he insisted. That was why he had cancelled the northern leg of HS2. But not to worry. There would still be fast trains travelling to Manchester. They just wouldn’t be going any faster than the present ones. And would be subject to the same delays. You have to hand it to Rish!. He thinks of everything. It does seem, though, that he is afraid of taking the difficult questions. Because after a few doozies from loyalists in the audience, Sunak only took three from largely non-hostile media outlets. And even those were far too barbed for him. What did he say to reports that during his failed leadership campaign he had wanted to trash the Rwanda scheme? “I never said I was going to scrap it.” he blustered. Deliberately missing the point. No one had ever accused him of that. Then he went lamely for the Labour leader again. “He’s got no plans.” Try listening, Rish!. He’s got plenty. Some of us have heard them more times than we care to remember. It’s just they are different to yours. They might even work. But for Sunak, anyone who disagrees with him has committed a cardinal sin. They must be nullified. Finally we got to Post Office Horizon. The one thing that is now on every politician’s mind since last week’s ITV drama. Though it was of little interest to many before that. I’ve sat through several urgent questions and statements on the scandal over the past 10 years and there’s never been more than 50 MPs in the chamber for any of them. So 600 MPs hadn’t given a toss. Including Sunak. I don’t recall him ever showing his face for one. But now Rish! has been watching the telly – or more likely, the public mood – and concluded something needs to be done. Though he doesn’t seem sure what. Someone should remind him that he’s the prime minister and the buck stops with him. There again, why bother? It’s not for much longer.

        "content": "The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has urged independence supporters to defect from the Scottish National party to “boot the Tories out” of Downing Street, as the first minister, Humza Yousaf, told wavering voters that the cost of living crisis made independence more urgent than ever. As the two leaders made their first major speeches on Monday, in what is expected to be a general election year, both made particular reference to pro-independence voters. The cohort will be essential in the coming campaign as voters previously loyal to the SNP are becoming convinced that Labour can offer more immediate solutions to soaring household bills and crumbling public services. With most recent polling suggesting Sarwar’s revitalised Scottish Labour is close to matching the SNP in Westminster voting intention, he told activists 2024 would be a “momentous” year in which Scotland could “lead the way in booting out these Tories, and electing a UK Labour government”. He added that after “16 years of decline and incompetence” this was “a chance to turn the page on the SNP too”. Speaking at Rutherglen town hall, where Scottish Labour won a “seismic” victory against the SNP in last autumn’s byelection, Sarwar appealed directly to independence supporters – which polling indicates to be about half of voters – telling them: “I don’t care how you voted in the past.” He said: “We may ultimately disagree on the final destination for Scotland, but on this part of the journey, let’s unite to change our country.” But while Sarwar insisted that electing more Scottish Labour MPs would give Scotland “a voice at the heart of the Labour government”, Yousaf said that “what is best for Scotland is likely to be a distant afterthought in the general election contest”. Introducing a series of Scottish government talks at Glasgow University on the economic potential of independence, Yousaf said that for those “who are sympathetic to independence but who are not yet persuaded or who don’t think this is the right time”, his argument was that “independence is urgent”. He added: “It is urgent precisely because the cost of living is top of people’s concerns.” As he highlighted the UK’s productivity gap compared with European neighbours as well as inequalities between London and the rest of the UK, Yousaf said: “It’s impossible to see how any Westminster government, particularly with both main parties committed to Brexit, and with no real economic alternative being presented from Keir Starmer, can change this trend.” In a direct riposte to Sarwar’s appeal to former Yes voters, Yousaf said in a Q&A after the speech that Scotland had a choice whether to elect SNP MPs who had proved they would always stand up for Scotland’s interests or Labour members who were “there to make up their numbers”. Yousaf’s remarks come a day after one of his most senior MPs, Tommy Sheppard, told voters not to abandon the Scottish Nationalists in favour of Labour, arguing that progress towards would be blocked if the SNP lost its Westminster majority in Scotland. Writing for Guardian Opinion on Monday, Liz Lloyd, former chief of staff to previous first minister Nicola Sturgeon, argued that the more Labour is “reliant on latent pro-independence supporters for success”, the harder it becomes for the party to ignore increasing support for separation in the longer term."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has refused to endorse the partner of the disgraced former Conservative MP Peter Bone to replace him as the party’s candidate in the Wellingborough byelection. Helen Harrison’s selection on Sunday has drawn controversy given the byelection was triggered after more than 10% of local voters signed a petition to recall Bone after revelations about his behaviour. Bone, who had held the seat with a majority since 2005, was recalled after the parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. At his first PM Connect event of the year, the prime minister was asked if he was “proud” Harrison was selected given her connection to Bone. Sunak dodged the opportunity to give his support to the Tory candidate, instead telling an audience at Accrington Stanley Football Club on Monday: “Candidate selection is done locally, so local members in their area can choose a given candidate, that’s how it works in our party. “We believe in empowering people locally, that’s how we do it and that’s the same with all byelections.” Responding to a question on whether he would be ready to campaign in the constituency with Harrison, he said: “Of course I want to win all byelections.” His remarks came after Bone was forced to deny reports that he had threatened to stand as an independent if the Conservatives did not include his girlfriend on their shortlist of candidates. Bone denied the report in the Sunday Times, noting it would have been “entirely unsurprising” if Harrison, who serves as a councillor on North Northamptonshire council, was selected. The prime minister used the event held on the first day of the parliamentary term to warn voters they can either vote for him and stick with the Conservatives “long-term plan”, or vote for Labour and go “back to square one”. Sunak launched a number of fierce attacks on the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who he claimed did not have a plan to stop the boats, but “just snipes from the sidelines instead”. But when asked if he had ever discussed scrapping the Rwanda scheme during the 2022 Tory leadership campaign, Sunak told the audience: “I didn’t say I was going to scrap it. I mean that’s completely false. Of course I didn’t.” He did say it was his job as then chancellor “to ask some probing questions” and scrutinise money spent on taxpayers’ behalf. It follows reports in the Sun that suggested he considered campaigning on a promise to ditch the scheme during his unsuccessful bid for the leadership against Liz Truss, but was warned off the idea on the grounds it would upset Conservative MPs. Stressing his determination to get the scheme running, he said the “long-term solution to this problem is to have a deterrent”, adding that the government was already making progress on “stopping the boats” but needed the added deterrence of the Rwanda plan. In an effort to come across to voters as plain-talking, the prime minister called for the need to be “frank” as he admitted not enough progress had been made in reducing NHS waiting lists. “Although we’ve virtually eliminated the people waiting the longest, we haven’t yet made a significant enough dent in the waiting lists,” he said, partly blaming strikes."

        "content": "Centrist Conservative MPs have hit back after one of their rightwing colleagues claimed the party “faces obliteration” at the next election unless it shifts to the right. Members of the One Nation group of Tories have rejected the claims made by Danny Kruger that the party has made Britain worse during its 13 years in power and could be on course for a heavy defeat at this year’s election. The internal row is another sign of the difficulties facing the prime minister as he tries to unite his party before the election and eliminate its 18-point deficit in the opinion polls. Rishi Sunak travelled to Accrington on Monday morning to answer questions from voters, where he insisted his party was making things better for British people. Stephen Hammond, a leading member of the One Nation group, said Kruger was wrong to say the country had deteriorated under the Tories, and urged the prime minister not to shift to the right in search of votes. “The Conservative party needs to accept mistakes have been made – most significantly the hyperbole about the benefits of Brexit – and regain its traditional strengths and principles,” he said. “Government means facing and dealing with the issues and problems in a pragmatic not dogmatic manner. “The party is at its best when we are socially accepting and embrace aspiration. We shouldn’t be hectoring people about the way they live their lives; we should be creating the economy and the country that allows them to fulfil their ambitions for themselves.” He added: “We win elections by offering hope – a vision of a prosperous Britain in the 2020s/30s, not the Reform vision of the 1950s. Dogmatism turns the voters away. Lurching to the extremes of either left or right of the political spectrum turns voters off.” Another former minister and member of the One Nation group added: “Since 2010 the government has dealt with the aftermath of the financial crash, Covid, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and much more … Every Conservative should be turning their wrath on the policy vacuum that is the Labour party and remember that elections are won from the centre ground.” Kruger had said the rise in far-right parties in Europe should provide a warning for his own, urging ministers to stop pursuing “models of mass migration, political correctness, and economic short-termism”. He added: “Either we remember the people we work for, or we face obliteration.” It came after the Guardian approached him about comments he made at a private event last year, when he told Tory members the party risked being ejected from power having made the country “sadder, less united and less conservative”. As a founding member of the New Conservatives, Kruger is one of a number of increasingly influential backbenchers hoping to push the party further to the right, especially on issues such as immigration and personal identity. But in recent months, moderates have begun to push back. Damian Green, the chair of the group, said at the weekend: “The old saying that it’s the economy, stupid, still applies for general elections.” The One Nation group will hold a reception in Westminster this week as it hopes to flex its muscle within the Tory party. A test of its strength will come within weeks, when MPs vote on the bill to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. The New Conservatives and other rightwing groups have been pushing Sunak to toughen the bill, while moderates are concerned that doing so could violate international law. With MPs due to return to the Commons later on Monday, Sunak attempted to present an upbeat note during a question-and-answer session in Accrington. “We are building a brighter future for your children and grandchildren, and I want to deliver a renewed sense of pride in our country,” he said."

        "content": "Alok Sharma, the UK’s former business and energy secretary, will not be voting for Rishi Sunak’s oil and gas bill, criticising it as a sign the government was “not serious” about meeting its international climate commitments. The bill, due to be debated in parliament on Monday, would allow for an annual licensing regime for oil and gas exploration contracts. It has been hugely controversial among the green wing of the Conservative party – the former minister Chris Skidmore announced on Friday he would be stepping down as an MP as a result of the proposed legislation. Sharma, the Conservative MP for Reading West who was president of the Cop26 Glasgow climate summit in 2021, rarely rebels against the government, but was heavily critical of the bill. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I will not be voting for this bill.” He added: “What this bill does do is reinforce that unfortunate perception about the UK rowing back from climate action.” He said: “We saw this last autumn with the chopping and changing of some policies and actually not being serious about our international commitments. Just a few weeks ago at Cop28 the UK government signed up to transition away from fossil fuels. This bill is actually about doubling down on new oil and gas licences. It is actually the opposite of what we agreed to do internationally, so I won’t be supporting it.” Downing Street on Monday rejected Sharma’s criticisms. A spokesperson said: “The government believes that it’s common sense to make the most of what we can produce here rather than shipping in from foreign regimes with higher emissions.” Ministers are not expecting a major rebellion on Monday night, although Zac Goldsmith, the Tory peer and former environment minister, urged Conservative MPs to follow Sharma’s example and vote against the bill. He told the Guardian: “Conservatives are facing almost certain defeat at the election and so now is not the time for colleagues to be slavishly obedient to a leadership that simply will not be there in a matter of months. “This vote is about something so much more important than the average vote, and members will not be able to sanitise their records in the years to come. Some will be ex-MPs, others will cling on, but all of them will want to be able to tell their children and grandchildren that they were on the right side of history. It really is as simple as that.” The government has claimed that the bill will help energy security and contribute to bringing down energy bills, but Sharma said this was not the case. He said: “The government has said this bill is about protecting energy security. But the reality is, the oil and gas extracted from the North Sea is owned by private companies – the government doesn’t get to control who they sell to. And the price of oil and gas is set internationally so it won’t actually lower domestic energy bills either.” Government claims over the bill have been criticised by scientists and the independent Climate Change Committee. This weekend, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was criticised by the head of the CCC over his assurances that the government could still meet its climate targets while allowing companies to extract more oil and gas from the North Sea. Last week, it was revealed that, contrary to claims that the oil would be used in the UK, the government appears to accept that the private companies extracting the oil would sell the vast majority internationally, saying: “It is not desirable to force private companies to ‘allocate’ oil and gas produced in the North Sea for domestic use.” The statement was in response to a parliamentary question by the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle."

        "content": "The Conservatives face “obliteration” at the next election after leaving the country in a worse state than they inherited it in 2010, a senior Tory MP has said, in a stark assessment of the party’s 13 years in government. Danny Kruger, a leading backbencher and founder of the increasingly influential New Conservatives group, said the Conservatives risked being ejected from power this year having left the country “sadder, less united and less conservative” than they found it. The comments, which were made both at an event last year and in response to a Guardian inquiry, come just as the prime minister seeks to rally his troops with a hint of tax cuts to come in the budget ahead of an election later this year. Sunak will host an event in the north-west of England on Monday, where he will urge voters to stick with the Conservatives, saying: “The choice is whether we stick with the plan that is starting to deliver the long-term change our country needs, or go back to square one with the Labour party.” But the prime minister faces a difficult start to election year, with the possibility of a significant rebellion on Monday over his plan to extract more oil and gas from the North Sea, and another within weeks over the Rwanda bill. Sunak is also likely to have to fight three difficult byelections in Kingswood, Blackpool South and Wellingborough – all of which Labour hope to win. Speaking to a private event of Tory members organised by the thinktank ResPublica last October, Kruger said: “The narrative that the public has now firmly adopted – that over 13 years things have got worse – is one we just have to acknowledge and admit.” He added: “Some things have been done right and well. The free school movement that Michael Gove oversaw, and universal credit – and Brexit, even though it was in the teeth of the Tory party hierarchy itself, and mismanaged – nevertheless Brexit will be the great standing achievement of our time in office. “These things are significant, but, overall I’m afraid, if we leave office next year, we would have left the country sadder, less united and less conservative than when we found it.” A source at the event passed the comments to the Guardian. When a reporter approached Kruger to ask about them, he said: “This was a conversation among party members in which I made the case for realism and for honesty with the public.” He added that the rise of the far right in Europe should provide a warning for the Tory party. “For decades, across the western world, centre-right parties have controlled the institutes of the state – yet nevertheless have presided over a drift away from their stated values and the interests of their voters,” he said. “Conservatives worldwide have presided over models of mass migration, political correctness and economic short-termism. The British government is making some of the right moves to correct this. But the reaction under way in Europe at the moment is a warning to my party – either we remember the people we work for, or we face obliteration.” Kruger’s comments reflect widespread pessimism on the Tory benches about the direction of the party and its chances of winning the next election. As a founder of the New Conservatives, Kruger is a leading light of the socially conservative movement which is urging Sunak to shift further to the right on issues such as immigration. He is one of dozens of Tory MPs who rebelled last year on the Rwanda bill, arguing that it did not do enough to stop legal appeals against deporting asylum seekers to the African country. His comments about the rise of the far right in Europe are an indication of growing concern on the Tory benches about the rise of Reform UK, the populist party originally established by Nigel Farage as a successor to Ukip. Polls show Reform has risen from about 5% a year ago to about 9% today, mainly by attracting the kinds of Brexit-supporting former Labour voters whom Boris Johnson managed to win over in 2019. Kruger’s comments also undermine the prime minister’s attempts to strike a more optimistic tone at the start of the election year. Sunak will say at the PM Connect event on Monday: “But this government has made progress. At the start of this year, we are pointing in the right direction.” The prime minister is also under pressure from another group of more centrist backbenchers, many of whom share Kruger’s bleak assessment of the party’s electoral outlook but have a very different set of remedies. The moderate One Nation group has become more vocal in recent months, warning in November that turning to the right risked “falling into an unrecoverable position with most of the voters”. Many of their members are urging the prime minister to keep his focus on the economy and aspiration, rather than moving to the right on issues such as immigration and identity politics. Damian Green, the chair of the One Nation group, said that Kruger’s diagnosis of the problems facing the party was flawed. “The old saying that it’s the economy, stupid, still applies for general elections,” he said. “That’s where the Conservatives should fight. We need to convince would-be Conservative voters of all kinds if we want to win.” Downing Street did not respond to a request to comment."

Helen Harrison will be the Tory candidate for the Northamptonshire seat, the party chair announced on Sunday, after a meeting of local Conservative members. A date has not been set yet for the byelection, which was triggered after more than 10% of local voters signed a petition to recall him in the aftermath of the revelations about his behaviour. It is one of at least two difficult forthcoming byelections for the Tories after the announcement by Chris Skidmore on Friday that he intends to stand down as an MP for Kingswood near Bristol in protest over the government’s energy policy. Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, tweeted on Sunday: “Congratulations to Cllr @helenharrisonuk on being selected for #Wellingborough at a packed meeting of @Conservatives members this afternoon.” The Sunday Times reported that Bone had threatened to stand as an independent if the Tories did not include Harrison on their shortlist of candidates. Bone denied that report, but said it would be “entirely unsurprising” if Harrison, who serves as a councillor on North Northamptonshire council, were selected. Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “Rishi Sunak caving to Peter Bone’s demand to select his partner so he doesn’t run as an independent shows just how weak the prime minister is. Rishi Sunak is too weak to lead his own party, let alone the country. “The people of Wellingborough deserve the best possible candidate to represent them, not the product of a quick political fix. Only Labour can deliver the change the voters want to see and give Britain its future back.” Bone had a majority of nearly 20,000, but Labour held the seat from 1997 to 2005. Bone was recalled after the parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. The panel upheld an earlier report that found he had repeatedly hit and verbally abused a member of his staff, asked him for massages and on one occasion put his bare genitals in the other man’s face."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has said he wants to cut taxes for working people further this year, possibly cutting welfare payments to fund it. The prime minister said on Sunday his priority before the budget in March would be further tax cuts, which he said would entail stricter controls on public spending and benefits. His comments set up the possibility of an income tax cut in March, what is likely to be the last major tax decision by the chancellor before the general election. Sunak told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “My priority going forward – which the chancellor also reiterated at the weekend – our joint priority for the country is to make sure that we control spending, control welfare so that we can cut people’s taxes.” He said he wanted to oversee “discipline” in both public sector pay and benefits payments, singling out long-term disability payments as one area for savings. “It’s about making sure that everybody who can work does work,” he said. “And for everyone who was working hard, we reward that hard work with tax cuts. That is a Conservative approach, is one that I think is right for our country.” Separately, he told the Sunday Telegraph: “When I say that I want to keep cutting taxes, that’s what we’re going to deliver. We’re going to do that responsibly. That requires difficult decisions on public spending. It requires difficult decisions to control welfare.” His comments will delight some Conservative backbenchers who have been clamouring for pre-election tax cuts as a way to close the significant poll gap with Labour. However, the prime minister’s focus on pay for working people may disappoint those who have been calling for him to use any spare money to cut inheritance tax instead. They also contrast with the message given on Saturday by his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, that he “did not know” whether he would be able to afford further tax cuts this year. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, also said he would want to reduce taxes on working people as soon as possible, but accused the prime minister of prioritising immediate cuts over economic growth. “It’s not part of a strategy for growing the economy,” he told Sky News. “It’s simply picking tax cuts that the prime minister thinks might create a dividing line going into the election.” Sunak talked in particular of his desire to have fewer people claiming benefits for being unable to work because of long-term sickness or disability. Hunt announced at his autumn statement in November that hundreds of thousands of people would have to look for work they could do from home or face having their benefits cut by nearly £5,000 a year. That prompted accusations from disability charities that the government was punishing disabled people and adding anxiety to households that were already struggling. But on Sunday the prime minister defended the cuts, saying they were part of a wider plan to significantly reduce the number of people claiming those benefits. “You’ve seen the number of people who are signed off has tripled,” he said. “So do I think our country is three times sicker than it was a decade ago? The answer is no. That the system is not working as it was designed to work.” MPs return to Westminster on Monday with the prime minister facing criticism on several fronts and a series of potentially damaging byelections within weeks. On Friday the former Tory minister Chris Skidmore said he would quit as an MP in protest at the government’s plans to issue more oil and gas licences in the North Sea, triggering a byelection in his Kingswood seat. There will be another in Wellingborough after voters recalled the sitting Tory MP, who was found to have bullied and harassed a member of staff.   Related: Rishi Sunak’s woes mount with oil bill rebellion, byelections and asylum row   A third could take place in Blackpool South, where the Conservative MP Scott Benton is fighting a lengthy suspension from parliament after being found to have breached lobbying rules. Some Tory MPs want the prime minister to take a more aggressive stance on a range of issues before what he said last week would be an election in the second half of the year. As well as significant tax cuts, many in his party want to toughen up his bill to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda before it comes back to the Commons for another vote. Sunak urged his colleagues and voters on Sunday to stay the course, however. “The choice now is to stick to the plan, and that’s what I’m going to do because the plan will deliver the long-term change that our country needs,” he said. He added: “I feel upbeat because of the progress we’ve made. And the fact that I know we’re now pointing in the right direction.”"

        "content": "A 34-year-old Spanish woman was forcibly removed from the UK after returning from a Christmas holiday near Málaga despite presenting Brexit paperwork to border officials showing she has a right to live and work in the country. She was flown back to Spain after being detained overnight in Luton airport on 26 December and told she was “wasting her time” if she thought the Home Office documentation she had showing her right to live in the UK was valid. Alistair Strathern, the Labour MP for Mid Bedfordshire, said he was looking for answers from the Home Office about the case. “I went home because my sister had a little baby girl, and literally four days later in Luton airport they took me to the detention room, took my stuff and my phone and told me to wait there. I was left there all night and then put on a plane,” said Maria, whose name has been changed. The removal has left her in shock but also illustrates the jeopardy facing EU citizens whose applications to remain in the UK under the Brexit withdrawal agreement are yet to be concluded. Maria’s husband flew out to Spain to help after British border officials warned her not to try to re-enter the country for a month. She said: “I was supposed to be back at work but now my life has gone. All my stuff is in the UK: my dog, my car. I was doing this veterinary nursing apprenticeship, which was my dream. “If I try and go back it will be even worse.” Maria, a Spanish designer who is in the middle of a career change to a job working with animals, had made a late application for the EU settlement scheme in 2023 and was living with her husband and parents-in-law in Bedfordshire. Her application was refused in June on the grounds she did not provide sufficient evidence, but she had asked for an administrative review of the decision and had a certificate of application (CoA) from the Home Office. It states “you can work in the UK until you receive a decision on your application to the EU settlement scheme”.   Related: Italian woman facing removal from UK despite ‘permanent residency’ card   “I could have told them I was a tourist but I’m not and I have nothing to hide and told them that. I am waiting for appeal decision and hence I continue working,” she said. She said the border official, who coincidentally had also stopped her in August but let her through the controls after consulting her colleague, told her the paperwork was not valid. “She told me I was ‘wasting my time’ and it ‘was not true’ that I could work and I said, ‘Well there must be a hole in the system because my papers say I can do that and now you are telling me what the Home Office says is not true.’” Maria lived in the UK from 2014 to 2018 and had more recently returned after a period in South Africa where her husband was completing his PhD. Covid lockdowns meant they were unable to return during the pandemic. Under the rules she is permitted to make a late application but must demonstrate her break from the UK was not so long as to invalidate her rights under the withdrawal agreement. The Border Force refused entry on the grounds that her “application for EUSS [EU settlement scheme] has been refused” and “you no longer have a right of admission to the UK as saved by the Citizens’ Rights (Application Deadline and Temporary Protection) Regulations 2020”. Maria, who is now taking legal advice, rejects this version of events, arguing her certificate of application makes plain her right to work in the UK while her case is still being reviewed. Strathern said: “It is really important, if our borders are to be secure and people are to have confidence in border officials, that they are empowered to act within the law, and it seems in this case that does not appear to have happened and there is a gap and I am more than happy to escalate this with the Home Office.” The Home Office said the issue for those with certificate of applications trying to enter the country was not about their right to work but about demonstrating evidence they had the right to be in the country under the withdrawal agreement. Those refused entry at the border were “liable for detention pending their removal from the port and UK”. But it added that “this is not the same as being subject to a deportation order which, whilst valid, would prevent re-entry to the UK”. They also said a certificate of application did not give an EU citizen a right of travel in and out of the country and border officials were entitled to ask those who hold a CoA for further evidence of their residence in the UK before December 2020 at the border. “Border Force’s number one priority is to keep our borders safe and secure, and we will never compromise on this,” a Home Office spokesperson said. “Officers may stop any arriving passenger for the purposes of further examination where they are not immediately satisfied that they qualify for entry. This decision is taken based on the information that the passenger provides, not their nationality.”"

        "content": "The next general election is set to herald the most diverse parliament ever, with record numbers of ethnic minority and female MPs, according to a detailed analysis of candidate selections in winnable seats. The study, by the thinktank British Future, projects that the number of ethnic minority MPs is most likely to rise from 65 to as many as 83, with much of this rise expected whatever the actual outcome of the election. If the number of ethnic minority MPs does reach 75 or more, it will have increased fivefold in a decade and a half, having been just 15 out of 650 in the 2005 to 2010 parliament. With the main parties now having selected about 90% of their candidates for winnable target constituencies and early retirement seats, the study also forecasts that there will be more than 250 women in the Commons after the next general election for the first time ever, up from 220 in 2019. About 153 of these would be Labour and 72 Conservative. If Labour wins 326 seats, the slimmest majority possible, British Future estimates that there will be 254 women MPs (39% of the total) in the Commons. It says the proportion could easily rise above 40% with late selections or if Labour wins enough seats for a working majority. The Conservatives can argue, however, that while their numbers of female and ethnic minority MPs are lower than Labour’s, they have had three female party leaders and prime ministers – Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Liz Truss – and a string of ethnic minority politicians who have occupied top posts in recent years, including Rishi Sunak as prime minister, Sajid Javid and Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor, Priti Patel and Suella Braverman as home secretary and James Cleverley as foreign secretary. In 14 of the constituencies in which Labour MPs have decided to stand down, seven of these have selected ethnic minority candidates. Some of these are among Labour’s safest seats.  Miatta Fahnbulleh in London’s Camberwell and Peckham will be defending a majority of 33,780. Abtisam Mohammad will defend a 27,273 majority in Sheffield Central, and Jas Athwal, who was selected in Ilford South in a contest with former shadow minister Sam Tarry, will defend a 24,101 majority in the London constituency. More modest majorities will be defended by Baggy Shanker in Derby South (6,019), Satvir Kaur (6,213) in Southampton Test and Harpreet Uppal (4,937) in Huddersfield, but all are in with a good chance of winning, given that Labour is unlikely to lose in the seats it holds. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said that while the cause of diversity was advancing, a chance to make more progress at the coming election may not be fully grasped because the selection rate of women had fallen in Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat party selections in this parliament – with more than six out of 10 “class of 2024” candidates being male in all three parties. The Labour party, while having the strongest overall record on ethnic minority representation in the Commons, is selecting ethnic minority candidates this time at a much lower rate – 12% – than the 20% proportion now in the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) . Katwala said: “The next parliament will be the most diverse ever, reflecting a new norm across political parties. More ethnic minorities and more women are likely to sit in the Commons than ever before. Parliament is gradually catching up with the electorate that it represents. “But this needs to accelerate further if it is to keep pace with the growing diversity of our society and close the gender gap. Despite progress, parties could miss a 2024 opportunity to surf the wave of a ‘big change’ election and bring new gains for representation. “While the Labour party is still well ahead of its rivals on gender and minority representation, advances could stall this time round. For the first time, the cohort of incoming Labour MPs could be less diverse than the current PLP. “Parliament and political parties should collect data on ethnicity and social class, to track representation, identify gaps and ensure all groups are getting a fair chance.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak is facing a backlash in parliament this week over plans to allow more oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, as Tory troubles pile up on multiple fronts in the run-up to a general election expected this year. MPs return to Westminster on Monday after the Christmas break with all parties gearing up for what will inevitably be a bitter election battle that could end the Conservatives’ 13 and a half years in power. Sunak’s hopes of a trouble-free start to 2024 were dashed on Friday when Chris Skidmore, a former Conservative energy minister, resigned as an MP in protest at the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill, which will be debated in the Commons on Monday. The bill will establish a new system under which licences for oil and gas projects in the North Sea will be awarded annually – a plan that has enraged green MPs of all parties and caused consternation across the world. Skidmore, who said he could not vote for legislation that “clearly promotes the production of new oil and gas” and would show that the UK is “rowing ever further back from its climate commitments” is expected to make his last speech in the Commons during the debate and will refuse to vote for the bill. Other Tories, including Alok Sharma, a former cabinet minister and chair of the Cop26 international climate summit, are expected to speak against the bill as a green backlash to the government’s stance on climate policy grows. Theresa May, a former prime minister, has also previously raised objections to the licensing plan. Amid signs of increasing coordination on green policy issues among MPs of different political persuasions, Skidmore and another former Tory minister Lord Goldsmith have signed an all-party letter to Claire Coutinho, the energy secretary, calling for the bill to be dropped. The letter from the all-party parliamentary group for climate change says: “Just last month, as the UK’s second warmest year on record concluded, the UK joined other countries in signing the UAE consensus at Cop28 and thus pledged to transition way from fossil fuels. But this bill, and the government’s commitment to ‘max out’ the North Sea’s declining oil and gas reserves, is diametrically opposed to that agreement. “Instead of honouring the promises we’ve made to our allies and partners at Cop28 this bill further weakens any claim the UK makes to be a world leader in tackling climate change.” The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it clear that no new fossil fuel projects should be licensed, as doing so goes against the recommendations of the world’s leading climate scientists. Skidmore’s decision to quit parliament leaves the prime minister facing the possibility of three difficult by­elections early this year. Skidmore retained his Kingswood seat, near Bristol, at the 2019 general election with an 11,220 majority over second-placed Labour. His seat now looks a likely gain for Labour. Defeat risks arresting any political momentum that is vital for Sunak if he is to make his party competitive again before the general election, now widely expected to be held in the autumn. He also risks the loss of Blackpool South, where a byelection is likely with the sitting MP Scott Benton facing a Commons suspension for a “very serious breach” of standards rules. Labour will easily reclaim a seat that has a majority of less than 4,000 votes. A third byelection also hands Keir Starmer another chance to win a seat that would have been beyond his party’s reach until recently. Should Labour win Wellingborough, where Peter Bone had a majority of 18,540 majority at the last election, it will boost Starmer’s argument that he is now cutting deep into Tory territory. Bone was the subject of a recall petition when he was suspended from parliament after he was found to have bullied and harassed a member of staff and exposed his genitals. Yet even before those byelections are held, Sunak will be plunged back into a row over immigration. Talks between ministers and rival groups of Tory MPs over Sunak’s controversial Rwanda bill, designed to ensure he can deport asylum-seekers to the east African country, will take place this week. Votes and amendments will take place later this month. Liberal Tories within the “one nation” wing of the party are already warning that attempting to appease the right by making the bill any more severe could trigger government resignations, given the number of moderate MPs on the frontbench. “If you are worried about the state of the party, you can’t afford to lose more ministers,” said one Tory MP. “The government is packed full of sensible one nation centrists.” The legislation attempts to limit legal challenges to sending ­asylum-seekers in Britain to Rwanda. Not a single Tory MP voted against it during the first vote on the measures. However, the right are angry that it still allows individual appeals and does not explicitly override the European Convention on Human Rights. Some on the right are now pessimistic that they have enough support to defeat the government and strengthen the bill, but they are also prepared to fight back against any changes made in the Lords, where the bill is expected to be weakened. It signals weeks of battling over a topic that has already dogged Sunak’s premiership for months. While there is no prospect of the government losing Monday’s vote on oil and gas licensing, ministers believe it will run into more problems at later parliamentary stages as MPs highlight inconsistencies in the government’s approach. Ministers, who maintained that more licences would enhance the UK’s energy security, have admitted that most of the oil from the new Rosebank field in the North Sea will be sold on the international market, rather than to UK consumers. There are powerful internal opponents. May has said: “Obviously, energy security for us is important but … new oil and gas licences only provide for energy security if all that energy is sold into the UK and, actually, it will be sold on the world market, so I think there are some questions around that.” Senior Tories also expect trouble in the House of Lords. Labour has tabled an amendment saying it “is entirely incompatible with the UK’s international climate change commitments and is a totally unnecessary piece of legislation which will do nothing to serve the UK’s national interest”. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has hit back at Skidmore over his decision. While praising his work for the government as climate change adviser, Hunt said: “I do profoundly disagree with the reasons that he gave for resigning. “The independent panel for climate change [the Climate Change Committee] that we have in this country are very clear that even when we reach net zero in 2050, we will still get a significant proportion of our energy from fossil fuels … and domestic oil and gas is four times cleaner than imported oil and gas.”"

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has said he does not know if he can afford to cut taxes for British households, on the day a national insurance reduction came into force. The main rate of national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by employees is now 10%, down from 12% as announced by the chancellor in his autumn statement in November. About 27 million UK employees were expected to benefit, the government said, despite warnings that millions of people would still end up being worse off in 2024. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Hunt said it had been right to help families during the Covid pandemic and cost of living crisis, which was why, along with the US, Germany and Japan, taxes in the UK went up. He added that the country wouldn’t be able to get back to pre-pandemic levels of tax “in one fell swoop” but said the government had made a start. Hunt said: “Nearly £1,000 off the tax bill for a typical two-earner family is a significant change and will bring significant relief to many families. What I would say in an election year is there is a very big choice because Keir Starmer made it very clear this week that it is Labour’s confident ambition that they will be able to spend £28bn a year more. “You can’t continue to reduce the tax burden and get it back to those pre-pandemic levels if your priority is to spend £28bn a year.” The chancellor said that, under the Conservatives since 2010, 3 million fewer people were paying NICs and that he believed in a “lighter” taxation regime. The class 1 contributions are made on earnings received by anyone between the age of 16 and state pension age who is getting more than £242 a week from one job. Employees will now pay 10% on earnings between £242 and £967 a week. They pay 2% on all earnings above £967 a week, which equates to an income of £50,284 a year. The Treasury has said the two percentage point reduction was “the largest ever cut to national insurance”. However, the Resolution Foundation said the net effect would result in all employees earning below £26,000 a year being worse off or unaffected, while those on more than that would gain. “If you earn £50,000, you’re in the sweet spot and will benefit most,” it said. Hunt said: “Chancellors have very little control over what’s going to happen to the GDP figures in one month compared to the previous month.”    Related: Who will benefit most as UK national insurance cut takes effect?   “I think there is no doubt at all – like America, Germany, France, all the other economies – we’ve been through a very difficult patch … and we can now look forward to things getting better.” Hunt also said he “profoundly” disagreed with the former net tsar, Chris Skidmore, who announced on Friday he was quitting the Conservatives over the government’s decision to increase domestic oil and gas drilling. Hunt said: “The independent panel for climate change that we have in this country are very clear that even when we reach net zero in 2050, we will still get a significant proportion of our energy from fossil fuels. “And domestic oil and gas is four times cleaner than imported oil and gas.” Skidmore, who carried out a net zero review for the government in 2022, announced on Friday he would stand down, citing Rishi Sunak’s environmental stance as wrong and triggering another byelection. His decision comes before a vote in the Commons on Monday on the offshore petroleum licensing bill. If passed by parliament, the legislation will mandate that licences for oil and gas projects in the North Sea are awarded annually."

        "content": "It was a week in which speculation that Nigel Farage would make a long-awaited return to frontline British politics reached a new level, before Reform UK’s 2024 policy launch. In the event, dozens of journalists who trooped to a central London hotel on the off chance that the former Ukip leaderwould appear were disappointed. Farage, Reform’s honorary president and its dominant shareholder, was not among the guests alongside the party’s leader, Richard Tice, who mounted an attack on Labour and the Conservatives and dialled up his own anti-immigration rhetoric. It raised awkward questions for Tice, and led to further speculation about Farage’s reluctance to fully commit to Reform. But polling before the event nonetheless confirmed that the populist party now presents a greater threat to the Conservatives than the Brexit party and Ukip in its heyday, according to experts. “They harm the Conservatives more now than Ukip did in 2015 because the post-Brexit Tories have a lot more ‘Ukippy’ voters – who they picked up in 2017 and 2019,” said Robert Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester who is one of Britain’s foremost experts on the behaviour of British voters. Labour and the Liberal Democrats were less threatened by Reform for the same reason, he added. They have far fewer of those voters – inclined towards Brexit and often hostile to immigration – than they did in 2010-15. Reform now poses an even bigger threat in Tory seats because its predecessor, the Brexit party, did not stand candidates against sitting Conservative MPs in 2019 in return for commitments made by the then Conservative leader, Boris Johnson. “New Reform UK candidates will therefore offer an option to voters in those seats that wasn’t there in 2019,” said Ford. As a new political year dawns, Reform’s growing presence is adding to Conservative MPs’ anxiety, as their party continues to languish behind Labour, despite Rishi Sunak’s efforts on Thursday to revive Tory fortunes by emphasising his commitment to tax cuts, immigration controls and management of the economy during a visit to the bellwether seat of Mansfield.  Interactive  YouGov polling released on 1 December put Labour on 45% (+1), the Conservatives on 22% of the vote (-3) and Reform UK on 10% (+1). While few, if any, commentators expect Reform to win any seats – the party’s confirmation on Thursday that Farage would not stand in any constituency was taken as a hint that it shared this view – the party’s polling of as much as 11% in recent surveys would be enough to decimate dozens of Conservative majorities and enhance the scale of a Labour general election win. Even before that point, it may play a key role in giving Sunak yet another byelection bloody nose in the upcoming contest in Wellingborough, where splits on the right could help Labour overturn an 18,540 majority. The Northamptonshire seat – up for grabs on the back of a recall petition triggered by the suspension of Peter Bone – is one where significant levels of deprivation and past support for Brexit may prove fertile ground for Reform. The party’s Wellingborough candidate, Ben Habib, who is also the Reform deputy leader, said: “The key for us is to ensure that the Tory voters aren’t so irritated and upset with the whole electoral landscape that they stay at home, and we can encourage them to recognise that what we stand for is actually what they voted for in the 2016 referendum.” But the contest will also be a particular test for a party that has consistently underperformed in byelections, relative to its poll showing, and which is without the alternative springboard that European parliamentary elections provided for Ukip and the Brexit party. More broadly, however, those who are less convinced about Reform’s potency include Michael Crick, author of the 2022 Farage biography One Party After Another, who cites the presence of an insurgent force on the right that stretches all the way back to James Goldsmith’s Referendum party of the 1990s. Crick said: “In every general election, there’s a sort of expectation that maybe Ukip, the Brexit party or whatever it is at that time is going to cause havoc for the Tories. They do cause problems, undoubtedly in each case, but it’s never quite as bad as everybody says.” But it would cause damage in other ways, he suggested, adding: “They will win over and attract money that might have gone to the Conservatives, from really rightwing donors, and you may well also find that quite a lot of Tory activists and officials end up voting or even working for Reform.” The latter is already happening, with those on the Tory right complaining about the difficulties of stemming a steady stream of members defecting to Reform. “Conservative voters are on strike basically, and the last four byelections have seen 20,000 Conservative voters missing in each one,” said David Campbell Bannerman, a former deputy leader of Ukip who defected back to the Tories in 2011 and later launched the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO) as a rightwing group lobbying for members’ rights. That said, he also views the Reform vote as “soft”, arguing that many Conservative voters who are considering the insurgent party would return if Sunak was ousted. But another former Ukip MEP, Patrick O’Flynn, argues that there is an anti-establishment mood that Reform could tap into in a different way. Like some other veterans of the populist tide which preceded Brexit, he also views the language used by Reform – railing against the supposed “socialism” of the Conservatives and Labour – as off the mark in terms of connecting with the public mood. Another key ingredient is also missing, of course. “Richard Tice really deserves credit for resilience, leading the party through some infertile periods to a point where the Sunak tilt back towards Cameron-style liberal conservatism has opened up a big chunk of the electorate to Reform,” he said. “But on the right, I don’t think there’s a communicator as good or as seasoned as Nigel Farage.”"

        "content": "Ravinder Athwal might have the least enviable job in the Labour party right now. As the party’s director of policy, it is up to Athwal to pull together Labour’s manifesto, a job he has until 8 February to complete. The problem for Athwal and others at the top of the Labour party is that key questions about its policy platform remain unanswered, even after the Labour leader Keir Starmer gave his new year speech earlier this week. So what questions does Athwal – and, more importantly, Starmer – have to answer before the party are ready for the election campaign to come? What to do on green spending? Starmer was clearer than ever on Friday that the pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment was no longer a pledge but instead a “confident ambition”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said last year the target was subject to the party’s rule to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output at the end of a five-year period. But it remained unclear until Starmer spelled it out on Friday that this would mean spending less if the party could not borrow the full amount, rather than finding the money elsewhere. Given the current fiscal headroom is only £13bn, should the party even be talking about the possibility of spending £28bn at all, especially given it has been subject to repeated Conservative attacks? Starmer tried to move away from the spending target on Thursday, talking instead about the party’s plan to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. But some in the party want him to go further and abandon the £28bn altogether. How much to tax? Reports this week suggested Reeves might include a promise to cut either income tax or national insurance in the party’s manifesto. Starmer appeared to pour cold water on such an idea on Thursday when he said he would look to pull “the growth lever” before cutting taxes, although he did not spell out what that would mean. One thing has become clearer, however. Starmer said on Thursday that if the Tories cut inheritance tax before the election, Labour would reverse it if it “got the opportunity to do so”. If the Tories do decide to cut inheritance tax at March’s budget, it would give Starmer room to promise to cancel that and use the money for income tax cuts instead. What to do about the asylum system? For much of the past year Labour has been happy to sit back and let the Conservatives tear themselves apart over the issue of immigration and asylum. The party says it will cancel the Rwanda scheme if it gets into government, but questions remain. The party is reported to be drawing up its own scheme to process asylum claims offshore. But where could they do this? And would it only be for people who haven’t yet reached the UK but want to come here, or could they send claimants abroad once they have already arrived? Starmer has also said he wants to help solve the asylum backlogs by working more closely with France. While the French government might be willing to take more claimants back from the UK, Britain would almost certainly have to sign up to some sort of quota in return. The question then becomes how many migrants Britain is willing to take – a question the Tories intend to focus on heavily during an election campaign. One more dilemma could yet face Labour. If the government successfully send asylum seekers to Rwanda, but the courts then deem the scheme illegal, will a Labour government bring them back home again? Will Labour replace the existing childcare system? Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, made waves last year when she gave a speech promising to scrap the existing childcare funding model and replace it with something entirely new. Phillipson argues the current model means providers having to offer almost entirely free places to millions of children without being given enough money by the government to cover their costs. Many childcare providers say they will go bust under the government’s plans to expand free hours to children aged 9 months and over. Since Phillipson’s speech, however, there has been little indication of what the new system might entail, leading some to speculate that the party is quietly shelving one of its more ambitious reform plans. How will Labour fix the NHS? The NHS uses every winter crisis to call for more money, argued Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, during a recent trip to Singapore. Labour has promised to fund 2m more hospital appointments a year and to double the number of CT and MRI scanners in an effort to get waiting times down. But apart from that, Streeting’s message has been that the health service must do things differently rather than just continuing to demand more money. Labour says one of the central planks of fixing the NHS is boosting social care so that fewer people end up in hospital in the first place, but this will cost money which Labour would need to find from somewhere. Party sources told the Observer last year they were likely to leave the social care reform package out of their manifesto altogether to avoid scrutiny. Doing so, however, might leave a hole in the NHS rescue plan."

        "content": "By his own admission Derek Draper could be a “cocky know-it-all”. His self-confidence was, on occasions, his undoing. Yet even those who had some reason to be embarrassed by his behaviour recognised he had a rare ebullience. Two former prime ministers led the political tributes, with Tony Blair saying Draper was “someone you always wanted on your side”. “He was a tough, sometimes ruthless political operative … But underneath that tough exterior he was a loving, kind, generous and good natured man you wanted as a friend,” Blair said.   Related: Lobbyist turned psychotherapist Derek Draper dies aged 56   “He was an important part of the New Labour story, at the centre of things right at the beginning. But most important of all, he was a good colleague and great friend. And we will miss him deeply.” Gordon Brown said he would remember Draper “as brilliant, creative and multitalented”. Draper first came to public prominence in 1998 in the “Lobbygate scandal”.  He had been caught boasting to an undercover Observer reporter in a way that suggested his clients could pay for access to Blair and his inner circle. “There are 17 people who count in this government, and to say I am intimate with all of them is the understatement of the century,” Draper was recorded as saying. He was working at the time for the lobbying firm GPC Market Access after a stint as a researcher for Peter Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour. “It was fair enough that I got caught being a bigheaded boaster,” Draper told the Guardian later. He was suspended from the lobbying firm within a day, and sacked as a columnist for the Express and editor of the Labour magazine Progress. It marked the end of a hedonistic time that he described as “hanging around the Groucho Club and … doing drugs” or “chasing after some pretty new researcher”. Draper had a breakdown after the scandal and stepped back from public life. After a four-week stay at the Priory, he started having therapy. He then rebuilt his life as a psychotherapist after training in Berkeley, California. He married the TV presenter Kate Garraway in 2005 in a wedding that featured in the celebrity magazine OK!. The couple had two children, Darcey and Billy. He told the Guardian in 2003: “There is not a single cell in my body that wants to go back into politics.” He returned to the political fold in 2008, however, to become an unpaid adviser to the Labour party. The son of a British Leyland shop steward, he also set up the LabourList website. He planned it as a left-leaning alternative to the Conservative Home website and other rightwing blogs. At the time Michael Gove, then a shadow minister, described Draper as “irrepressible”. He said: “Derek is like a character in a novel who plays a prominent role and then disappears for a couple of chapters only to re-emerge again … You always feel there is a whiff of danger because you don’t know what he is going to do next.” Within a year Draper was forced to resign as the founding editor of LabourList when he was caught up in a No 10 smear scandal. He was sent an email from Gordon Brown’s aide Damian McBride outlining a plot to spread malicious gossip about George Osborne, David Cameron and others. “Absolutely, totally brilliant,” Draper unwisely replied. In his resignation statement he admitted it had been a “stupid, hasty reply” and that he should have immediately dismissed the plot as wrong. He withdrew from public life for a second time, vowing to concentrate on his therapy practice and limiting his political involvement to delivering leaflets for his local Labour party. Just after his resignation he published a self-help book, Life Support: A Survival Guide for the Modern Soul. It was very different from his first book, Blair’s Hundred Days, which was dismissed as hagiography. Instead of celebrating Blair, this time Draper discussed his hostility towards him.

        "content": "A former Conservative minister has announced he is resigning as an MP in protest at the party’s dash for oil and gas, setting up an awkward vote for the prime minister on the issue on Monday and an even more difficult byelection within weeks. Chris Skidmore, a leading voice within the Tory party on green issues, said on Friday he would resign from parliament as soon as it returns next week over Rishi Sunak’s bill to allow new oil and gas licences to be issued. Skidmore called the bill a “tragedy”, accusing the prime minister of being committed to a course of action that is “wrong and will cause future harm”. His resignation in Kingswood will trigger at least the eighth byelection in a year, with Labour looking to chalk up another victory in a seat with an 11,000 majority. Skidmore said in his resignation statement: “This bill would in effect allow more frequent new oil and gas licences and the increased production of new fossil fuels in the North Sea.” He added: “I can also no longer condone nor continue to support a government that is committed to a course of action that I know is wrong and will cause future harm. To fail to act, rather than merely speak out, is to tolerate a status quo that cannot be sustained. I am therefore resigning my party whip and instead intend to be free from any party-political allegiance.” Skidmore was the energy minister who signed into law the former prime minister Theresa May’s net zero by 2050 pledge. More recently he led the government’s net zero review, which was published in September 2022. He has been critical of this government before, and previously told the Guardian the Conservative party was heading in a “very dark direction” around misinformation and climate change.   Related: Conservative party heading in ‘very dark direction’, says former minister   Next week, the government is introducing the offshore petroleum licensing bill in the House of Commons, which would allow for more licences to extract fossil fuel from the North Sea. The latest IPCC report makes it clear no new fossil fuel projects can be opened, so doing so goes against the recommendations of most of the world’s leading climate scientists. Labour intends to oppose the bill in a vote on Monday, although the government is likely to win, even without Skidmore’s vote. Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said: “Well done to Chris Skidmore for standing up to this desperate Conservative government. Their irresponsible, reckless attempt to double down on fossil fuels won’t cut bills, undermines energy security and is a climate disaster. That is why Labour will vote against it on Monday.” Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative peer and environmental campaigner, said: “The party will need to regroup after Sunak has crashed it against the rocks. Those who see themselves as part of that future should think very carefully about backing this nonsense policy”. Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: “Memo to Rishi Sunak – this is what principled politics looks like. It has been a real pleasure working with Chris Skidmore on climate and he’ll be much missed. It’s a huge indictment of a government that is maxing out fossil fuels.” Skidmore did not plan to run as an MP in the next election, as his constituency will be abolished in the upcoming boundary changes. He has not said yet what he plans to do, but was thought to be in the running to be the chair of the climate change committee. However, as this position is selected by Sunak, his appointment is thought to be unlikely."

        "content": "If Rishi Sunak sticks with his “working assumption” of an autumn election, it will be fought against the backdrop of a bitter US presidential race and will be the first time since 1964 that voters on both sides of the Atlantic have gone to the polls in parallel. Many UK voters pay scant attention to the ins and outs of politics on this side of the Atlantic, let alone in the US. But elections experts have said Donald Trump’s extraordinary capacity for sucking in the world’s attention could help to shape the UK race in a number of ways. James Johnson, of JL partners, who was head of polling for Theresa May and is now based in the US, says a Trump-Biden showdown – assuming Trump is the Republican candidate – will underline the importance of a characteristic that has become increasingly key to shaping voters’ perceptions: leadership strength. Against the backdrop of geopolitical instability and polarised politics, he said “it’s much more important in 2024 than it was in potentially 2010, 2015: strength, and this sense of ‘will you stand up for the country?’ I think the Trump thing makes that more so, because it becomes, ‘well, how are you going to handle this guy?’” Johnson says neither Sunak nor Keir Starmer are regarded as strong by voters – he mentions a recent focus group in which Sunak was described as “limp”. Both are therefore likely to face versions of the “are you tough enough?” question famously put to Ed Miliband in 2015, with a not entirely convincing “hell yes!” in response – but they will also have to tackle the more specific issue of how they would work with a Trump presidency 2.0. That could present more hazards for Starmer, whose voter base may not want to hear the statesmanlike answer that a Labour government would work to build bridges with the White House. The cut and thrust of the US race may also bleed into the framing of issues here in the UK, particularly when there are common themes at stake. Migration is likely to play strongly on both sides of the Atlantic, for example, with both Trump and Sunak keen to emphasise their tough credentials. But Sunak may not want to be drawn into echoing Trump’s more extreme and dangerous rhetoric, with Trump having claimed in a speech in December that migrants were “poisoning the blood of our country”. With the two races running simultaneously, candidates in the UK are likely to be pressed for a response to whatever is Trump’s most recent, most outrageous pronouncement. That may be particularly challenging for Sunak, who wants to claim he will “stop the boats” without alienating too many small-c Conservative voters in blue wall seats where the Liberal Democrats are snapping at the Tories’ heels. “Trump polarises the argument so much, it makes those more culturally conservative positions quite risky,” says Johnson. Prof Rob Ford, an elections expert at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, agrees. “You might think: ‘Trump’s going to say things about immigration, maybe that’s good for Sunak’ – but let’s think about the kinds of things he’s likely to say. It’s not necessarily the kind of dividing line Sunak wants to be seeing.” That could be all the more problematic for the Tories, given the rising prominence of Richard Tice’s rightwing populist Reform party, which will have no such scruples. Given Trump’s tendency to upend the media narrative, there will also be the threat that parties’ carefully calibrated campaign plans are smashed by big news from across the pond. “All the parties are obsessed with their grids, and Donald Trump’s ability to say extraordinarily attention-grabbing things which then dominate the headlines will be a kind of permanent headache,” said Ford. During the 2019 general election, in a campaign so tightly controlled that Boris Johnson retreated to a fridge rather than face an unscheduled TV interview, the anxious Tories had to negotiate the Trump minefield as the pugnacious president attended a Nato summit in the UK. Trump had previously been highly complimentary about Johnson, on one occasion calling him Britain’s Trump, and Johnson had once played up the pair’s close relationship. But by 2019, deep into the chaotic Trump presidency, CCHQ did not see his support as an electoral asset. Miraculously, Trump kept his views on the forthcoming election to himself during the 48-hour visit – though the British prime minister was forced to play down Nato divisions after a sulky Trump criticised Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, and called off his close-of-summit press conference to fly home early. Five years on, Trump is unlikely to be jetting into the UK as Sunak and Starmer square up, but his destabilising influence may still be felt."

        "content": "When Peter Mandelson was thinking of hiring Derek Draper as a research assistant in 1992, he called a well-placed Labour colleague for a reference. He was advised that his young candidate was “rough, tough and ruthless”. The description was meant to be discouraging, but Draper nevertheless got the job and thus secured his foot on a ladder that would give him a privileged view of the political operation that became Tony Blair’s New Labour government. For just over a decade, Draper, who has died aged 56 after a long period suffering the effects of Covid, was one of the most familiar figures behind the scenes at the interface between journalism and politics in the bars at Westminster, in the dining rooms of Pall Mall and among the cushioned comforts of the plusher Soho clubs. But his apparently enviable career as a key adviser and then, from 1996, as a political lobbyist became instead, as a result of hubris, what more closely resembled a cautionary tale. Draper was at the time a larger-than-life character, entertaining and unpredictable but with an irrepressible sense of his own importance. He earned a fortune, drove a vintage Mercedes and had a well-documented and colourful private life. But a boastful reference to his political influence, which appeared in a 1998 Observer newspaper exposé suggesting that certain lobbyists close to Labour were offering access and valuable market intelligence about government policy to their clients, immediately cost Draper his job as director of a lobbying company and his part-time employment as a newspaper columnist on the Daily Express – as well as his public reputation. “There are 17 people who count in this government and to say that I am intimate with all of them is the understatement of the century,” Draper had asserted of his personal standing in relation to the Blair administration in the newspaperObserver report. Although he was not responsible for any illegal activity in what was dubbed the “Lobbygate” scandal, his rodomontade had profound personal repercussions, leading to a breakdown, a sustained period of serious depression and seven years in therapy. He emerged from this period of intense introspection having secured a master’s degree in clinical psychology at a graduate institute in Berkeley, California, then retrained as a psychotherapist and set up as a private practitioner on his return to London. He also studied part-time for a second master’s from the Tavistock Centre and Essex University (2009). In 2005 Draper had married the television presenter Kate Garraway, the co-host of ITV’s Good Morning Britain, and though he was thus still occasionally in the media spotlight, it was mostly in the reflected glare of his wife’s public fame. Their wedding was featured across 22 pages of OK! magazine and he credited her for having “saved his life” by marrying him. He was born into a politically active family in a traditional Labour party mould in Chorley, Lancashire. His Scottish mother, Chrina (nee Walkingshaw), worked as a cleaner, and his father, Ken, was a shop steward at British Leyland. By the time he was a pupil at Southlands high school, Derek knew that he wanted to work in politics. He took his A-levels at Runshaw college, Leyland, before studying economics at the University of Manchester. His maternal grandfather was a miner and his enthusiasm for his chosen career was enhanced by the 1984-85 miners’ strike. He spent some lively years in university politics and was a traditional Labour supporter in the students’ union, famed, somewhat improbably, for having a poster of Roy Hattersley on the wall of his college room. He worked for Hattersley in the 1988 deputy leadership election and, having established his credentials in the party, was hired by Nick Brown MP as his constituency secretary in Newcastle upon Tyne East. Draper was anxious, however, to work in Westminster and, having impressed Mandelson during the latter’s first campaign as a parliamentary candidate in Hartlepool in the 1992 general election, was hired as his researcher in the House of Commons. Over the following four years he established himself as a figure in the emerging New Labour era, although a cavalier manner meant that he was often regarded with suspicion. He parted from Mandelson to become a director of the lobbying firm GPC Market Access, the post he lost after the Lobbygate fiasco. During this period Draper helped to found the Progress organisation to support Blair in 1996 and compiled a book on his initial period in office, Blair’s 100 Days, which was launched with great ceremony in a fashionable restaurant in September 1997. Asked if he had written the book, Draper retorted: “Write it? I haven’t even read it.” After leaving his full-time career in politics, Draper returned briefly as a part-time unpaid adviser to the then general secretary of the Labour party, Ray Collins, in 2008. He helped establish the LabourList website to promote the party’s interests, but resigned in 2009 after it was reported that he had enthusiastically backed a plan to publish scurrilous fabrications about Conservative politicians and their families. He continued to work in journalism and as a consultant, and published books including Life Support: A Survival Guide for the Modern Soul, in 2009. He resigned from the Labour party, after 35 years’ membership, in 2019. In March 2020 Draper was hospitalised with Covid. He spent 98 days in a medically induced coma before going into intensive care, where he reportedly became the longest surviving patient with coronavirus after 184 days. He remained in hospital, his body having undergone significant damage, and after returning home in April 2021, required round-the-clock care before being readmitted in July 2022, and again in November 2023. Two documentaries, Finding Derek (2021) and Caring for Derek (2022) were broadcast by ITV. He is survived by Garraway, their two children, Darcey and William, his parents, and his sisters, Susan and Dianne. • Derek William Draper, political adviser, lobbyist and psychotherapist, born 15 August 1967; died 5 January 2024"

        "content": "  4.10pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Labour has accused Rishi Sunak of being “asleep at the wheel” over flood warnings at the end of a week in which swathes of England and Wales have been underwater and at least 1,000 properties flooded.   Keir Starmer has indicated that he would guarantee government time for MPs to debate a private member’s bill to allow assisted dying. (See 9.26am.) He also said MPs should have a free vote, and that he would be in favour. The offer of making government time available is significant because, without that, it is relatively easy for MPs opposed to a backbench bill to use filibustering to ensure it never passes.   Rishi Sunak has declined an invitation to criticise the Conservative MP who said most of the children struggling in the MP’s town were “products of crap parents”. (See 12.49pm.)   Tributes have poured in for Derek Draper, the political lobbyist turned psychotherapist and husband of the TV presenter Kate Garraway, who has died at the age of 56. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband has become the latest senior party figure to express his condolences. He published this message on X:   I am deeply sorry to hear of the death of Derek Draper. He was someone of deep intelligence, values and wit who was the life and soul of the many worlds he inhabited, including politics. I first met Derek 30 years ago and like anyone who met him I was drawn into his orbit by his charisma and love of life. He was a loyal and good friend to so many. The last few years have been a living nightmare for him and his family. All of my deepest condolences go out to Kate, Darcey and Billy and all his family.

Updated at 4.34pm GMT    3.18pm GMT   Rishi Sunak has also been visiting Altrincham and Sale West, where the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, is standing down at the next election. Brady had a majority of 6,139 at the last election. Even in 1997 it stayed Tory.  Updated at 8.52pm GMT    2.58pm GMT  Reeves says NatWest boss who said it was not hard to get mortgage is 'out of touch' with reality  In her GB News interview, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, also criticised Sir Howard Davies, the chair of NatWest, for saying it is not hard to get a mortgage now. As Mark Sweney reports, Davies told the Today programme this morning it was not “that difficult” to get on the property ladder, despite the number of first-time buyers with a mortgage falling to the lowest level in a decade. “I don’t think it is that difficult at the moment,” Davies said. When pressed about this assertion, he added: “You have to save, and that is the way it always used to be.”   Related: Not that difficult to buy a home in UK, claims NatWest chair   When asked for her response, Reeves said:  I don’t think those comments are in tune with the reality faced by millions of people in Britain. There are many people who do own their own home but are struggling with the higher mortgage costs. And there are many people who are struggling to get on the housing ladder because of higher interest rates, which were brought about because of Liz Truss and the Conservative party’s management of the economy. So, I know that many, many people will find those remarks quite out of touch with the situation that they and their family face.   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    2.37pm GMT  Reeves says she would like taxes for working people to be lower  Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has been campaigning in Wellingborough today ahead of the byelection triggered by the recall petition against Peter Bone, who won the seat for the Tories in 2019 with a majority of 18,540. In an interview with GB News she said she would like to see taxes lower. Asked if she would cut taxes as chancellor, she replied:  My instinct is that taxes on working people should be lower than they are today. We’ve had 25 Tory tax rises in this parliament and this year an average working family is going to be paying £1,200 more in tax. That doesn’t sit comfortably with me. I would like taxes on working people to be lower. But this is one thing I’m not going to do, I’m not going to make any unfunded commitments to reduce tax because that’s what Liz Truss and the Conservatives did just over a year ago and that ended up pushing up mortgage rates, which meant that working people are worse off, not better off as a result.  Asked if Labour would reduce taxation as a proportion of GDP by the end of its first term in office, she replied:  I would like taxes on working people to be lower. I’d like people to have more of their own money in their pockets to spend in the way that they choose. But to be able to do that in a way that’s affordable, sustainable and fair, you’ve got to grow the economy. And that’s why all of my plans, all of Keir [Starmer’s] plans, are focused on getting that economic growth.  This is more or less exactly what Keir Starmer said at his Q&A with journalists yesterday.

There were also calls for him to resign and “leave now”. Sunak had been in the cafe meeting Conservative activists from the Hazel Grove constituency, where the party is defending a 4,423 majority over the Liberal Democrats. The video suggests only a very small number of people were shouting at Sunak. But they seem to be ordinary members of the public who were passing by, rather than political activists who had turned up especially to protest.

The opposition parties have accused Sunak of not taking the crisis seriously enough. Labour said in a statement that Sunak had been “asleep at the wheel and must act now or risk further damage to lives and livelihoods”. The Liberal Democrats said Sunak should have been visiting flood victims today (see 10.59am). In a broadcast interview this morning, asked about the government’s response to the flooding, Sunak said:  I spoke to people in the East Midlands yesterday who had been affected and talking to them about how devastating the impact of flooding is. I just want people to be reassured that the Environment Agency has got people on the ground in all the affected areas, also hundreds of high volume pumps are in practice right now making a difference and it is important that people follow the advice that has been given in local areas where there are flood warnings that have been given. People should be reassured. The Environment Agency have people on the ground everywhere, absolutely recognise the urgency of what is happening and they are responding appropriately and with all due haste.

James Daly, the MP for Bury North, made the comment in a newspaper interview published last week. Today, asked if he agreed with Daly while he was on a visit to Stockport, Sunak ignored the question and said:  No one wants to see any child grow up in poverty. I certainly don’t. The best way we can help families is to make sure that those parents are in great jobs and are well-paid and that we are cutting their taxes. That is exactly what we are doing, starting from tomorrow.  Asked what explanation he had for almost a quarter of children in Bury growing up in poverty, if it was not “crap” parenting, Sunak replied:  All the evidence and the research shows that the best way to ensure that children don’t grow up in poverty is to make sure that they are not growing up in a household where no one is working. A child where neither of their parents are working are five times more likely to grow up in poverty. No one wants to see that. And that is why it is important that we create fantastic jobs for parents everywhere, that we make it easier for those parents to get those jobs, which is why we are investing in childcare and in particular the largest expansion of childcare that we have ever seen, and also to make sure that those jobs are well-paid. The national living wage is going up an almost record amount in the spring, it has already gone up a record amount in the past year, and we are now cutting people’s taxes, a £450 tax cut for an average person in work, kicking in tomorrow.

This also says something very special about Derek. He was a tough sometimes ruthless political operative, a brilliant adviser and someone you always wanted on your side. But underneath that tough exterior he was a loving, kind, generous and good natured man you wanted as a friend.

Such a sad loss.— Joe Murphy (@JoeMurphyLondon) January 5, 2024  From my colleague Owen Jones  I’m so sad to hear about this. Derek Draper came from a different Labour tradition to me, but he was always really charming, intellectually curious and mischievous. All my thoughts with the really lovely Kate Garraway, who gave everything to care for him. They were clearly completely in love to the very end.

The news was announced by his wife, the Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway. Draper had been extremely ill ever since getting Covid soon after the pandemic struck. Although he was best known in recent years because of his marriage to Garraway, who cared for him through his debilitating illness, in the political world he first became prominent as a New Labour spin doctor, working for Peter Mandelson before the party won the 1997 election. Subsequently he was embroiled in one of the party’s first lobbying scandals. At that stage he was a lobbyist, and he was caught boasting: “There are 17 people who count in this government, and to say I am intimate with all of them is the understatement of the century.” Like his former boss, Draper staged a comeback as a political operative – only to resign from another post in 2009, after being linked to the Damian McBride smear scandal. In a post on Instagram Garraway said:  I’m sad to have to tell you all that my darling husband Derek has passed away. As some of you may know he has been critically ill following a cardiac arrest in early December which, because of the damage inflicted by Covid in March 2020, led to further complications. Derek was surrounded by his family in his final days and I was by his side holding his hand throughout the last long hours and when he passed. I have so much more to say, and of course I will do so in due course, but for now I just want to thank all the medical teams who fought so hard to save him and to make his final moments as comfortable and dignified as possible. Sending so much love and thanks to all of you who have so generously given our family so much support. Rest gently and peacefully now Derek, my love, I was so lucky to have you in my life.

A reader asks:  Genuine question. Why would a bill for assisted dying need to be a private member’s bill? Surely the government of the day can table it and then allow a free vote anyway?  That’s a good question. In practice, there is no reason why the government shouldn’t make it a government bill – subject to a free vote. In some respects that would be preferable because government departments are more inclined to work on government bills (although in practice they do help out with private members’ bills, when they are on matters that have government support) and this is an area where you would want to be sure the legislation was legally robust. That means you would want it drafted by parliamentary counsel, the lawyers who write government bills, not some random backbencher. But Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have both said recently any change on assisted dying should be via a private member’s bill. And that is what leaders normally say on proposals to change the law on “conscience matters” – matters traditionally subject to a free vote, normally because they involve moral choices problematic for some religious groups. Partly they are saying this because, generally, this is what always happens. “This is the way we have always done it” is a surprisingly powerful argument in Westminster politics – despite, rationally, being a very bad one. The landmark liberal changes introduced by the Wilson government in the late 1960s – legalisation of abortion, divorce reform, partial legalisation of homosexuality etc – were private members’ bills. (When the abortion law was revised in 1990, with the 28-week limit reduce to 24 weeks, it was still a free vote, but this time they were voting an amendment to a government bill.) But the reason these were private members’ bills in the 1960s was because Harold Wilson was wary of adopting them as official government/Labour causes, and the same argument applies today. Starmer would be happy for MPs to back assisted dying. But he might be more nervous about Labour adopting that as a policy, because then anyone opposed to the idea would have a good reason not to vote for his party. In theory, making it a government bill subject to a free vote ought to neutralise that line of attack, but in practice it wouldn’t, because opponents would just say it was a government bill. If Starmer were to make it a government bill, it is not hard to imagine the Conservatives whipping their MPs against it, particularly if led by a social conservative like Miriam Cates. Then it would become fully party political, and the chances of it passing the Commons would be reduced.  Updated at 11.57am GMT    11.01am GMT    Updated at 11.57am GMT    10.59am GMT   Rishi Sunak should be visiting flooding victims today, the Liberal Democrats are saying. Helen Morgan, the party’s housing spokesperson, said:  The prime minister should see for himself the devastation caused by these floods. People’s homes and businesses have been ruined yet again. If Rishi Sunak actually met with people impacted by this annual carnage, then he might do something about it.      10.44am GMT  Israel alone should not decide what happens in Gaza after war with Hamas is over, says Starmer  During his LBC phone-in Keir Starmer said Israel alone should not be allowed to decide what happens to Gaza once its war with Hamas is over. As PA Media reports, Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has outlined proposals for Israel to keep security control of Gaza once Hamas is defeated, while a Palestinian body runs day-to-day administration. Asked about the plans, Starmer said:  We cannot have Israeli occupation, we cannot have people displaced who cannot go back to where they came [from], because two million have been displaced in the last four months, that is intolerable. I don’t think, frankly, it is for Israel to determine what happens in Gaza. There has got to be much more international agreement on this, otherwise it simply isn’t going to work.  Starmer cited the rulers of Qatar and Jordan as among those who should be involved in negotiating a peace solution. He also reiterated his call for a humanitarian truce, saying he would like to see that lead to a ceasefire. He told LBC:  At the moment what we are seeing is a horror that has gone on for the last few months, far too many civilians being killed in Gaza, far too many people displaced, and not enough aid going in. We all want to get to a ceasefire. So the question is: how do we get there? I think we need a humanitarian truce. We did have a short truce earlier on, let’s get back to that immediately. Let’s use that for intense diplomacy to deal with the obvious issues – Hamas has got to release the hostages, aid has got to get in – and to work our way to a political process for a two-state solution.   Updated at 12.38pm GMT    9.52am GMT  What Starmer said about why he supports changing law on assisted dying  This is what Keir Starmer said in his LBC phone-in about a Labour government making time for MPs to fully debate a private member’s bill to allow assisted dying.  When I was chief prosecutor, director of public prosecutions, I looked at every single case that the police investigated of assisted dying … So I’ve looked at probably more files or circumstances here than many others. And I, as a chief prosecutor, drew up guidelines to try to make the law we’ve got work reasonably well, on the basis that we had to protect people from being exploited. But on the other hand, there were obvious cases of compassionate acts, usually by loving family members, in accordance with the wishes of somebody who wanted to end their own life. We tried to make the current law work. I totally feel that we ought to actually change the law. It shouldn’t really be for the prosecutor to try and make the law work when it doesn’t really. It’d be better for parliament to actually change the law. So I am an advocate of a change to the law. Obviously that change has to be very carefully crafted. And I think the best route would probably be a private member’s bill, which is normally dealt with on a Friday in parliament. And yes, I would be open to making time for that. I think it should be a free vote.  Asked to confirm he would vote to change the law, Starmer said he would, “subject to it being the right change”.  Updated at 11.00am GMT    9.38am GMT   Q: Do you think the police should investigate the sexual abuse allegations against Prince Andrew? Starmer said he did not know the details of this, only what he had seen in the papers. But where credible allegations are made, they should be investigated, he said. And that was the end of the phone-in.     9.36am GMT   Q: You want to impose VAT on private school fees. But why won’t you remove their charitable status too? If they keep that, they get tax relief on donations, funded by the taxpayer? Starmer says Labour does not need to change the charitable status of schools to impose VAT on their fees. He avoids the point about how leaving it in place allows them to get tax relief on donations. And he defends the VAT policy, saying schools will not have to pass on the VAT charge.  Updated at 10.09am GMT    9.31am GMT  Starmer says he is 'surprised' Met police gathering evidence about potential war crimes in Gaza  Q: Should the Metropolitan police be investigating potential war crimes in Gaza? Starmer says he was “surprised” to learn about this. He did not know this was happening until Boris Johnson spoke about it in a Daily Telegraph story yesterday. The Met told the Telegraph that it had a duty to support the international criminal court, which is investigating war crimes in Gaza.  Updated at 10.02am GMT    9.28am GMT  Starmer urges government to speed up compensation payments to victims of Post Office Horizon scandal  Starmer said the brother of a close friend of his was involved in the Post Office Horizon scandal. He said it was a gross miscarriage of justice. The government should speed up the payment of compensation, he said. UPDATE: Starmer said:  I did see a bit of the ITV programme [about the scandal]. It’s very powerful. I should also say I know personally some of those caught up with this. One of them is the brother of a very close friend of mine, and I know the mental impact that has had on him and others.  So I feel this very strongly. It is a gross, very wide-ranging miscarriage of justice. Not only was it wrong in the first place, but the Post Office, when it began to be obvious that it was wrong, didn’t do the right thing, which is to say ‘We got this wrong, let’s sort it out’. And so I do think all of those involved at the time have questions to answer.  Asked if he thought Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader who was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, had questions to answer, Starmer said he had not studied what Davey has said on this. But he said all those involved had questions to answer.  All of those who were involved do need to answer some basic questions. Not everyone came through. Many of those who did come through severe mental health issues as a result. I know that personally. Personal compensation has been set aside for them. It should have been paid in December. The Treasury have put the money aside but it hasn’t all been paid. I say to the government now get on with it, do at least that bit right.   Updated at 10.25am GMT    9.26am GMT  Starmer indicates Labour would make government time available for private member's bill to allow assisted dying  Starmer says he would be “open” to making time available for a private member’s bill to allow assisted dying. He says this is the sort of matter that should be dealt with by a private member’s bill. There should be a free vote, he says. And he says he would vote in favour of changing the law, provided there were sufficient safeguards. This is significant because, without the government being willing to make extra time available, private member’s bills on controversial issues like this can normally be talked out. Starmer has said before that he favours a new vote on this, but he has not suggested Labour would guarantee time to allow it to pass (assuming a majority of MPs were in favour – which is not a given at this point.) UPDATE: See the post at 9.52am for the full quote.  Updated at 4.11pm GMT    9.20am GMT  Starmer says he is 'troubled' by breakdown of NHS/BMA emergency cooperation deal during strike  Starmer says junior doctors have a “good case” when they say they deserve a pay rise. He says Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, should be negotiating with them now. Q: What do you think about the BMA saying junior doctors should not go back to work during the strike when hospitals call an emergency? Starmer says he is “troubled” by this. Until now the system for an emergency override has been working well. He says he does not know why that has broken down now.  Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.15am GMT  Starmer says he is 'confident' Labour will fulfil its £28bn green investment pledge  Q: How will you decide what level of borrowing is sensible? Starmer says Labour will put money into its green energy plan, but it will be “an agile investment”. He says he wants to know what the money will be for. It is designed to bring in private sector investment. Q: Can you guarantee that Labour will get investing up to £28bn a year at some point during the first term? Starmer says that will be subject to Labour’s fiscal rules. He says he is “confident” he can get to that figure. But the fiscal rules come first. Q: So it’s a gold-plated ambition, not a pledge? It’s a “confident ambition”, says Starmer.  Updated at 10.05am GMT    9.11am GMT   Q: Will you raise the income tax threshold to help lower-paid people? Starmer says he does want to lower the tax burden for working people. But he won’t make unfunded promises he cannot keep. That is what Liz Truss did. And the economy crashed, he says. Q: The tax take is at its highest for 70 years. One paper says there will be no tax cuts for two years under Labour. Is that your plan? Starmer says he does not accept that. He says he wants to bring the tax burden down, but he wants to do it by promoting growth. He says there has been too much chopping and changing. The year before last, there were four chancellors, he says.  Updated at 10.06am GMT    9.05am GMT   Keir Starmer is starting his LBC phone-in. Nick Ferrari is presenting. Q: You talked about Project Hope yesterday. Was the speech mission accomplished? Yes, says Starmer. He says he wanted to weld together hope with the reassurance already provided. Q: Some papers say the speech was thin on detail. Starmer says every year people say this. Last year he set out five big missions in massive speeches. Then people complain he is being too ambitious, and ask if he can achieve what he wants. And the following year – people ask what he stands for, he says. He says, as an example, he has a mission to halve violence against women and girls. That will be hard to do, he says. But people cannot really complain that they don’t know what he stands for.  “You can’t really say ‘we don’t know what you stand for’ unless you’ve really not paid very much attention.”Labour’s @Keir_Starmer shuts down criticism that his New Year speech lacked substance as he points to his ‘five massive missions’ laid out in speeches last year. pic.twitter.com/abyuhViaZJ— LBC (@LBC) January 5, 2024   Updated at 10.12am GMT    8.52am GMT  UK general election likely to be scheduled for 14 November, expert Sir John Curtice says  Good morning. Keir Starmer will be doing his “Call Keir” phone-in on LBC shortly. We heard quite a lot from him yesterday, but there is always more to ask, and he might have more to say about the timing of the general election. Despite Rishi Sunak saying yesterday that he does not expect to call a May election. Labour sources, who spent the last few weeks talking up the prospects of a spring poll, almost certainly to roll the pitch for attacks on Sunak for “bottling” it, are claiming they are not convinced. In her London Playbook briefing for Politico, Eleni Courea reports:  Senior Labour strategists tell Playbook they still think that’s when it will take place. One senior party official bet £100 last night that the GE will happen between April and June.  But Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain’s leading elections expert, told the Today programme this morning that for a long time he has been planning his schedule on the assumption that he will need to be on duty for an election in October or November. He said:  Now, there is beginning to be a consensus it might be 14 November. All the parties have decided to hold their party conferences rather early next autumn. The prime minister will end the Conservative conference on 2 October. That might be the starting gun.  Starmer is on LBC at 9am. Otherwise, the diary looks quiet today, but Sunak is doing a visit in northern England in the late morning. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "Tributes have poured in for Derek Draper, the political lobbyist turned psychotherapist and husband of the TV presenter Kate Garraway, who has died at the age of 56. Draper had been seriously ill with long Covid since contracting the disease in 2020. Garraway announced his death on Friday, writing on Instagram: “I’m sad to have to tell you all that my darling husband Derek has passed away”. She added: “As some of you may know he has been critically ill following a cardiac arrest in early December which, because of the damage inflicted by Covid in March 2020, led to further complications. Derek was surrounded by his family in his final days and I was by his side holding his hand throughout the last long hours and when he passed.” Garraway said she would say more in due course but thanked the medical teams “who fought so hard to save him and to make his final moments as comfortable and dignified as possible”. She added: “Sending so much love and thanks to all of you who have so generously given our family so much support. Rest gently and peacefully now Derek, my love, I was so lucky to have you in my life.” Garraway will be taking a break from her TV and radio presenting roles for the time being, but plans to return to work in the future, PA Media reported. Draper, a prominent figure in New Labour in the 1990s, set up the Progress organisation with Liam Byrne, who went on to become an MP. After he was embroiled in the “cash for access” scandal, known as Lobbygate, he moved to the US, where he retrained as a psychotherapist. The former prime minister Sir Tony Blair led Labour tributes to his former political adviser. “He was a tough, sometimes ruthless political operative, a brilliant adviser and someone you always wanted on your side,” Blair wrote. “But underneath that tough exterior he was a loving, kind, generous and good-natured man you wanted as a friend. “He was an important part of the New Labour story, at the centre of things right at the beginning. But most important of all, he was a good colleague and great friend. And we will miss him deeply.”  Another former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, wrote on social media: “I will remember him as brilliant, creative and multitalented, and our thoughts are with Kate, Darcey and Billy [the couple’s children].” Alastair Campbell, a fellow prominent New Labour figure, described Draper as “a huge character”. He tweeted: “Very sad to hear the news about Derek Draper. He was a huge character, a giver not a taker, and had so much more to give before Covid took its toll. Sad above all for [Kate Garraway] and the children. Their love and support was profound and unshakeable to the end. RIP”. Draper fell seriously ill with Covid-19 in March 2020 and spent 13 months in hospital before he was discharged. Garraway has previously said her husband was one of the sickest patients with Covid-19 doctors had treated. In an interview in June 2020, a few months after Draper contracted the virus, Garraway told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “[The doctors] have never seen this before. My doctors say to me he is the worst-affected person they’ve had to treat. They said he is one of five cases in the world like this.” By June 2020, Draper was “Covid-free”, said Garraway, but it had “wreaked extraordinary damage on his body and we don’t know if he can recover from that”. During his time in hospital in 2020, Draper was put on a ventilator and placed in an induced coma for several weeks. Just over a year after contracting Covid, he was able to leave hospital and return to his family home in north London, with round-the-clock care. In August 2022 he was taken to hospital with sepsis but pulled through. Then in early December 2023, Draper had a heart attack and was taken to hospital again. In 2021, Garraway, a Good Morning Britain presenter, won a National Television award for the documentary Finding Derek, about her family’s experience during the pandemic. The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, wrote on X: “So sad to hear this news this morning. When I was a student at Manchester, Derek was still talked about around University of Manchester. When I met him I always found him thoughtful and kind, quite different to his public image at the time. Prayers for him and his family.” Long Covid is still not well understood: the condition is still being studied and the NHS has set up services to help those worst affected. But according to data released by the Office for National Statistics in February last year, the last dataset available, about six in 10 people with long Covid in the UK were likely to have had symptoms for a year or more. The data also revealed an estimated 2 million people living in private households in the UK were experiencing self-reported long Covid, with symptoms including extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell, muscle aches, problems with memory and concentration, chest pain, insomnia, and heart and lung problems. Other common features include joint pain, depression, anxiety, diarrhoea, stomach aches and loss of appetite. Garraway and Draper married in 2005 and have two children."

        "content": "Keir Starmer has downgraded his target of spending £28bn a year on green investment schemes in the next parliament to an “ambition”, in the latest sign of the Labour leader backing away from his flagship green policy. Starmer said on Friday he wanted to reach the £28bn figure by the second half of the parliament if Labour won the next election, but could not guarantee that he would be able to do so. His comments are the clearest admission yet that Labour is willing to spend less if it means keeping its promise to get debt falling as a proportion of economic output. Speaking during a listener phone-in on LBC radio, Starmer said: “[The £28bn plan] is subject to our fiscal rules, it’s an ambition. One of the rules is that debt has to be falling as a percentage of GDP. “I’m confident. We’re talking about where we might be in 2027. So being a careful and cautious former lawyer, I know that the world can change. Four or five years ago, we didn’t know we were going to hit Covid or Ukraine. I’m confident that we can get to that figure [but] in the end, the fiscal rule comes first.”   Related: Labour’s energy advisers warn against watering down £28bn green investment   Asked by LBC’s Nick Ferrari whether the figure was a pledge or a “gold-plated ambition”, Starmer said: “It’s a confident ambition.” The Labour leader has put green investment at the heart of his policy pitch to voters, promising to decarbonise Britain’s power sector by 2030. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, announced in 2021 that this would be achieved in part by the government spending £28bn a year until 2030 on technologies such as battery power and electric vehicles. In recent months, however, Reeves and Starmer have dialled down the ambition of the plan. Reeves announced last year a Labour government would only hit the £28bn target in the second half of a parliament, and would borrow less to avoid missing its fiscal targets. Starmer said on Thursday that the party would not borrow the full amount of money if it meant missing the debt target, but appeared to leave open the possibility he would tax more or find the money from other parts of government spending. His comments on Friday appear to confirm, however, that he is happy to miss the spending target to protect the debt rule. Labour has said it will take into account the £8bn the government has already pledged towards green schemes, leaving it to find an extra £20bn by the end of the parliament. Economists estimate that at the end of the current five-year period there is room to borrow an extra £13bn while still having debt falling as a proportion of GDP. Labour insists that once it gets into government the “headroom” will grow because of its pro-growth policies. If that does not happen, however, it will mean the party only has enough space to fund about two-thirds of its plan. Party officials are locked in talks over how they should present the reshaped green investment programme to voters as Starmer embarks on a national tour of British towns talking to voters. Some believe he should be more explicit about dropping the £28bn figure altogether, while others say doing so would leave him open to accusations that his promises cannot be trusted."

        "content": "Keir Starmer has promised to “fight fire with fire” against Conservative attacks this year, setting up what is likely to be one of the longest and most bruising general election campaigns in recent history. The Labour leader said on Thursday he would not shy away from aggressive campaign tactics, hours after Sunak indicated he was planning to go to the polls in the second half of the year. “If the government want to put fire into their attacks, we will meet their fire with fire, because the stakes at this election are so high for working people,” Starmer told Sky News after his new year speech in Bristol. “They will go low. What I’m saying is if they want to go with fire into this election, we will meet their fire with fire.” Labour and the Conservatives are sharpening their attacks on each other in advance of the campaign to come. On Thursday, Sunak gave his clearest indication yet of the election date, saying it was his “working assumption” that he would call it later in the year , after weeks of speculation that he might do so in May instead. “I want to keep going, managing the economy well and cutting people’s taxes, but I also want to keep tackling illegal migration,” Sunak said. “I’ve got lots to get on with and I’m determined to keep delivering for the British people.” Labour officials dismissed Sunak’s comments as misdirection, insisting they would continue planning for a spring election. “Nothing has changed,” said a senior party official. “Sunak doesn’t want to tie himself in. But if my son told me his working assumption was that he would get his homework done today, I would not take that seriously.” Starmer accused the prime minister of “squatting in Downing Street for months on end, dithering and delaying while the country wants change”. “We’re ready for a general election, I think the country’s ready for a general election,” he told the BBC. “The prime minister is now hinting, without setting a date, that it might be later in the year. What’s he hiding? Why can’t he set a date?” Conservative MPs, however, believe Sunak is serious about waiting until almost the last minute to call a vote that could see him ejected from Downing Street. “I think he’s right to push it,” said one. “Yes, things are likely to get worse in the year to come. But still, you don’t walk into certain death – even if there is the prospect of worse death down the road.” Senior Tory sources said the party had not even yet set a deadline for completing its manifesto, adding further weight to Sunak’s claims to be aiming for an autumn election. Labour enters the election year 18 points ahead in the polls, but with big questions outstanding over how it would govern if elected. Party officials are wrangling over significant policy issues such as whether to remain committed to their pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment by the end of the next parliament. Starmer defended the party’s green credentials on Thursday, but admitted the £28bn pledge would be at risk if it stopped Labour bringing down government debt levels. He added that the party’s main ambition was to decarbonise Britain’s power sector by 2030, though experts doubt whether that can be achieved without the scale of public investment the party has previously promised. The Labour leader added that his government would bring hope to a “downtrodden” country, adding: “To truly defeat this miserabilist Tory project, we must crush their politics of divide and decline with a new Project Hope.” His later comments about the tone of the campaign, however, hint at the intensity of the political attacks that are likely to feature prominently during the year to come. Starmer said in his speech he expected the Conservatives to unleash a “gauntlet of fear” before the election. The Tories have been poring over Starmer’s record as a human rights lawyer and director of public prosecution for material to use against him. Recent press stories have focused on how Starmer acted for the radical cleric Abu Qatada in his 2008 bid to avoid deportation to Jordan, and how he defended a convicted arsonist accused of terrorising his family. The Conservatives have also been keen to highlight issues of culture and identity, including asylum and trans rights, in an effort to put Labour on the wrong side of public opinion. Meanwhile Starmer has defended a Labour advertisement last year which accused Sunak of not supporting the incarceration of adults convicted of sexually abusing children. David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, described that attack as “gutter” politics. The attacks have become so intense that Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, recently called for political leaders to avoid divisive tactics. “We have to say: ‘My opponent is never my enemy. My opponent is always my fellow human being. We disagree profoundly, we disagree on incredibly important things, but they’re human,’” he told the BBC in December. Starmer will now spend the next few weeks touring the country holding question-and-answer sessions in a series of mid-sized towns as he takes his pitch to the country, while Sunak will hold a similar event on Friday in the north-west."

        "content": "The Curious Incident of the Dog That Didn’t Bark in the Night-time. Exactly a year ago today, Rishi Sunak began the first of his many relaunches with a speech in which he announced his five pledges. Pledges that were downgraded over the course of the next few months first to promises and then to vague aspirations. Pledges that had been chosen not because they were hard, but because they weren’t. Come 2024, he would be able to boast that he wasn’t a complete failure. Now the election year is upon us and … nada. Normally a prime minister would choose to mark the occasion with a big set-piece speech. A few Tory donors and supporters to make up the numbers and loads of hacks to report every word. A live TV feed to every news network. This month, not so much. It’s almost as if Sunak is ashamed of his record and is trying to slip under the radar. His latest relaunch – the softest of soft relaunches – shrouded in secrecy. A private performance for his own benefit.  Then it’s not as if Rish! has any good news to impart. The only one of his five pledges he has delivered on is to halve inflation. And that was nothing to do with him. Just a fall in global energy prices. So he’s left with four crosses on the scorecard. Even the diehard Tory media, conditioned to see the best in everything Sunak does, isn’t trying to pretend he’s succeeded.   Related: Political realities constrain Sunak over when to call an election   So on Thursday morning, Sunak snuck out of Downing Street with no media in tow to meet a group of bewildered people in a Nottinghamshire youth centre. Rish! tried to inject some positivity into the occasion. Look on the bright side, he said. 2024 was going to be marginally better than 2023. Hooray! Though that wasn’t what many economists were saying. They all thought the economy was going to bump along the bottom with 0% growth. But hey! At least we weren’t heading for another recession. Happy days. We’d all continue to become more broke, just at a slower rate. Things would still be unaffordable. It would just take us a wee bit longer to notice that prices were still rising way too fast. The best bit of news was that there would definitely be a general election in 2024. Though this wasn’t quite such good news for Rish! as the Tories were currently 17 points behind in the opinion polls. So by this time next year, he would be out of a job, sitting on the beach in Malibu and polishing his CV before his interview with Elon Musk. Still, at least he wouldn’t have to get by on a prime ministerial pittance any more. He could barely afford his Peloton subscription on that. “My working assumption,” he said, “is we’ll have an election in the second half of the year.” No shit. He made it sound as if he had no idea that the timing of an election was entirely within his gift. Maybe he’s stupider than we thought. Then no one had ever really seriously thought he would call an election in May. That idea had only been touted around by Labour so that Sunak would look weak when he delayed it. Come on, lads. Why would Rish! knowingly give up being prime minister in May when he could hang on for another six months? Why relinquish more freebies and baubles? Not to mention the chance to wreck the country a wee bit more to make life trickier for an incoming Labour government. Instead it was left to Keir Starmer to do the big set-piece event in front of the TV cameras. To take countless questions from all shades of the media. Not just the True Blue reporters, as Sunak does. You can almost see the axis of power shifting in front of your eyes. The world turning. The country gravitating towards its new, once and future king. The real prime minister. The speech at the National Composites Centre in Bristol had been billed by many as a further chance for the Labour leader to redefine himself for an apathetic public. To throw off the shackles of the boring facade and reveal the real persona within.  This, though, rather missed the point. Because the thing is, Starmer is a wee bit dull. A wee bit worthy. But that’s precisely his strength. Obviously, him being boring isn’t necessarily a good thing for me. Sketch writers like their politicians to be larger than life, their personality flaws all too obvious.  But the country could do with a prime minister on whom it can depend to do the right thing. So we don’t have to tune into the news five times a day to discover what new clusterfuck has been visited upon us. So how was the speech? It covered all the bases of public service, of doing the right thing, of restoring trust in politics. It was light in policy detail. No unfunded tax cuts, just a promise to switch on the growth “lever”. Now why hasn’t any previous prime minister thought of doing that? But that’s a quibble. The point is that it was all easy on the ear. A few reporters insisted they still didn’t know what Labour was for. What it would do. That was either a category error or they just hadn’t been listening. Because Starmer has told us often enough. His five missions. You may not like them. They may not be very exciting. But they are hiding in plain sight. Starmer isn’t promising a revolution. He’s not that kind of guy. Much of what he is promising is more of the same, only done properly. Done decently. He isn’t a voice of protest. He is a voice of government. And after 14 years of the Tories, that’s a relief. • John Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

        "content": "Martin Kettle refers to Ramsay MacDonald’s 1924 government being the first to contain a woman, Margaret Bondfield, and suggests that the lesson to be learned by the current Labour leadership from that administration is not to be doctrinaire (How should Keir Starmer take on 2024? By looking back a century to Labour’s first government, 28 December).  It would seem that Keir Starmer has already taken this very much to heart. But what lessons might be learned from the 1929 Labour government, in which Bondfield served in cabinet, as minister of labour? It was a government that, in thrall to the prevailing economic orthodoxy of upholding the gold standard at all costs, was broken by its proposal to cut unemployment benefit by 10%. Arguably one of the most important lessons from this government is the importance of being prepared to challenge such prevailing orthodoxy. When MacDonald, still head of the incoming national government, did go off the gold standard and asked Ernest Harvey, the governor of the Bank of England, what the consequences of the “upset” would be, he was told that the only people who would really “feel it heavily” would be “wealthy financiers”. Please let any incoming Labour government today think long and hard before being lured into neglecting the adequate funding of vital public services and benefits by pursuing an economic orthodoxy, the main beneficiaries of which are a similar small and disproportionately wealthy group.Dr Lynda MountfordSt Albans • It was good to see Ramsay MacDonald’s much underrated contribution to UK politics recognised by Martin Kettle. But as well as being “the illegitimate son of a Morayshire ploughman” (who, I recall from David Marquand’s excellent biography, played no part in his upbringing or care), he was also the son of Annie Ramsay, a farm servant, and was brought up by her and her formidable mother Isabella in a female-dominated household. Let’s also acknowledge the influence of a teacher at Drainie parish school, responsible for the education of “about 70 pupils of both sexes and diverse ages” with the support of only one pupil-teacher and a sewing mistress. In addition to ensuring that all his pupils achieved high standards in reading, writing, arithmetic, history and geography, he managed to inculcate quite sophisticated understanding of the sciences and a basic understanding of Latin and Greek to those interested to study them – and Ramsay MacDonald was. Let us hope that Keir Starmer can form a government with a priority of inspiring gifted teachers to work in a well-funded, adequately paid education sector, so that children from disadvantaged backgrounds have better chances of succeeding and making an impact on our increasingly unequal society.Kate PurcellCoventry • There is something missing from this history of the first Labour government. The main economic policy of the early Labour party was land value tax (LVT). It featured in every manifesto until 1945. The Liberals also supported LVT, but Lloyd George’s earlier attempt to introduce it was thwarted by the (land) Lords. The Parliament Acts thereafter stopped them interfering with finance bills. LVT was actually signed into law by Ramsay MacDonald’s 1931 government, but it was never implemented and the Tories eventually repealed the act. It is a tragedy that Labour rejected LVT in 1945 in favour of a one-off tax designed to capture the uplift in land value when a higher use is granted, rather than taxing the unearned income from land annually. The result has been a growing housing crisis as more and more of the price of a home is land value. The last time LVT was in a Labour manifesto was 2017, when the week before the election all the Tory papers scared homeowners with Labour’s “garden tax”. It was one of the reason’s why Labour narrowly lost. The Tories will not mention it, but in the unlikely event that they win the next election, the plan, buried in a Northern Powerhouse Partnership report, is to introduce LVT and devolve to local authorities to solve the funding problem.Carol WilcoxSecretary, Labour Land Campaign • I enjoyed reading Martin Kettle’s thoughtful article. I have often felt Ramsay MacDonald’s administration of that period should be celebrated more by those of us on the centre left. Labour came into power in the face of extreme hostility from the established order and its cheerleaders in the press. While they had no majority in the House of Commons and lasted less than a year, there was the will to introduce several measures to ease the plight of the working classes, not least the Wheatley Housing Act that went some way towards tackling the housing shortage. This kind of vision would serve us all well today.Matthew RyderBuckden, Cambridgeshire • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

        "content": "Your article rightly mocks the government’s announcement that wine can now be sold in 568ml (1 pint) bottles (Pint of wine, anyone? UK looks to bring back ‘silly measure’, 27 December). If this is as far as the “benefits of Brexit” go then they are very sparse indeed. Using imperial measures in the retail trade is without logic, and this consultation outcome showed that the British people have sense. Out of over 100,000 respondents, just 0.4% said we should use imperial units only, and just 1.3% said imperial deserved more prominence; 81% favoured the status quo, whereby metric is the primary indicator on packaging; the rest favoured metric only. This despite the consultation using leading questions. Metric units have been the main units taught in schools since 1974. Few people under 60 remember learning imperial units properly. How many people know how many stones there are a ton or how many yards in a mile? In metric all you have to do is add zeros.  Ironically, metric is a British invention (John Wilkins in 1668), while imperial is not. After all, the other name for imperial is the French term Avoirdupois. We can now confidently say that imperial units should go the way of shillings and old pence, and the people are behind us. We are pleased that of the three new wine bottle sizes proposed by the government, two, namely 200ml and 500ml, are metric. Common sense at last!Dr Peter BurkeChair, UK Metric Association • You report that the public found “little to like” in the government’s 2022 consultation questionnaire on the reintroduction of imperial measures. Indeed – 98.7% of respondents were in favour of using metric units as the primary or sole unit for the sale of goods. This represents a remarkable result in the face of the questionnaire’s devious use of the word “choice” in its series of manipulative questions, such as: “If you had a choice, would you want to purchase items (i) in imperial units? (ii) in imperial units alongside a metric equivalent?” It was the Henry Ford school of questionnaire design: “You can choose any measures you like as long as they’re imperial.” The result suggests that to express a preference for the metric status quo, other respondents must have had to do as I did: bypass the questions and make maximum use of the comments boxes. It was clear, however, that the government was never entirely going to take no for an answer, and so, in its desperate search for Brexit benefits, we are after all to have wine by the pint. But one wonders if it will find any more favour with the public than the consultation’s unpersuasive offer of red meat by the pound.Helen JohnsonSedbergh, Cumbria • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "published_date": "2024-01-04T17:58:59+00:00",
        "content": "One of the few political powers to rest almost entirely in the prime minister’s hands is the decision over when to call an election. Rishi Sunak invoked that power on Thursday to put himself back on the front foot after several weeks dominated by speculation – often fuelled by senior Labour MPs – that there could be a vote as soon as May. The prime minister told broadcasters on Thursday it was his “working assumption” that an election would happen later in the year, adding: “I’ve got lots to get on with and I’m determined to keep delivering for the British people.” In a day that otherwise would have been dominated by headlines about the speech given by Keir Starmer in Bristol, it was a blunt display of prime ministerial power. But it is also a sign of the political realities that constrain Sunak. With the Conservatives 18 points behind in the polls, having an election later in the year gives the prime minister more time to turn the economy around by increasing growth and further reducing inflation. He can also use the extra time trying to kickstart his scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which Labour officials worry would put them on the back foot over one of the most prominent issues of the campaign to come. Labour, which had attempted to embed the narrative that a spring election is inevitable, seized on Sunak’s words as indicating cowardice. “If he’s not going to set a date, what’s he hiding from the public?” said Starmer. Labour MPs accused Sunak of “squatting” in Number 10, an echo of the Sun front page that accused Gordon Brown of doing the same after the 2010 election. But while Labour is hoping for an earlier election, it might also benefit from being granted additional time. The extra months will allow the party’s policy chiefs to continue honing their pre-election pledges, with internal party battles continuing to rage over important policies such as spending £28bn on green investment schemes. An autumn election will mean Sunak has to go through what is likely to be a bruising set of local elections in May, which could weaken his position within the Conservative party. This will also mean more people will roll off their fixed-term mortgages and begin to feel the pain of higher interest rates for the first time. But strategists in both parties also say that waiting for longer to call an election makes it harder to predict what the campaign will be fought on. “It is very difficult to predict what is going to be the main issue facing voters in six months’ time,” said one. “Joe Biden won the US election on one issue – Covid – which was unknown just a year earlier.” If Sunak does call an autumn election as he suggests, he has a range of options for the date. The prime minister could call an October election, but given this would probably mean cancelling lucrative party conferences, he might choose to wait until November. If Sunak does what some expect and announces the date during his party conference speech it will mean a vote in mid-November. Anything later than that risks forcing campaigners to go door-knocking in the dark depths of winter, and is likely to prove unpopular with the party’s rank and file. One other option remains open to the prime minister: he could choose to go to the polls in May anyway. He repeatedly refused to rule out doing so on Thursday, while simultaneously dismissing such a possibility as unlikely. Labour officials insist they are still planning for a spring election, not least because the Tories have set a slightly earlier date than normal for the budget, in early March. “I’m not sure anything has changed,” said one Labour strategist after Sunak’s comments. “All the evidence is still they’re planning a May election, otherwise why hold the budget so early?” But if Sunak does decide to call a spring election after all, it will have one added bonus that would not have been the case until Thursday: the element of surprise."

        "content": "\n 5.40pm GMT \nAfternoon summary\n\n\nRishi Sunak has given his strongest indication yet that he will not call a general election until the second half of 2024, puncturing Labour hopes that it could come as early as the spring.\n\n\nKeir Starmer has ruled out breaking Labour’s fiscal rules to meet its green investment targets if it wins the election this year, in the clearest sign yet that the party is willing to scale back one of its headline policies in the face of Conservative attacks.\n\n\n\n\n 5.35pm GMT \nStarmer says Sunak should call election now because he does not have personal mandate to govern\n\nAnd here are some more lines from the broadcast interviews that Keir Starmer gave after his speech and Q&A this morning. (They were conducted earlier, but with a 5pm embargo.)\n\nStarmer said Rishi Sunak should call an election now because he did not have a mandate to govern. When the BBC’s Chris Mason put it to him that the PM did not need to call an election now, because of the mandate from the general election, Starmer said Sunak was the third PM since 2019 and did not have a personal mandate to govern.\n\n\nStarmer confirmed that Labour is no longer committed to making ministers wait at least five years between leaving office and taking a job lobbying their old department. Labour originally proposed a five-year cooling off period but, as Kiran Stacey revealed this week, that time period may now be shortened. Asked if he was still committed to five years, Starmer said he was “fundamentally committed to clearing up politics” but that the full detail of this plan was still being considered.\n\n\nStarmer said he would be asking the government “pretty soon” to allow Labour to start talks with civil servants about its programme for government. But it was up to Sunak to authorise those talks, he said. In a report out today, the Institute for Government thinktank says those talks should have already started.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.38pm GMT\n\n\n 5.33pm GMT \nStarmer confirms Labour would reverse any inheritance tax cut introduced by Tories\n\nDuring his Q&A this morning Keir Starmer said he was “fundamentally opposed” to cutting inheritance tax. (See 10.52am.) In an interview with Sky, Starmer confirmed that, if the Tories went ahead and implemented a cut, a Labour government would reverse it. He said:\n\nI’d oppose [an inheritance tax cut], it wouldn’t be what we would do, and of course we would change that if we got the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n\n\n 5.17pm GMT \nStarmer rules out putting up taxes to fund Labour's £28bn green investment programme\n\nKeir Starmer has ruled out raising taxes to fund Labour’s green investment programme.\nIn a new release issued by CCHQ, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, claimed earlier this afternoon that Starmer’s comments on the topic during his Q&A this morning implied tax rises were likely for this purpose. (See 3.10pm.)\nIn an interview with Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor, Starmer was asked if he would water down the plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment. Starmer said he was “absolutely committed” to his mission of achieving zero-carbon electricity by 2030. (See 11.03am and 2.30pm.)\nAsked if he would put up taxes to pay for that, he replied:\n\nNo, we’ve never suggested that. That isn’t going to happen. That’s a misconceived Tory attack. But frankly, tax attacks from the Tories, who’ve just put taxes up to the highest level since the war, I think – water off a duck’s back, as far as I’m concerned.\n\n\n\n\n 5.00pm GMT \nStarmer says Labour will 'meet fire with fire' if Tories resort to dirty tactics during election\n\nKeir Starmer has said that Labour will meet “fire with fire” if the Conservatives resort to dirty tactics during the general election campaign.\nIn an interview with Sky’s Beth Rigby, asked if he would be “going high” or “going low” in the election campaign, Starmer replied:\n\nI’ve made my case, a positive case this morning for hope, for change. I don’t think the Tories can make that argument.\nThey will go low. What I’m saying is if they want to go with fire into this election, we will meet their fire with fire.\n\nHe also argued that the this approach was justified because “the stakes at this election are so high for working people”.\nThere is almost nothing, outside the libel laws, to regulate what political parties can say about each other during election campaigns. The Electoral Commission investigates spending on campaigns, not their content, and the Advertising Standards Authority does not rule on political adverts.\nThe Conservatives and Labour have both been accused of underhand methods in their campaigning. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly been criticised for saying things that are misleading or untrue – including on the asylum backlog, only this week – and last year Labour outraged some of its supporters by running an advert claiming Sunak did not favour jailing child abusers.\n\nUpdated at 7.38pm GMT\n\n\n 4.27pm GMT \n\nPhilip Collins, who wrote speeches for Tony Blair when Blair was PM and who has written speeches for Keir Starmer in the past, has published an analysis of Starmer’s speech today on his Substack blog. Here is Collins’ take on the “politics that treads a little lighter” line. (See 3.50pm.)\n\nThere was a passage in Starmer’s conference speech in which he made this point. With a distant echo of WB Yeats he talked about treading more lightly and here he does so again. It’s the best phrase in the speech and the most question-begging idea. It might be quoted back when Labour proves to be quite interventionist. It demands a whole speech of its own, to be worked out. Does it mean any more than that a Labour [government] will feel different, will be less attention-seeking and more intent on achievement? Perhaps not, but it still sounds like exactly the sort of (welcome) sentiment that almost nobody in the Labour party can live up to.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.33pm GMT\n\n\n 4.05pm GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nI know that Labour appear to be carrying out the “Ming vase” movement and are comfortably ahead in the polls. My question is how does Starmer’s personal polling compare with those that’ve been subsequently elected a year later?\n\nIpsos publishes a table in its political monitor every month showing how Keir Starmer’s ratings compare with the ratings of other opposition leaders at the same point in their tenure. Here is the latest one.\nThe political table also has a similar chart for prime ministers.\n\nUpdated at 4.22pm GMT\n\n\n 3.50pm GMT \nWhat Starmer said about wanting to make politics calmer and less attention-grabbing\n\nThe full text of Keir Starmer’s speech this morning is now on Labour’s website.\nOne of the most intriguing passages, which was not trailed in advance, came when Keir Starmer promised a calmer politics – an end to politics as psychodrama and Twitter rows, which is what it seems to have become recently. He said:\n\nWith respect and service I also promise this: a politics that treads a little lighter on all of our lives.\nBecause that’s the thing about populism, or nationalism, any politics fuelled by division.\nIt needs your full attention. It needs you constantly focusing on this week’s common enemy. And that’s exhausting, isn’t it?\nOn the other hand, a politics that aspires to national unity, bringing people together, the common good, that’s harder to express, less colourful, fewer clicks on social media. And, in some ways, it’s more demanding of you.\nIt asks you to moderate your political wishes out of respect for the different wishes of others. Forty-five million voters can’t get everything that they want, that’s democracy.\n\nIf Starmer delivers on this, it will be bad news for political journalists. (He is basically proposing to make politics more boring.) But Luke Tryl, the UK director for the campaign group More in Common, says the public will be grateful.\n\nListen to any focus group and it’s so clear - after Brexit, Covid, Partygate Cost of Living, the public are simply exhausted with politics. There is a big electoral prize for whoever can convince people they’ll be able to turn on the news and not worry about what they’ll see/hear\n\n\n\nListen to any focus group and it’s so clear - after Brexit, Covid, Partygate Cost of Living, the public are simply exhausted with politics.

She said:\n\nUndoubtedly the country needs change and it is crying out for different choices to be made. It is now critical that workers and communities can see clearly what choices Labour is proposing.\nFor example, Keir rightly says we are exposed on the international stage regarding energy. The choice that needs to be made in order to reduce sky high prices is for energy – and in particular the National Grid – to be brought into public ownership.\nPut simply ‘project hope’ will require serious investment. Relying on growth to generate that investment is not realistic. We have not had significant growth since the 1970s. If we depend on growth to fund all the investment we need it will only result in inertia.\nBritain needs a Labour government – but it needs it to be serious about real change.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.23pm GMT\n\n\n 3.10pm GMT \nHunt claims taxes would have to go up under Labour if it wouldn't break its borrowing rules to fund green plan\n\nDuring his Q&A this morning Keir Starmer sought to rebut Tory claims that his £28bn a year green investment plan was a financial liability, partly by saying that his main focus was Labour’s zero-carbon electricity by 2030 target. (See 11.03am and 2.30pm.) If Labour could not afford to borrow the money for the £28bn fund, it would not happen, he said.\nThe Conservatives are now claiming this answer makes tax rises under Labour even more likely. In a statement released by CCHQ Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said:\n\nSir Keir Starmer today recommitted to his 2030 plans which Labour say would cost £28bn a year. \nGiven his claim to be committed to fiscal responsibility, such large sums can only be funded through tax rises which means more pressure on working families and lower economic growth – just at the time the Conservative government is starting to cut taxes.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.26pm GMT\n\n\n 2.40pm GMT \nSteve Barclay and Steve Reed make rival pitches for farming vote at Oxford farming conference\n\nThe environment secretary, Steve Barclay, and his Labour counterpart, Steve Reed, were making their pitches to farmers this morning at the Oxford farming conference.\nBarclay announced a shake-up to the post-Brexit farming payment schemes which replace the EU’s common agricultural policy. He said:\n\nWe will pay you more for taking part in our environmental and management series. On average, this is an increase in rates by 10% to make it more attractive for you to get in, and those already in schemes will automatically benefit from this. And in addition, if you have a plan to put things together in a way that makes a significant difference, you will be paid a premium for that as well.\n\nThe Guardian revealed yesterday that there is an underspend of hundreds of millions missing from farmers’ pockets after changes and delays to the schemes that pay farmers to protect the nature on their land.\nEnvironmentalists may have been alarmed by his speech because in it he confirmed the Tories would continue the badger cull if they won the general election. Labour has committed to ending the cull. He also announced he was looking at reviewing the powers of the regulators Natural England and the Environment Agency, which he said were “too suspicious” of farmers. Agriculture is the leading cause of river pollution.\nReed gave a bombastic speech where he relished the idea of potentially soon being the environment secretary. He said:\n\nWe may just be a few weeks away from a general election. Of course I wish the secretary of state well in his new role, but I do hope he is embarking on what will be his farewell tour.\n\nHe said “farmers have been abandoned by the government” and promised to tackle rural inequality if he became environment secretary.\nReed also promised a closer trading relationship with Europe and said that 6,000 UK farming businesses had closed since 2017.\n\nUpdated at 3.05pm GMT\n\n\n 2.30pm GMT \nStarmer's Q&A - summary and analysis\n\nAt one point during his Q&A Keir Starmer made a reference to the large number of questions he was taking from journalists who attended his speech. Everyone seemed to get a question, and this came over as a sign of confidence. It was not one of those occasions where the leader just calls the three most supportive reporters in the room as quickly as possible. It would not be fair to say everyone got an answer. But even when Starmer is being evasive, he is increasingly good at doing it in such a way as to ensure that it does not really show.\nHere are the main points. I have updated some of the earlier posts with direct quotes. When I refer to them here, you may need to refresh the page to get the updates to appear.\n\nStarmer played down talk of Labour offering tax cuts at the general election, saying that he thought growth was the “first lever” he would look to as a means of making people richer. (See 12.06pm.) But he also said: “In principle I do want to see lower taxes on working people.” His comments were interesting in the light of the claim that Labour is considering committing to cutting income tax or national insurance in its manifesto, but in truth Labour is unlikely to take a final decision on this until after the budget and much closer to the election, when it might know more about the Tory counter offer.\n\n\nHe said that he was “fundamentally opposed” to cutting inheritance tax because this would only benefit the rich. (See 10.52am.) He was asked about this in the light of reports that the Tories want to cut it, or at least commit to a cut in their manifesto. The plan is popular with voters, even though only around 4% of estates (ie, only the most wealthy families in the country) pay it. The Conservative party is constantly looking for “dividing lines” that it wants Labour to oppose. Labour did not opposed the autumn statement tax cuts, it reportedly won’t oppose an income tax cut if (as expected) that’s in the March budget, but today Starmer showed that an inheritance tax cut would serve as a dividing line.\n\n\nHe said that, if Labour’s fiscal rules did not allow the party to borrow the money needed for its £28bn annual green jobs investment fund, that investment would not happen. He said:\n\n\nWe have set out how that will be funded: the money that is needed for the investment, that is undoubtedly needed; saying that the £28bn will be ramped up in the second half of the parliament; that it will be subject of course to any money that the government is already putting in; and it will be subject to our fiscal rules.\nThat means that if the money is from borrowing, which it will be, borrowing to invest, that the fiscal rules don’t allow it, then we will borrow less.\n\nThe Conservatives have made the £28bn a year green investment plan a key attack line, arguing that Labour could only fund it through borrowing and that as a result it would lead to higher taxes. But Starmer said today that, because of the points he was making, this attack was “utterly misconceived”. He also implied that what matter most to him was his target to deliver zero-carbon electricity by 2030. (See 11.03am.) Paul Waugh from the i reckons there were three tweaks to the policy in these answers.\n\nStarmer 3 tweaks to green pledge.1. “The £28bn will be ramped up in the 2nd half of the parliament” [may not hit it until 2029]2. “...subject to money the govt is already putting in..” [<28bn]3. “If the fiscal rules don’t allow it then we will borrow less” [cd be much lower]\n\n\n\nStarmer 3 tweaks to green pledge.1. \"The £28bn will be ramped up in the 2nd half of the parliament\" [may not hit it until 2029]2. \"...subject to money the govt is already putting in..\" [<28bn]3. \"If the fiscal rules don’t allow it then we will borrow less\" [cd be much lower]— Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) January 4, 2024\n\n\n\nStarmer rejected claims that he wanted to avoid debating Rishi Sunak at the general election. Those reports were “nonsense”, he said. He went on:\n\n\nI’ve been saying bring it on for a very, very long time. I’m happy to debate any time.\n\nThe question was prompted by this passage in an article by Tim Shipman in the Sunday Times at the weekend. But Shipman did not say Starmer would not debate Sunak – only that Labour would prefer to avoid debates. Shipman said:\n\nConversations with broadcasters [about debates] have already begun. Aides close to Starmer would prefer to duck them. “We have nothing to gain,” one said. “[But] if the Tories make a big issue of it, I guess we will have to.”\n\n\nStarmer said he was open to the possibility of getting asylum seekers to have their applications processed offshore. (See 10.56am.)\n\n\nHe said Labour would protect single-sex spaces. (See 10.59am.)\n\n\nHe confirmed he was in favour of allowing 16 and 17-year-old to vote in general elections. (See 10.51am.)\n\n\nUpdated at 2.46pm GMT\n\n\n 1.59pm GMT \nSunak claims he is 'making progress' on his five priorities\n\nAnd here are some more lines from what Rishi Sunak has been saying in Mansfield, where he visited a youth centre.\n\nSunak said the government was on a “journey” towards bringing taxes down. He said:\n\n\nThis Saturday, a big tax cut is coming in, every working person across the country is going to benefit from it. It’s worth £450 to an average person in work on the average salary.\nWe want to do more because, as we manage the economy responsibly, we can cut your taxes, give you and your family peace of mind, immediate relief from some of the challenges you’re facing and confidence that the future is going to be better for you and your children. That is the journey that we’re on.\n\n\nHe said that a vote for Reform UK was a vote for Labour. He said:\n\n\nA vote for anybody who’s not a Conservative candidate, a Conservative MP, is a vote for Keir Starmer in power.\nThere’s only going to be two options for prime minister after the next election: it’s either going to be me or Keir Starmer. A vote for anyone who is not a Conservative is a vote for Keir Starmer in power.\n\n\nHe said 2024 was going to be a better year. He said:\n\n\nLook, 2023, I’ll be honest, it wasn’t the easiest of years, for any of us, it wasn’t an easy year for our country …\nI’m going to tell you, I know that 2024 is going to be a better year. I want to make sure that all you believe 2024 is going to be a better year too.\n\n\nHe claimed he was “making progress” on his five priorities, arguing the economy was outperforming expectations and that debt was “on track to be lower and falling”. The Institute for Government disagrees. The five priorities were announced a year ago today.\n\n\nHe said Nottingham city council in effect declaring itself bust was “a demonstration of their poor financial mismanagement” and an indication of what would happen when Labour was in power. (Labour runs the authority.) He said:\n\n\nMore broadly, I think that gives you a sense of the difference between Conservative and Labour party.\nI’m someone who, I think, people know knows how to manage the economy responsibly and well. That’s why we’re able to say we’ve halved inflation last year, and I said we would, and this Saturday we’re going to be cutting people’s taxes, a £450 tax cut for an average person in work.\n\n\nHe claimed Labour’s plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green energy were “simply not credible”.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.12pm GMT\n\n\n 1.59pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 1.36pm GMT \n\nLabour has put this on social media, accusing Rishi Sunak of bottling a May election.\n\n\nRishi Sunak has yet again bottled giving the British public their say.He’s squatting in Number 10 because he’s too weak to face the country. pic.twitter.com/IcCn5MEq8Y— The Labour Party (@UKLabour) January 4, 2024\n\n\nAs discussed earlier, despite what Labour has been saying, a May election never seemed probable anyway.

I think the country is ready for a general election.\nThe prime minister has hinted without setting a date that it might be later this year. Why can’t he set a date? Him squatting in Downing Street for months on end, dithering and delaying while the country wants change.\n\nAnd Davey said:\n\nRishi Sunak has bottled it and is running scared of a May general election.\nSquatter Sunak is holed up in Downing Street, desperately clinging on to power rather than facing the verdict of the British people.\nWe need an election in spring, so that voters can finally get rid of this appalling and out-of-touch Conservative government.\n\nEarlier this week the Daily Mirror published opinion polling suggesting that two-thirds of people want a general election by the summer. Of those, 31% of people said it should be as soon as possible and 19% said it should be in the spring.\nThe “squatter” claim is another example of Gordon Brown’s influence on the lexicon of modern politics. Starmer and Davey were both referencing a Sun front page that described Brown as a “squatter holed up in No 10” after he did not resign immediately following his general election defeat in 2010. \nIn fact, Brown was just following constitutional convention saying the PM should not resign until they are in a position to recommend a successor to the monarch. At the time of the Sun splash, coalition haggling was taking place and it was not clear who would be best placed to form the next government.\n\n\n\n 1.13pm GMT \nWhat made Sunak rule out spring election, and does it matter?\n\nThe timing of a general election is one of the few decisions in politics entirely in the hands of a prime minister. The normal rule is to say as little about it as possible.\nSo why has Rishi Sunak apparently ruled out a spring election? Almost certainly because he calculated that if he did not do this soon, Labour would accuse him, first of “dithering”, and then of “bottling” a May election (assuming he did not have one).\nThe evidence that Labour were planning this was increasingly obvious. Party sources have been quoted in the papers saying Labour HQ was planning for a May election, based on its reading of what the government was doing (such as implementing the autumn statement tax cuts from January, not April as normal, and scheduling the budget for very early in March). The tactic became obvious when Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, told Sky News last week a May election was “the worst-kept secret in Westminster”.\nAll this prompted Paul Goodman, the editor of the ConservativeHome website, to write an article this week urging Sunak to rule out a May election before expectations got out of control. Sunak has taken his advice.\nDid Sunak really need to? Perhaps not. Labour figures work on the assumption that “bottling” an election can be fatal for a prime minister because it was for Gordon Brown, who never recovered from allowing the whole political world to assume he was going to call an election in the autumn of 2007 before he called it off. But this is partly a misreading of what happened. What really did for Brown was not cancelling the election, but giving an interview afterwards claiming that his decision had nothing to do with the opinion polls. He was lying, and voters knew it. His reputation tanked afterwards because of what people learned, not about his decision-making capabilities, but about his honesty.\nSunak was in a stronger position because, contrary to what Thornberry said last week, a May election was not Westminster’s “worst-kept secret”. Most people in Westminster were working on the firm assumption that the election would be in the autumn. That’s because we think that, faced with the choice of being PM for four more months or 10 more months, Sunak will opt for the latter. All prime ministers in modern times facing near certain election defeat have done the same.\nIt is true that some of the Treasury decisions taken recently did seem motivated by the need to keep open the option of having the election in May. But that is just sensible strategic planning; it did not mean the May option was being favoured.\nPerhaps Labour will now claim to have bounced Sunak out of holding a May election? But they were bouncing him into a position he almost certainly favoured anyway, and close reading of what he said (see 12.39pm) shows that he has not absolutely ruled out going early.\n\nUpdated at 6.15pm GMT\n\n\n 12.39pm GMT \nSunak says his 'working assumption' is that the general election will take place in second half of 2024\n\nRishi Sunak has said he expects the general election to take place in the second half of this year. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a youth centre in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, he said:\n\nMy working assumption is we’ll have a general election in the second half of this year and in the meantime I’ve got lots that I want to get on with.\n\nAsked if he could rule out a May election, Sunak repeated it was his “working assumption” that the vote will be held later in the year. He said:\n\nI want to keep going, managing the economy well and cutting people’s taxes. But I also want to keep tackling illegal migration.\nSo, I’ve got lots to get on with and I’m determined to keep delivering for the British people.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.31pm GMT\n\n\n 12.06pm GMT \nStarmer plays down talk of Labour offering tax cuts at election, saying growth is best way to make people richer\n\nAs expected, Keir Starmer was asked about tax policy during his Q&A with journalists.(See 10.02am.) It has been reported that the party is considering making income tax cuts a manifesto commitment. Starmer did not rule this out, but he did play down the prospect.\nThis is what he said when asked if he would cut people’s taxes by unfreezing income tax thresholds. The question was prompted by the fact that Labour has been criticising the government for freezing them, creating a “stealth tax” by dragging more and more people into paying tax, or into a higher tax band, every year.\nStarmer replied:\n\nI do want more people to have more money in their pocket. That’s a fundamental principle we start with.\nNow, the question is: how do we get to that? I’m challenged on tax all of the time.\nThe first lever that we want to pull, the first place we will go, is growth in our economy because that’s what’s been missing for 14 years. Without growth, we won’t have the money to run our public services … That’s why we’ve put all of our focus on growth and the economy.\nWhere we are going to make adjustments to tax, we have been really clear about what that looks like. We have said what are going to do with VAT on private schools, the non-dom status, the loopholes that we have.\nAs Pat McFadden said this morning on the media, any tax cuts have to be fair and affordable, and we have to be realistic about that. (See 9.55am.)\nBut I think the place to go is to growth on this.\n\nStarmer also said that, with the tax burden at its highest since the second world war, the Tories could not attack Labour over tax.\nLater, when asked if he would prioritise tax cuts for businesses or for individuals (see 11.07am), Starmer warned about what happened when Liz Truss cut taxes – reinforcing his point about cuts only being possible if they were affordable.\n\nUpdated at 12.19pm GMT\n\n\n 11.52am GMT \nCampaigners express concern that Starmer backing away from £28bn annual green investment fund pledge\n\nThe campaign group Green New Deal Rising has expressed concern about Keir Starmer’s comments in his Q&A about his commitment to Labour’s £28bn annual green investment fund. (See 10.51am and 11.03am.) This is from Hannah Martin, its co-director.\n\nInstead of backing down from another key promise, Labour should be pledging £28bn investment from day one of a new parliament, and using the money to reprogramme our economy so that it works for all of us and not just big business and shareholders. £28bn per year is the minimum we need to fulfil our climate targets and reverse economic decline.\nVoters want to see a strong commitment to tackling the climate crisis at the next election. Labour should be setting fiscal rules that encourage much-needed investment in our economy to create jobs, reduce inequality and prevent catastrophic climate change.\nThe Labour party must not kill off its £28bn through death by a thousand cuts. Young people are watching and will hold Labour to account to deliver a green new deal that responds to the scale of the cost of living crisis and climate catastrophe we face.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.15pm GMT\n\n\n 11.35am GMT \n\nPro-Palestinian campaigners have been protesting against Keir Starmer at the venue where he was giving his speech, Steph Spyro, from the Express, reports.\n\n\nPro-Palestine protesters outside Sir Keir Starmer’s speech in Bristol.

And this is my warning. There is a real and rising danger that this political vacuum could be filled by the far right. The polling figures for the Reform party demonstrate already how a far-right populist programme can pull the major parties on to a rightwing agenda …\nPeople will be patient as they fully realise how broken Britain is, but the foundations of credible and radical change will have to be seen to be being laid early in the life of the incoming Labour government. People will need to see how there is a real strategy to restore the value of wages and incomes held back for so long under the Tories, how investment in our public services is taking place and how reform doesn’t mean more privatisation, and how the grotesque levels of inequality in our society are being reduced.\nIf Labour fails to set out early on a path of radical change to secure the all-round wellbeing and security of our people, then inevitably disillusionment will set in. The risk then is the potential for a significant shift in our politics to the right, with the return of a Conservative party, completely shorn of any traditional one nation Tories and under the dominance of the populist right both within the party and beyond.\n\nAnd here is the article (which is a good example of the point made earlier – see 9.37am – about how complaints about Starmer not having a policy agenda are often really complaints about the agenda being too conservative).\n\n Related: Starmer must say what he’ll do in power – if he leaves a vacuum, the far right will fill it | John McDonnell \n\n\nUpdated at 12.11pm GMT\n\n\n 11.16am GMT \n\nThe venue for Keir Starmer’s speech – the Bristol and Bath Science Park – wasn’t the most original.

The day before Cameron, campaigning alongside the then chancellor George Osborne, was on site to commit to lowering taxes and raising the personal tax-free allowance.\nThe science park is Emersons Green, south Gloucestershire, seven miles north east of Bristol city centre, an area currently held by the Conservatives.\nStarmer gave his speech at the composite centre in front of something called a “robotic deposition system for carbon fibre”. Boeing use it in the construction of fuselages for the 787 Dreamliner.\nThe audience included business leaders, Labour party workers and politicians including the Bristol directly elected mayor, Marvin Rees.\n\n\n\n 11.07am GMT \n\nQ: What is more of a priority for you – cutting personal taxes or business taxes?\nStarmer says the focus has to be on growth. Liz Truss floated tax cuts that were uncosted.

And he refuses to believe that these are the only gangs that cannot be stopped.\nAs for processing claims offshore, he says there is a difference between processing claims offshore, and just deporting people, which is the Rwanda policy.\nHe says the Ukraine scheme includes an element of offshore processing. Other countries are looking at this, and he would be open to the idea, he says.\nUPDATE: Starmer said:\n\nThere’s a difference, obviously, between processing offshore and deporting people to places like Rwanda. And that does happen in some cases already.\nThe Ukraine scheme has an element of processing offshore before people arrive in this country. It can be done.\nI’m open to sensible suggestions and credible solutions to what is very obviously a problem.\nI’ve simply refused to back down from my central proposition that I do not accept that you can smash drug gangs, terrorist gangs, people-smuggling gangs, but somehow everybody does not think you can smash the gangs that are running this foul trade in the first place.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm GMT\n\n\n 10.52am GMT \nStarmer says he's 'fundamentally opposed' to cutting inheritance tax\n\nQ: If the Tories cut inheritance tax, will you support that?\nStarmer says the Tories have floated this idea many times.

He says populism and nationalism thrive on division, and that encourages people to be anti-Westminster.\nThe choice at the election is clear: a decade of decline, or national renewal.\nHe says no one queries the claim that we have had a decade of decline, because they know it’s true.\n\nUpdated at 10.55am GMT\n\n\n 10.39am GMT \n\nStarmer says no one is saying that the years ahead will be easy.\nBut this is the only chance to change things, he says.\nLabour will serve the people and grow every corner of the country. It has a plan, and it will work “in partnership with you”, he says.\nHe wants “a Britain standing tall again”.\n\nThat is your future, and this year we get it back.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.55am GMT\n\n\n 10.37am GMT \nStarmer says Labour offers a calmer politics 'that treads a little lighter on all our lives'\n\nStarmer says he is also promising “a politics that treads a little lighter on all of our lives”.\nHe says populist politics depends on having enemies. That is exhausting.\nA politics for the common good is less colourful. There are fewer clips on social media. And it means people accepting they will not always get what they want.\nHe says the character of politics will change.\n\nIt will feel different. The character of politics will change, and with it the national mood. A collective breathing out, a burden lifted, and then, the space for a more hopeful look forward. Because the truth is, it’s this kind of politics and only this kind of politics that can offer real change.\n\nStarmer says you can see this with the SNP in Scotland, or the Tories in England.\nAnd he says he learned about this in Northern Ireland. Originally it was assumed that the nationalist community would never buy into the idea of a new version of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.\nBut that happened; Catholic men and women did step up to serve.\nUPDATE: Starmer said:\n\nWith respect and service I also promise this: a politics that treads a little lighter on all of our lives.\nBecause that’s the thing about populism, or nationalism, any politics fuelled by division.\nIt needs your full attention. It needs you constantly focusing on this week’s common enemy. And that’s exhausting, isn’t it?\nOn the other hand, a politics that aspires to national unity, bringing people together, the common good, that’s harder to express, less colourful, fewer clicks on social media. And, in some ways, it’s more demanding of you.\nIt asks you to moderate your political wishes out of respect for the different wishes of others. 45 million voters can’t get everything that they want, that’s democracy.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.50pm GMT\n\n\n 10.33am GMT \n\nStarmer is now on the passage about cleaning up politics. (See 9.25am.)\n\n\n\n 10.32am GMT \nStarmer says Tories can no longer win election on the economy because that's become their weakness, not their strength\n\nStarmer says, on the economy, he wants an argument about who growth should serve.\nAnd the answer is – working people.\nHe says the Tories believe the key to growth is driving down wages.\nHe says he has read claims that the Tories want to fight the election on the economy.\nBut what used to be their strength is now their weakness.\nThey claim to be the party of business, but they don’t support business. And they claim to be the party of tax cuts, despite taking tax levels to a new high.\nHe says Labour will “close the book on the trickledown nonsense once and for all”.\n\nUpdated at 10.57am GMT\n\n\n 10.28am GMT \n\nStarmer says government is too centralised. But, despite hoarding power, it is also short on ambition. It mops up problems after they have occurred, instead of trying to prevent them.\nHe says Labour’s mission-led approach will mean “tackling tomorrow’s challenges today”.\n\n\n\n 10.26am GMT \n\nStarmer is listing some of what Labour would do: change to the planning system, more police on the streets, cheaper bills because of Labour’s energy policy, opportunities for children, including technical excellence colleges, better mental health support in schools, and the NHS “back on its feet”, with a plan to cut waiting lists, paid for by removing non-dom status.\n\nUpdated at 1.46pm GMT\n\n\n 10.24am GMT \n\nStarmer says what keeps him up at night is “the shrug of the shoulder”, and the fear that people do not believe that change is possible.\n\nBritain needs change, wants change, is crying out for change.

That’s because it is a party of service, he says.\n\nUpdated at 10.58am GMT\n\n\n 10.19am GMT \nStarmer says people are 'right to be anti-Westminster and angry about what politics has become'\n\nStarmer says people are “right to be anti-Westminster” and right to be angry about what politics has become.\n\nYou’re right to be anti-Westminster and angry about what politics has become.\nBut hold on to any flickering hope in your heart that things can be better, because they can, and you can choose it.\nYou can reject the pointless populist gestures and the low-road cynicism that the Tories believe is all you deserve. That’s all they have left now.

(See 9.55am.) He explained:\n\nWhat you can do is cut some taxes while increasing other taxes by more, and that may be what the Labour party are talking about.\nBut what you can’t do given the state of the public finances, and given that both parties say that they’re focused on getting overall national debt down over the next parliament, if you really want to do that, then you can’t cut taxes and increase spending.\nIndeed, you probably can’t cut taxes and keep spending anywhere near where it is. In other words, if you’re going to cut taxes yet get debt down then you’re going to have, frankly, another period of austerity on public services.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.13am GMT\n\n\n 9.58am GMT \n\nKeir Starmer is due to start his speech shortly.\nThere is a live feed at the top of the blog.\n\n\n\n 9.55am GMT \nTax burden high, but Labour tax cuts would have to be 'fair, sustainable and affordable', says McFadden\n\nIn his Q&A Keir Starmer is likely to be asked about a report in yesterday’s Times saying Labour is considering offering cuts to income tax or national insurance in its manifesto. He will probably echo what Pat McFadden, the party’s national campaign coordinator, told the Today programme when asked this morning if this was true. McFadden said:\n\nWe are all conscious that the tax burden on working people is very high. But what we won’t do is do what the Conservatives did in 2022, which is let rip, crash the economy and leave the British people with a bill to pay the price.\nThe tax burden is very high. We are clear that any tax cuts have to be fair, have to be sustainable and have to be affordable.\n\n\n\n\n 9.37am GMT \nPat McFadden claims Labour has set out more policy ahead of general election than in past\n\nKeir Starmer is regularly accused of not setting out a clear vision of what Labour would do in government. But this morning Pat McFadden, the party’s national campaign coordinator, who was doing a media round, said this was unfair. He said Labour had set out more policy than it had ahead of general elections in the past, including ahead of the 1997 election. He told the Today programme:\n\nIf I compare the list … which will be in Keir Starmer’s speech today with the pledge card that we produced in the run-up to the 1997 election, I would say we’d set out more policy in advance of this election than we did in the past.\n\n(It’s worth pointing out that complaints about Labour not having an agenda for government are often, on closer inspection, complaints about Labour’s agenda for government being not sufficiently radical. That is a different charge, and one that is easier to sustain. Labour has announced a lot of policy, much of it set out in the 116-page national policy forum report.)\n\nUpdated at 11.14am GMT\n\n\n 9.25am GMT \nStarmer to pledge to clean up politics with 'total crackdown on cronyism'\n\nIn his speech this morning Keir Starmer will also promise that Labour will clean up politics. He will say:\n\nTo change Britain, we must change ourselves. We need to clean up politics. No more VIP fast lanes, no more kickbacks for colleagues, no more revolving doors between government and the companies they regulate. I will restore standards in public life with a total crackdown on cronyism: this ends now.\nI’ve put expense-cheat politicians in jail before and I didn’t care if they were Labour or Tory. Nobody will be above the law in a Britain I lead.\n\nKiran Stacey wrote about this aspect of the speech on Tuesday.\n\n Related: Keir Starmer pledges to clean up politics and crack down on cronyism  \n\n\nUpdated at 11.15am GMT\n\n\n 9.12am GMT \nKeir Starmer to accuse Tories of taking away people’s hope that general election can bring change\n\nGood morning. Keir Starmer is marking the start of the new year with a major speech which he will be delivering at 10am. He did the same thing last year, with a speech that was heavy on policy, but this one is different because, judging by the fairly lengthy advance briefing given to journalists, it’s not about policy, and it’s not even mainly about positioning, or philosophy. It seems to be more basic than that, because it’s about mood: “hope”.\nThe word appears eight times in the Labour press release with extracts from the speech sent out overnight (or nine, if you include “hopeful”). Starmer will say that it’s an election year, that people want change, and that this should be a moment for hope.\n\nThis year, at the general election, against the understandable despair of a downtrodden country, I will ask the British people to believe in it again.\nYou’re right to be anti-Westminster and angry about what politics has become.\nBut hold on to any flickering hope in your heart that things can be better, because they can, and you can choose it.\n\nHe will argue that the Conservatives have governed so badly that people no longer believe a change of party will make a difference, or provide grounds for hope.\n\nBritain needs change, wants change, is crying out for change. And yet – trust in politics is now so low, so degraded, that nobody believes you can make a difference any more.\nThat after the sex scandals, the expenses scandals, the waste scandals, the contracts for friends, even in a crisis like the pandemic, people have looked at us and concluded we’re all just in it for ourselves.\nA nation that is so exhausted, tired, despairing even, that they’ve given up on hope.\n\nHe will insist that hope is merited, because Labour will govern differently.\n\nWe’re trying not just to defeat the Tories, but to defeat their entire way of doing politics, a mindset that seeks out any differences between the people of this country.\nI have to warn you all, they will leave no stone unturned this year either. Every opportunity for division will be explored for political potential, that is a given.\nBut we have to bring the country together, and have to earn trust as well as votes. To truly defeat this miserabilist Tory project, we must crush their politics of divide and decline with Labour renewal.\n\nAnd he will argue that he personally can ensure that Labour governs differently because of his commitment to public service.\n\nI had a long career before this. At the Crown Prosecution Service, as a human rights lawyer, in my work with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I’ve looked into the eyes of people I’ve served or represented and I have seen reflected back the knowledge that government can make or break a life.\nLiterally, when it comes to work I’ve done with people living on death row. Life and death decisions – placed in your hands.\nThere’s pressure that comes with that, but that’s the responsibility of justice and public service. And it’s the responsibility of serious government.\nThis isn’t a game. Politics shouldn’t be a hobby – a pastime for people who enjoy the feeling of power, and nor should it be a sermon from on high, a self-regarding lecture, vanity dressed up as virtue. No, it should be a higher calling.\n\nThe line about politics as a hobby seems to be a clear reference to Tories like Boris Johnson, George Osborne and David Cameron. But the reference to politics as “vanity dressed up as virtue” seems to be a dig at his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn.\nIt remains to be seen how convincing, or powerful, people will find this. The main news today is likely to emerge from the Q&A, and the interviews Starmer is giving later. But elections are often seen as a contest between hope and fear and, other things being equal, optimism is normally more appealing. That is why Starmer, who is not often mistaken for a shaft of sunlight, must be attracted to depicting Labour as the party of hope.\nHere is Kiran Stacey’s preview, with more from the speech.\n\n Related: Labour election win would lift downtrodden UK, Keir Starmer to say \n\nAnd here is the agenda for the day.\n10am: Keir Starmer gives a speech at a venue near Bristol, and then holds a Q&A with journalists.

        "content": "Keir Starmer has ruled out breaking Labour’s fiscal rules to meet its green investment targets if it wins the election this year, in the clearest sign yet that the party is willing to scale back one of its headline policies in the face of Conservative attacks. The Labour leader told an audience in Bristol on Thursday that he would not borrow £28bn to spend on green projects if it meant breaking a separate promise to reduce government debt as a proportion of economic output. The £28bn policy has been at the centre of a tussle between senior Labour figures for months, with some wanting to drop it and others arguing it is an essential part of the party’s growth plan.   Related: Keir Starmer considers scaling back Labour’s £28bn green plans   Starmer said on Thursday that the £28bn promise was not sacrosanct, and that the party’s main green policy was instead to have zero-carbon power by 2030. “There is no question of pushing back on the mission – the mission is clean power by 2030,” he said. But he added: “The money that is needed for the investment … will be subject to our fiscal rules. And that means that if the money is for borrowing … but the fiscal rules don’t allow it, then we will borrow less.” The Labour leader was answering questions after a speech in Bristol to mark the beginning of election year. Starmer promised that Labour would restore optimism to a “downtrodden” country if it wins the election, adding: “We must crush that politics of divide and decline with a new ‘project hope’.” A year ago, he and Rishi Sunak gave back-to-back speeches in which they made competing promises for how they intend to lead the country. While the prime minister has met only one of his five promises – halving inflation – Starmer has come under pressure in different ways. As Labour officials rush to finish the party’s manifesto, previously announced policies are coming under increased scrutiny to make sure they can withstand the heat of an election campaign. Chief among those is the party’s promise to spend £28bn on green investment projects, funded mainly by borrowing. Several senior Labour officials want the plans to be scaled back in order to protect Labour’s reputation for fiscal prudence, while others believe doing so would add to criticisms that Starmer’s promises cannot be trusted. Starmer clarified on Thursday that the party’s fiscal rules would come first. Nevertheless, party officials have not yet decided what to do if they cannot borrow enough to fund the green plans. Labour could either decide to hit the target using spending from elsewhere or revenues from increased taxes, or it could decide to drop or delay the target. Starmer’s words suggest he is more committed to achieving clean power by 2030 than he is on spending the full £28bn. “Clean power by 2030 will mean lower bills, energy security, the next generation of jobs,” he said. But his comments have angered some on the left who insist Labour’s green targets will not be met without proper investment. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the union Unite, said: “‘Project hope’ will require serious investment. Relying on growth to generate that investment is not realistic. We have not had significant growth since the 1970s. If we depend on growth to fund all the investment we need it will only result in inertia. “Britain needs a Labour government,” she added. “But it needs it to be serious about real change.” Meanwhile, Starmer appeared to damp down speculation that Labour could go into the next election promising income tax or national insurance cuts. He suggested Labour would reverse any inheritance tax cut announced by the Tories. “I’m challenged on tax all of the time,” he said. “The first lever that we want to pull, the first place we will pull, is growth in our economy, because that’s what’s been missing for 14 years without growth.” Asked whether he would reverse a mooted cut to inheritance tax, he replied: “I’d oppose it, it wouldn’t be what we would do, and of course we would change that if we got the opportunity to do so.” He also clarified that while Labour was willing to process more asylum cases abroad, it wanted to do so before they arrived in Britain rather than afterwards as is being proposed as part of the government’s Rwanda plan. “The Ukraine [asylum] scheme has an element of processing offshore before people arrive in this country – it can be done,” he said. “And I’m open to sensible suggestions and credible solutions to what is very obviously a problem.” Starmer will embark on a three-month tour of the UK, hosting a series of question and answer sessions with voters primarily in medium-sized towns that the party is hoping to take from the Tories this year."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has given his strongest indication yet that he will not call a general election until the second half of 2024, puncturing Labour hopes that it could come as early as the spring.\nThe prime minister told broadcasters on Thursday it was his “working assumption” the vote would be called in the latter part of the year, giving him more time to try to reverse the Conservatives’ deficit in the polls. The date of the election is solely in his hands after the repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in 2022.\n“My working assumption is we’ll have a general election in the second half of this year and in the meantime I’ve got lots that I want to get on with,” he said during a visit to Nottinghamshire.\nWhile he refused to rule out calling a May election, as has been predicted by senior Labour figures, Sunak repeated his intention to hold it in the second part of the year.\n“I want to keep going, managing the economy well and cutting people’s taxes, but I also want to keep tackling illegal migration,” Sunak said. “I’ve got lots to get on with and I’m determined to keep delivering for the British people.”\nSunak must call an election by late January 2025, and has said on several occasions he intends to do so this year.\nHowever, the prime minister has not previously been specific about when he planned to do so, leading to speculation it could either be timed to coincide with local elections in May or delayed until the autumn, when MPs and voters return from summer holidays.\nLabour has been planning for a spring election, with Emily Thornberry, the party’s shadow attorney general, recently saying a May election was “the worst kept secret in Westminster”.\nThornberry’s comments led some analysts to predict that Labour was trying to embed the idea that an earlier election was inevitable so it could accuse Sunak of cowardice should he decide against one.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, told Sky News: “We are ready for an election. I think the country is ready for elections. People are crying out for change. And I say to the prime minister, what is he hiding?\n“This has serious implications for the country because he’s basically saying he’s going to be squatting for months and months in Downing Street, dithering and delaying.”\nSunak and Starmer spoke at public events on Thursday as the election campaign starts to take shape.\nStarmer used a speech in Bristol to promise he would bring “project hope” should he be elected prime minister this year.\nAt a more low-key question-and-answer session, to which national journalists were not invited, Sunak attacked Labour’s plans for green spending, saying they could not be achieved without putting up inflation and taxes.\n“We are going to keep talking about it because ultimately it’s going to impact everyone in this country,” he said. “We’re going to cut their taxes and make sure everyone knows that if they ever get a lefty, your taxes are going up.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-04T10:00:02+00:00",
        "content": "British politics risks an unprecedented shift to the far right as a result of public disillusionment if a Labour government fails to enact radical change, the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned. Writing in the Guardian, McDonnell said the threat would come not just from Nigel Farage’s resurgent Reform UK but from the return of a Conservative party “shorn” of its moderate wing and dominated by populists. McDonnell, who served in the shadow cabinet under Jeremy Corbyn, reflected the views of others on his party’s left who are impatient with what they regard as Labour’s too-cautious approach. “The central messaging of Keir Starmer’s electoral strategy is that he’s not Jeremy Corbyn and that Labour is not the disaster that is the Conservative party,” he said. McDonnell pointed to the polling figures of Reform UK, reaching as high as 11%, as evidence of “how a far-right populist programme can pull the major parties on to a rightwing agenda”. It was Farage, Reform’s honorary president and the focus of speculation about a possible return to frontline politics, who had “polluted” Britain’s politics during the year of the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, McDonnell added. But he claimed that the “more significant danger” from the far right would emerge if voters who placed their faith in Labour did not see change. “People will be patient as they fully realise how broken Britain is, but the foundations of credible and radical change will have to be seen to be being laid early in the life of the incoming Labour government,” he writes, calling for a “real strategy” to restore the value of wages and incomes. There had also been a retreat on key core policy commitments, he said, such as the level of investment needed for Labour’s green new deal. “If Labour fails to set out early upon a path of radical change to secure the all-round wellbeing and security of our people, then inevitably disillusionment will set in,” McDonnell said. “The risk then is the potential for a significant shift in our politics to the right, with the return of a Conservative party completely shorn of any traditional one nation Tories and under the dominance of the populist right both within the party and beyond.” Farage has continued to keep people guessing about his intentions of a return to politics, which could involve coming back as the leader of Reform or joining the Conservatives.   Related: The Guardian view on Reform UK: a cult of perpetual grievance with unearned influence | Editorial   Reform’s leader, Richard Tice, told a press conference on Wednesday that terrified Conservative MPs were pleading with the party not to stand against them in the general election and that Farage was “committed” to aiding his party’s efforts. While the surge in support for Reform is regarded as presenting a major threat to Conservative electoral hopes by dividing the vote on the right in many constituencies, YouGov polling last year found that voters who supported the Tories in 2019 were more likely to switch to Reform than to Labour. A Labour spokesperson said: “With Keir Starmer’s leadership, the Labour party has changed and is unrecognisable to the party which was rejected by voters in 2019. Our five bold missions will spark a decade of national renewal, to make working people better off and give Britain its future back.”"

        "content": "One year ago today, Rishi Sunak made five pledges that he said were a straightforward yardstick for his government’s success: “No tricks. No ambiguity. We’re either delivering for you or we’re not.” Here’s a report card on progress so far, with analysis from the Guardian’s in-house experts. Pledge: Halve inflation from 10.7% by the end of 2023 When Sunak made his speech, inflation was already forecast to meet this target. At various points in the year, though, it looked touch and go: by October, inflation remained at 6.7%, largely because of soaring fuel costs. But it has since dropped to 3.9%. So the target has been met, barring an unlikely spike when the last 2023 figures are released in two weeks. What did Sunak have to do with it? Not much, says Nils Pratley, the Guardian’s financial editor. “The job of fighting inflation belongs primarily to the Bank of England. International energy prices – no longer rising – also played a big role.” It’s also important to remember that a declining inflation rate means that prices are going up more slowly, not coming down. With wage growth slowing, that has not yet translated to a big dividend for voters. This year, “expect the rate to fall even closer to the Bank’s target of 2%”, Nils adds. “Despite the central bank’s cautious warnings about the potential stickiness of inflation, financial markets currently expect Threadneedle Street to have room to cut interest rates from 5.25% to 4% during the course of 2024. That is useful for a governing party in an election year. It does not mean, however, that voters will forget the two-year squeeze on living standards.” Verdict: Success (though not necessarily Sunak’s) Pledge: Grow the economy This is a modest target: 0.1% gross domestic product (GDP) growth each year would be enough to meet it, and that is not an outcome most economists would view as a success story. In the event, while final figures are not available until February, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan both say that they expect 0.5% growth over the whole year. But GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter and may have done so again between October and December, which would mean the UK is in recession. In 2024, says the economics correspondent Richard Partington, “Sunak is facing the prospect of a fairly bleak year for economic growth. The Bank of England has warned that Britain has a 50-50 chance of a recession this year, while the government’s own independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, isn’t much more optimistic: it’s forecasting growth of just 0.7% for 2024 as a whole, less than half the average rate recorded in the years running up to the 2008 financial crisis.” Verdict: Technical success against a low bar Pledge: Get national debt falling So far, and despite Rishi Sunak’s repeated claims to the contrary, this hasn’t happened. Debt stood at 88% of GDP in November, compared with 85% at the end of 2022. So how did Sunak justify his claims? Downing Street says they are based on a promise that net debt will be falling as a proportion of GDP by the final year of the five-year forecast, in 2027-28. The senior economics commentator Aditya Chakrabortty is unimpressed, and has a helpful image to explain. “Analysis of public sector net debt can be a tad heavy for the first week of January, so let me clothe this question in something rather more seasonal,” he writes. “If someone told you they were truly, definitely going to lose a tonne of weight in a year and they’d do it all in the party month of December, you might well do a massive chinny reckon (or whatever it is the young people do to signify doubt these days). But that is pretty much how Rishi Sunak plans to meet this pledge. “On the state’s own forecasts, debt will keep on going up until April 2028. But relax! Sunak and Jeremy Hunt will truly, definitely start getting it down then, by making spending cuts so sharp that hardly anyone believes they will happen. As a strategy, it makes your mate’s diet plan look positively plausible.” Verdict: Failing Pledge: Bring NHS waiting lists down Not happening: the waiting list has gone from 7.2 million when Sunak made his speech to 7.7 million in October, the most recent figures available. “Sunak has sought to blame ongoing industrial action for his failure to cut waiting lists,” writes the Guardian’s health editor, Andrew Gregory. “Some of the public may sympathise with that argument. However, analysis by the Health Foundation, an independent thinktank, shows that strikes by doctors had so far lengthened the waiting list by about 210,000.” Even without that 210,000, the number would still be going up. The same analysis predicted that the number of patients on waiting lists could hit 8 million by this summer, and “the prospect of the waiting list dipping below 7.2 million before the next election looks increasingly unlikely”, Andrew says. “Expect Sunak to squirm and pivot with bold new claims of progress. “His go-to at the moment? A focus on 18-month waits. They are down by about 90% since their peak in September 2021, which is not to be sniffed at. The prime minister knows he can’t hide from the big numbers, though. And the fact they have gone up, not down, since he promised to reduce them is all that matters.” Verdict: Failing Pledge: ‘Stop the boats’ Initially, this was followed by a technical qualifier: after promising to “stop the boats”, Sunak said that he would “pass new laws to stop small boats”, a much lighter commitment. Since then, Sunak has leaned in to the simpler – and harder – version. There is confusion over the deadline. This week, the home secretary, James Cleverly, told LBC that his “unambiguous” target was “to reduce it to zero” by the end of 2024. But then the prime minister’s spokesperson said that Sunak “would not set a deadline”. So how’s it going? Well, the number of people crossing has fallen by 36% against the previous year, from 45,774 to 29,437, largely because of an agreement struck in December 2022 to fast-track the return of asylum seekers from Albania. But the Border Force officials’ union expects them to rise again in 2024. “Despite Cleverly’s protestations to the contrary, the lousy weather has played a significant role in the reduction in crossings,” says Diane Taylor, who covers asylum issues for the Guardian. “On Tuesday NGOs working in the migrant camps in northern France reported them to be full of people waiting to cross the Channel.” Fundamentally, Diane says, “the ‘stop The boats’ gimmick won’t work because government is targeting a symptom rather than tackling the cause of the problem. Safe and legal routes agreed internationally, not just by UK, will go a long way to stopping the boats – you never see Ukrainians in small boats.” But there is no sign of the government heading in that direction, even as its Rwanda removals policy continues to founder. Verdict: Some progress, but failing overall"

        "content": "A Labour win at this year’s election will improve the mood of “a downtrodden country”, Keir Starmer will say, as he hopes to inject a note of optimism into what is set to be one of the most bitterly fought campaigns in recent history.\nThe Labour leader will set out his pitch to voters at a speech in the west of England on Thursday marking the beginning of what Labour believes will be a five-month lead-up to the election.\nAfter a series of policy U-turns which have left many Labour activists dismayed, Starmer will insist that the party will change the country should it return to power, thanks to its commitment to public service.\nBut as his senior officials rush to finish the party’s manifesto by the end of this month, Starmer will warn his supporters not to hope for the kind of eye-catching policies they have promised in previous years, which he will dismiss as “gesture politics”.\n“It will feel different,” Starmer will say. “The character of politics will change, and with it the national mood. A collective breathing out, a burden lifted, and then, the space for a more hopeful look forward. Because the truth is, it’s this kind of politics and only this kind of politics that can offer real change.”\nHe will add: “This year, at the general election, against the understandable despair of a downtrodden country, I will ask the British people to believe in it again.”\nStarmer’s speech marks a year since he and the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, gave competing speeches in London within a day of each other.\nWhile Starmer used his speech a year ago to launch five “missions”, which he said would guide Labour in power, Sunak made a more concrete set of five “promises”, only one of which – halving inflation – has been met.\nWith Sunak having failed to boost growth, cut debt, cut NHS waiting lists or stop small boats crossing the Channel, he will host a more low-key event on Thursday, taking part in a question-and-answer session, which his party is not allowing national journalists to attend or cameras to broadcast in full.\nStarmer is hoping that voter disaffection with the Tories will propel him into Downing Street later this year. However his cautious tone on Thursday reflects concern among his senior advisers that voters have become so turned off by a series of political scandals that it will become difficult to motivate them to turn out at all.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n“You’re right to be anti-Westminster and angry about what politics has become,” Starmer will say. “But hold on to any flickering hope in your heart that things can be better, because they can, and you can choose it.”\nSenior Labour officials hope Starmer’s promise to lift the national mood will help dispel criticisms that the party is increasingly offering little in the way of more concrete change should it win the election.\nParty officials are now combing through Labour’s policy proposals looking for potential pitfalls as they finalise the manifesto before a possible spring election.\nThe policy most in the spotlight is the pledge to spend £28bn a year on green projects, with several of those closest to Starmer warning that sticking to the promise will leave the party open to Tory attacks during the campaign. Sources also told the Guardian this week that Labour was likely to reverse its policy of introducing a five-year moratorium on former ministers lobbying for companies they once helped regulate, even as Starmer promises a broad clean-up of government ethics rules.\nWhile policy chiefs thrash out the final elements of the party’s election offer, Starmer himself will embark on a series of Q&A events in medium-sized towns, where his strategists believe the election is likely to be won and lost."

        "content": "  5.30pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Conservative MPs are pleading with Reform UK not to stand against them in the general election, the leader of the rightwing populist party has claimed.   Junior doctors’ leaders say they are prepared to stage yet more strike action after the longest stoppage in NHS history, unless ministers make them a new offer to end the bitter pay row.   Students taking part in the government’s post-Brexit replacement for the EU’s Erasmus+ student exchange scheme were forced to drop out because places were confirmed too late, while others failed to receive funding until after their return, according to analysis.   Neil O’Brien, a Conservative MP and former minister, has written to the home secretary expressing his concern over the sudden death of a Sikh activist in Birmingham earlier this year.   Several of the world’s biggest carmakers lobbied the UK government to try to weaken or delay rules to accelerate electric car sales and cut Britain’s carbon emissions, the Guardian can reveal.      4.13pm GMT   Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, has been busy. As well as issuing a statement attacking Reform UK (see 2.19pm), he has also issued this in response to the Lib Dem poster launch this morning.  The Liberal Democrats’ short-term political game-playing does not address the priorities of the British people. Instead, the Liberal Democrats will let in Labour enabling their dangerous £28bn-a-year spending spree.  What is most interesting about both comments from Holden is the implication that the Tories believe that Labour is most vulnerable on its plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment. In the past polling evidence implied the pledge was popular. The activist and public opinion expert Leo Barasi posted some data on this in a thread on X starting here.  A straight test of the climate pledge finds it gets widespread support across Labour's voter coalition: pic.twitter.com/QbZ9sVmTSH— Leo Barasi 🇺🇦 leobarasi.bsky.social (@leobarasi) May 22, 2023  But Holden clearly thinks that, if he can convert this into a borrowing/tax policy in public perception, he can make it a vote loser. Interestingly, there is some evidence that Labour fears he’s right.  Updated at 4.23pm GMT    3.31pm GMT   The Office for Statistics Regulation is investigating a complaint that the government misused statistics yesterday when it said that it had cleared the backlog of so-called “legacy” asylum applications (those submitted before the Nationality and Borders Act came into force in June 2022), Sky News is reporting. The Home Office issued a press release before the relevant statistics were formally published by the government saying: “Legacy backlog cleared as plan to stop the boats delivers.” But around 4,500 legacy cases are still be considered because they are particularly complicated. There are also claims that other cases have only been disposed of because the government has massively increased the number of applications discontinued or deemed not valid. Rishi Sunak went even further in a post on X yesterday implying the whole backlog was cleared. Labour described that as a “barefaced lie”.  Updated at 3.45pm GMT    3.19pm GMT   Stuart Hoddinott, a health expert at the Institute for Government thinktank, says there is some evidence that the NHS is getting better at planning how to respond to junior doctors’ strikes.

PA says:  Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on board the accommodation vessel at Portland Port, Dorset, on 12 December. An inquest opened by the Dorset coroner Rachael Griffin heard that a postmortem examination found he had died from “compression of the neck” caused by “suspension by ligature”. The hearing last month was told there were no suspicious circumstances and the case was adjourned for a full hearing to be held at a later date. Farruku’s family set up a GoFundMe page to raise £10,000 to repatriate the 27-year-old’s body, which remains in a Dorset mortuary. By today, the campaign had reached £18,784. Farruku’s sister, Jola Dushku, said that the family had faced the “double tragedy” of his death and not being able to afford to bring his body back to Albania for a funeral. She later posted a statement on the fundraising page saying: “I cannot thank enough all the people from the UK, the Albanian community in the UK, and all Albanians worldwide for their generosity in helping us to secure the necessary money by using GoFundMe, to bring back home the body of my brother Leonard Farruku and for his funeral.”   Updated at 2.59pm GMT    2.31pm GMT  Ministers accused of breaking pledge to English farmers over £227m underspend  The government has been accused of breaking its promise to English farmers, with hundreds of millions of pounds missing from the farming budget, Helena Horton reports.

But with an election coming almost certainly this year, and the Tories worried about losing rightwing voters to the Richard Tice/Nigel Farage party, Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, has issued a response to this morning’s press conference. (See 12.41pm.) In a statement issued by CCHQ, he said:  A vote for Reform will only strengthen Labour’s hand – that means a vote for Labour’s £28bn-a-year spending splurge, driving up taxes for hardworking families.  Labour, of course, says that it wants taxes for ordinary people to be lower, not higher, and that it will only go ahead with its £28bn green jobs plan if it meets Labour’s fiscal rules (which are much the same as the Conservatives’).  Updated at 3.00pm GMT    2.10pm GMT   Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, told Radio 4’s the World at One that he thought there was “the basis now for progress” towards a resolution of the junior doctors’ pay dispute. Referring to the government’s stated desire for talks on pay to resume, and the BMA’s confirmation that it is not demanding an immediate restoration of real-terms pay levels from 15 years ago but “a journey towards restoration” (see 9.10am), he told the programme that he thought talks could and should resume this afternoon. He said:  It feels as though there is the basis for talks. But yet there’s this standing on ceremony, this not wanting to move first. Given the impact of these strikes – and they are having a significant impact, we really worry about the next few days – I think, if either side were to act now in a way which reopened negotiations and stopped strikes, then I think the public would be grateful.   Updated at 3.03pm GMT    1.30pm GMT   And Matthew Holehouse from the Economist concluded that the Reform UK press conference showed the party did not have much of a strategy. He posted these on X.

That seems unlikely?   Without defections, or a Farage candidacy somewhere, it is quite hard for Reform to signal a serious constituency intention (even if they could identify a target seat).

The deputy leader Ben Habib will run in Wellingborough      1.18pm GMT   Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, refused to rule out joining a Labour-led coalition after the general election. Asked by GB News at his photocall if he would consider joining such a coalition, Davey replied:  I’m focused on the general election. There are many, many Conservative MPs that Liberal Democrats can defeat across the whole of the south of England, parts of London, parts of Manchester, parts of Yorkshire, in Scotland, in Wales. Liberal Democrats are really on the march, we’ve shown with our historic byelection victories and our amazing local election results across the country, that we are now an amazing campaigning force in British politics.  Davey has ruled out joining a coalition with the Conservatives. If voting at the general election is at all similar to what current polling suggests it would be now, Keir Starmer is not going to need to look for a coalition partner because he will have a healthy majority. Starmer does not seem to show much interest in working with the Lib Dems. By contrast, Tony Blair had a keen interest in Lib-Lab cooperation before the 1997 general election and he told Paddy Ashdown privately that he would like to have Lib Dem MPs in his government. In the event, his majority was so enormous the idea was swiftly abandoned after polling day.  Updated at 3.05pm GMT    1.05pm GMT   Here is John Crace’s take on Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader.

Like a charisma free second hand car salesman auditioning for CBeebies— John Crace (@JohnJCrace) January 3, 2024      12.41pm GMT  Tories and Labour 'two sides of same socialist coin', Reform UK claims  The Reform UK press conference is over. Here are the main points.  Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, said his party would be standing candidates in every seat in Britain at the general election and he ruled out standing aside to help any Conservatives. He said he could be “absolutely categoric that we are not doing any deals with the Tories … under any circumstances”. At the last election the Brexit party, Reform UK’s predecessor party, did not stand candidates against sitting Conservative MPs. Nigel Farage, the party leader, did this to help the Conservatives, but a subsequent academic analysis said the move may have helped reduce the scale of Labour’s defeat. Tice said he would stand candidates against all Tories even though some of them were pleading with him not to put up a Reform UK candidate against them. He said:   The truth is the Tories are terrified … In the new year the special pleading has already started: ‘Oh, please don’t stand here, please don’t stand there, I’m one of the nice guys, I believe in everything that you believe in.’   Tice said he was “very confident” that Farage would play a role in the party’s election campaign, but he said Farage was still considering exactly what that would be. (See 11.32am.) But having Farage stand as a candidate was “the least likely thing”, he said.   Tice claimed a Labour government would bring “Starmageddon”. This is from the Sun’s Martina Bet.   Richard Tice says the country needs a “serious wake-up call” as the alternative to the Tories is “Starmageddon”. He adds: “We are facing a catastrophic cocktail of economic incompetence and cultural pillage.

He made it clear that Reform UK is offering a very rightwing alternative, proposing government spending cuts of around 5%, lifting the starting rate of income tax to £20,000, a ban on “non-essential” immigration and the scrapping of net zero policies.

(Tice a multi-millionaire businessman, Farage is a former City trader, and both were educated privately.)   Ben Habib, the party’s co deputy leader, will be Reform UK’s candidate at the Wellinborough byelection, it was announced. In a statement Habib said:   My message is clear. Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin. A vote for either means more uncontrolled mass immigration. Higher taxes. Longer GP waiting lists. And the cost of living crisis will get worse. Crime and antisocial behaviour are real problems here. We will get dozens more police on the beat and smash the ‘county lines’ drug gangs. Violent criminals will be locked up for life. No more politically correct nonsense.   Updated at 2.20pm GMT    11.43am GMT  Ed Davey calls for early election as he promises Lib Dems will offer 'Tory removal service'  Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, unveiled a poster in Guildford this morning saying his party would be offering a “Tory removal service” at the next election. At his photocall he said:  The Liberal Democrats are the leading Conservative MP removal service in the ‘blue wall’ and beyond. Four historic byelection wins and sweeping gains in last May’s local elections show that voters across the country are turning to us for change. People are fed up with waiting for promised hospitals that are never built, an end to sewage being dumped in our rivers and real action on the cost of living. It shouldn’t be up to Rishi Sunak to cling on for another 12 months, desperately hoping for something to turn up and causing even more damage as he tries to keep his fractured party behind him.  To reinforce his call for an early election, Davey said that he would table a fixed-term parliaments bill when the Commons returns next week that would legislate for the election to be held on 2 May. But the bill will never be put to the vote because Davey was not one of the 20 backbenchers who won the chance to get a bill debated in the private members’ ballot at the start of this session of parliament.  Updated at 11.55am GMT    11.32am GMT  Nigel Farage still deciding what role to play in Reform UK's election campaign, its leader Richard Tice says  Nigel Farage has not appeared at the Reform UK press conference. At the start there were longish speeches from Richard Tice, the party’s leader, and Ben Habib, the party’s co-deputy leader. It was announced that Habib would be the party’s candidate at the Wellingborough byelection. Before he started taking questions, Tice said that Farage was still considering that role he would play in the party in the election campaign and that he did not want to say too early. “A good poker player does not show his hand early,” Tice said. In a report for the i, Chloe Chaplain and Hugo Gye say Farage could end up running Reform UK’s election campaign. They say:  Mr Farage has left the door open to playing a more frontline role in the general election, but i understands any imminent return would be unlikely to see him appointed leader, with him taking up a position heading the party’s election campaign.  UPDATE: At the press conference Tice said:  We’ve been talking over the Christmas period and [Farage is] obviously giving a lot of thought as to the extent of the role he wants to play in helping Reform UK frankly save Britain. He is still assessing that. Nigel is the master of political timing but I’m very clear the job at hand is so big to save Britain, the more help that Nigel is able to give in the election campaign, frankly, the better.   Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.22am GMT  Sunak likely or almost certain to fail on three of his five priorities, says Institute for Government thinktank  Tomorrow will mark the anniversary of the speech where Rishi Sunak unveiled his five priorities for 2023. At the time he was evasive about when some of these might be achieved, but that does not allow him to escape a performance review one year on. The Institute for Government thinktank has just published its assessment of his record, and it’s not very positive. According to the IfG, Sunak can only say he has achieved one of his five pledges. He’s on track on another, but the IfG says that the three others are either doubtful or likely to be missed. On stopping the boats, the IfG says it is almost certain that this will not happen before the election. Here is the scorecard. And here is an extract from the report.  Sunak’s record is mixed. He has achieved his inflation pledge, and is on track for the economy to continue growing in 2024, albeit slowly. Debt is forecast to fall – in 2028/29 – but this relies on implausibly tight spending plans for which we have little detail, and therefore this pledge seems in doubt. Both cutting NHS waiting lists, the pledge over which Sunak had the most direct control, and stopping small boats crossings, the pledge he seemed least likely to meet last January, are off track.   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    11.02am GMT   The Reform UK press conference is just starting. My colleague Ben Quinn is there, and he says there are around 50 journalists at the event – which is partly a consequence of nothing else going on at Westminster this morning. It is still not clear yet whether Nigel Farage, who founded Reform UK when it was the Brexit party, is turning up.  50+ journos await Reform UK’s leader “& special guests” at a posh London hotelNo sign of Nigel Farage (unless they’re hiding him in the cloakroom) pic.twitter.com/JElkAKePp0— Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) January 3, 2024      10.55am GMT  Council tax needs reform because it's 'broadly regressive', says Vaughan Gething, contender for next Welsh first minister  Vaughan Gething, economy minister in the Welsh Labour government and favourite in the contest to succeed Mark Drakeford as first minister, has criticised the council tax system as “broadly regressive”. He made the comment in an interview with the Financial Times in which he defended the Welsh government’s plan to reform how the tax operates in the UK. It is consulting on three options, one of which would just involve a property revaluation, but two of which would involve getting the owners of valuable homes to pay more, and cheaper homes to pay less, possibly with the creation of new bands. Currently council tax in Wales in based on property values from 2003. In England and Scotland it is still based on property values from 1991, when the tax was established, because successive governments have worried about revaluation being unpopular. Gething told the FT:  The council tax consultation is not about trying to raise the average council tax or hit people in the middle or lower scale, it’s about how can you rebalance how that works. You could have people at the top end paying more and people at the bottom paying less.  Gething also defended the Welsh government’s plan to allow local authorities to impose a tax on tourists staying overnight in visitor accommodation. He said this was a “mainstream idea” adopted in many places abroad. He said:  In the future local authorities would decide what to do, it wouldn’t be a Wales-wide measure, the tourism levy would be a choice for different authorities to make.  The only other candidate who has so far declared he is standing is Jeremy Miles, minister for education and the Welsh language. Nominations do not close until the end of the month, but all the other members of the Welsh government seen as potential contenders have ruled themselves out. Yesterday Miles announced five early pledges on X.  If I am elected Welsh Labour leader and First Minister in 2024, here are 5 things I will do in my first week as FM:1. Appoint a government where at least half of all ministers are women— Jeremy Miles (@Jeremy_Miles) January 2, 2024   If I am elected Welsh Labour leader and First Minister in 2024, here are 5 things I will do in my first week as FM:1. Appoint a government where at least half of all ministers are women   2. Kick start the setting up of a new Delivery Unit in the Welsh Government - we will look at everything we do with an absolutely relentless focus on practical delivery   3. Get the review of 20 mph underway, it will be 6 months from introduction, so as I said on day one of my campaign - there’s no need to delay   4. Initiate fresh discussions with patients, health bodies and health unions about how we help the NHS adapt to respond to current and future pressures   5. Direct the establishment of a new National Economic Council to advise the government on strategic policies to deliver sustainable economic prosperity and solidarity   I will be announcing policy priorities in the coming weeks. Today’s 5 actions point to kind of government I want to lead - reflecting our communities, focused on the economy, relentless in protecting and improving public services, and open to scrutiny. Let’s get on with it!  Bookmakers have Gething as the favourite in the leadership contest, but a poll for ITV Wales last year, carried out just days before Drakeford announced his retirement, found that 72% of people in Wales could not say who they wanted to be next first minister.  Updated at 11.04am GMT    10.18am GMT       10.12am GMT   Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, has restated her call for the BMA to call off the junior doctors’ strike in England. Speaking to Sky News she said:  We’re very concerned about the consequences [the strike] will have, not just for this week of industrial action, but also in the weeks following, because consultants and other clinicians who are picking up the slack as junior doctors, doctors in training, are not at their work – that will be reflected in the weeks coming up with people trying to catch up with the lost time. So it’s going to have a huge impact on our health system. My ask of the junior doctors committee is to call off these strikes and get back round the negotiating table.   Updated at 10.22am GMT    10.01am GMT   Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has posted a message on X pointing out that his government has managed to avoid a junior doctors’ strike.  Six days of Junior Doctor strikes in England, all because of a UK Government that chooses tax cuts for the wealthy over paying NHS staff fairly.We have taken different choices in Scotland and avoided a single day of NHS strikes. Our budget gives the NHS a real-terms increase.

He said:  The notion that we’re hellbent on calling strikes, and all we want to do is call strikes, is not what we want. What we want is to negotiate an offer we can put to our members and for our members to accept it.  But he also said the six-day strike by his members in England starting today could be followed by further action if the government did not improve its offer.  I hope they come back to the table now – but from all of the signals they are sending it won’t be until our strike action finishes. And I hope at that point we can come to a resolution. So as soon as our strike action finishes we will be asking the government to get back round the table, which as we’ve seen from what they have been saying so far, they should be very willing to do very rapidly. If the government stall, or they don’t come to the table, or they make excuses, or they try to push things down the line without any clear reason as to why that is happening, then we will be led by our members. In the past when those kinds of actions have been displayed by the government, our members have wanted us to call for further strike action. I hope that we don’t have to go there but I can’t rule it out.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    9.44am GMT       9.43am GMT   According to a report by Steven Swinford in the Times today, Labour is considering offering tax cuts at the general election. He says:  Rachel Reeves is weighing up plans to offer income tax or national insurance cuts in Labour’s general election manifesto to show that the party is on the side of “opportunity and aspiration”. The shadow chancellor is facing pressure from frontbenchers to make a “retail” offer on tax to voters who are struggling with the cost of living crisis. She has said she makes “no apology for wanting working people to have more money” and that she believes the tax burden is too high. Reeves believes that tax cuts offered by Labour must be “bombproof” and should not threaten the party’s fiscal credibility, which she views as integral to an election win.  Swinford also says that, while Labour is opposed to cutting or abolishing inheritance tax, it is likely to support any move to cut income tax if Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, does that in the March budget. There have been reports suggesting a 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax is being considered. At the weekend a report in the Sunday Times quoted an unnamed cabinet minister as saying:  The tax cuts in March will be enormous. Either they work or we leave Labour with a major headache.      9.30am GMT   While junior doctors are on strike, some of their work will be covered in hospitals by consultants. But Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, told LBC this morning that contingency plans at individual hospitals would be in “jeopardy” if just one or two consultants were sick. She explained:  Across the whole country leaders are telling us that this particular round of industrial action, coming at the time that it does, and being of such a long duration, is going to be perhaps [the NHS’] toughest challenge yet … Plans have been put in place and people have been working very, very hard on these rotas. But the rotas are just about covered so it only takes a consultant or two to go off sick – there’s a lot of Covid and flu, norovirus, other winter viruses around at the moment and a couple may go off sick – then that is going to put the entire plan in jeopardy, which is why the leaders across the NHS are so concerned that this is skating on thin ice.      9.25am GMT    Updated at 10.17am GMT    9.10am GMT  Junior doctors want 35% pay increase over time, not immediately, says BMA leader  Good morning. When Dominic Cummings met Rishi Sunak in secret last summer to offer his advice on how Sunak might win the election, he said the prime minister should settle the NHS strikes (presumably by paying staff more). Sunak decided against employing Cummings as his campaigns supremo, but NHS staff were offered better pay deals and by the end of the year nurses, consultants and other health workers had ceased, or at least paused, strike action. But Sunak has not done enough to satisfy junior doctors in England and this morning they started a six-day strike – the longest in the NHS’s 75-year history. As Denis Campbell reports in his overnight preview, this strike is taking place during what is seen as the busiest week of the year for hospitals.   Related: Tens of thousands face NHS cancellations as six-day strike begins in England   Andrew Gregory has a Q&A about why the strike is taking place here.   Related: Why are junior doctors striking in England and how bad will it be?   And Archie Bland has an explainer that assesses some of the claims and counter-claims being made by people on each side.   Related: Decoding the junior doctors’ strike – from patient safety to public support   The BMA, which represents junior doctors (hospital doctors below consultant level – most of them have considerable experience, and would not be considered “junior” in another workplace), says the junior doctors want a 35% pay rise to compensate for the extent to which their pay has fallen in real terms over the past 15 years. But, in an interview on the Today programme this morning, Dr Vivek Trivedi, co-chair of the BMA’s junior doctors committee, said that his members were not expecting a 35% increase immediately. He said:  We’re not asking for any uplift or pay restoration to happen overnight. We are not even saying it has to happen in one year. We’re very happy to look over deals that would span a number of years. But what we need to do is to start a way towards that, and especially not further the pay erosion. That average 3% pay uplift [the latest offer from the government, on top of the 8.8% offered last summer] would still have amounted to pay cuts for many doctors this year.  The government says it will not negotiate with the BMA while the strike is taking place. But Trivedi said this was an unnecessary condition which the government had ignored in the past. He explained:  That’s a rule of their own making. There is no law that prevents them from talking to us while strike action is happening. And in fact we saw this same government adopt a different approach when they were dealing with the criminal barristers. They negotiated with the barristers and stopped them from striking while they were striking by coming up with an offer that was appropriate to put to their membership.  Trivedi said that, if the juniors doctors were not on strike, they would just be ignored by the government. The Commons is still in recess, and Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer are expected to hold their first public events of the year tomorrow, not today. But Reform UK is holding a start-of-year press conference at 10.30am, and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is also holding a campaign event in Guildford, where he will be highlighting his party’s prospects of winning seats in the Tories’ “blue wall”.

        "content": "Just three days in and 2024 is shaping up to be a golden year for political comedy. The closer we get to an election, the more Westminster resembles the theatre of the absurd. You couldn’t create such hapless characters if you tried. Weak, vain narcissists scrabbling around for any attention they can get. Seemingly unaware of the ridicule in which they are held by most of the country. How unforgiven they are for the destruction they have wantonly caused. On Tuesday we had James Cleverly and his technicolour truths. On Wednesday we had a press conference for Reform UK. To all intents and purposes a party that exists purely for the glorification of Nigel Farage. Without Nige, the party is a waste of space. Dead in the water. Of no interest to anyone. Only for this presser there was no sign of Nige. Despite the briefing note promising we would get the party leader, Richard Tice – leader in the sense that he isn’t really the leader at all, just an interim presenter on the Shopping Channel; confused? You soon will be – and special guests. Which the 50 or so hacks who had made the trip to a Westminster hotel had assumed meant Farage. Only the special guests turned out to be even more anonymous than Dickie Tice. Imagine that. You might have expected Reform UK to call the presser off once they had realised there was no chance of Nige showing up to take command of the party that had been formed as his own vanity project. To say “Soz and all that” to everyone who had made the effort to show up. After all, without Farage, there was nothing of any interest they could possibly say. Because Nige was quite capable of contradicting any announcements at a later date. And Reform UK would just lie back and take it. Because that’s what they are there for. To bend to Nige’s will. To fulfil his fantasies. But narcissism and megalomania are the lifeblood of those close to the Reform UK project – Nige doesn’t get to monopolise its entire gene pool – so the press conference went ahead as planned. And politics was at its most meta. A press conference taking place purely because a press conference had been announced. Not because anyone had anything of interest to say. An exercise in collective time-wasting. Time that no one would get back.   Related: Tory MPs pleading with Reform UK not to stand against them, says Richard Tice   First a brief introduction from the GB News presenter Alexandra Phillips – almost everyone connected with Reform UK has their own show on GB News these days. “You’re here because you want change,” she said. Er, no, we’re here because we hoped Nige might turn up. Instead Tice took centre stage. And promptly lost the entire audience. Because Dickie is no communicator. He looks and acts like a charisma-free 1980s time-share salesman. Someone you instinctively mistrust. Someone extremely easy to dislike. Dickie was adamant that people were here for his optimism. Just as he was convinced that he – a multimillionaire from the Isle of Wight – was the authentic voice of the British working class. Like it or loathe it, Farage has a sense of vision. A mission. Even if it’s no more than recycled populism. Ideas without responsibility. The thought of being in power terrifies him. Then he might have to deliver. Shouting from the sidelines is all he can manage. Tice can’t even manage that. Instead he babbled, only intermittently lapsing into coherence. Rishi Sunak’s Tories had betrayed the country and had failed on almost all their promises. So far, so good. You won’t find many people arguing with that. Which was why Reform UK would definitely stand candidates in every seat at the next election. Yawn. If it’s all the same to you, Dickie, I’ll speak to the organ grinder, not the monkey. In 2019, Nige promised to do the same, only to change his mind to give the Tories an easy ride. So we’ll see how this one plays out. Then things got really deranged. The Tories were basically Communists in disguise. And the real threat was Starmergeddon, with Labour culturally pillaging the country. Whatever that means. Just as bad, Labour would bankrupt the UK. By investing in the NHS and worrying about climate change. Net zero was just for woke pussies. Instead, Dickie was offering tax cuts on a scale unimagined even by Liz Truss and a 5% cut to all public services. In other words, he was going to wreck the country. All immigrants would be kicked out. We could get people currently on disability benefits to work as doctors and nurses. “It’s my great pleasure to introduce our special guest,” bawled Dickie. “Ben Habib, our candidate for Wellingborough.” Ben who? Ben stepped forward. His was a tale of Brexit betrayal. The people of Northern Ireland had been duped “without a shot being fired”. It’s unusual to hear a politician lamenting the absence of armed conflict in Northern Ireland these days, but it takes all sorts, I suppose. Ben loves the sound of gunshots. I doubt we’ll be hearing much of him again. The pointlessness ended with a few questions. Wasn’t it inevitable that Reform UK would end up with at most one seat? Much like Ukip had in 2015? Definitely not, said Dickie. Because in 2015 Britain had not yet been broken. Unlike now. And what could have been that thing that broke Britain? Round about June 2016? These fuckwits don’t even think before speaking these days. They literally campaigned for the very thing they are now campaigning against. Their sole cry is that it hadn’t turned out as they hoped. Come the end, Tice was begging – make that sobbing – for Nige to come back. To make a second, third or fourth coming. There have been so many, we’ve all lost count. Farage has fought and lost seven general elections now. To MP, or not to MP? Always not. This was surreal. A nominal leader of a party pleading for a man who could do the job better than him. The man who was nothing without Nige. Perhaps, he mused, Nige could come back as president. That’s King Charles out of a job then. Nige was thinking, said Dickie. Considering his options. You could see the smile starting to form on Keir Starmer’s face. This was all working out rather nicely. Let Reform UK and the Tories fight it out for the far-right vote, each inflicting damage on the other. In the meantime, Labour could slide down the middle. • John Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

        "content": "Conservative MPs are pleading with Reform UK not to stand against them in the general election, the leader of the rightwing populist party has claimed. Richard Tice also said Nigel Farage – who said last year he believed he would be leading the Conservative party within three years – would play a formal role in Reform’s election campaign. The party announced on Wednesday that Ben Habib, its deputy leader, would stand in the upcoming Wellingborough byelection in a move that will make it even harder for the Tories to defend a seat that Labour is hoping to take for the first time since 1997. Farage was not at the event in central London, where there was a large media attendance in anticipation of a possible political comeback during the event billed as “Richard Tice and guests”.  Tice said the former Ukip leader was committed to Reform. “I think you can be very confident that Nigel is committed. He’s already our president. I mean, you could just take away the honorary title and call him President Farage alongside a possible President Trump,” he said. Farage – whose dominant shareholding in Reform makes him a “person with significant control”, according to its Companies House listing – told the Guardian he had never said he was going to come to the event. “I’m honorary president. It was Richard’s show today. All I will say is: never say never,” he said, when asked if he was coming back to assist Reform. Farage declined to say whether he would appear on stage at an event in February in Doncaster, where Reform is expected to announce its candidate list for the general election, but added: “It’s obviously going to be an important day.” Recent polls have put support for Reform as high as 11% and it has pledged to stand in every constituency in England, Scotland and Wales in the general election, threatening to exacerbate the Tories’ electoral challenges by wiping out the majorities held by dozens of Rishi Sunak’s MPs. “In the new year, the special pleading has already started. ‘Oh, please don’t stand here. Please don’t stand. I’m one of the nice guys,’” Tice said, referring to calls that he claimed he was routinely getting from Conservatives, as he reiterated that there would be no special deals “under any circumstances” with Sunak’s party. The Tories won a majority in 2019 after Reform’s previous incarnation, the Brexit party, did not field any candidates against them in the 317 seats which the Conservatives won in 2017, in return for Boris Johnson’s commitment to leave the EU by 2020 before pursuing a Canada-style trade deal. He declined to say how many Conservative MPs or councillors he was talking to, only that it was “quite a lot”, and claimed many “disgruntled” Tory donors were also speaking to him. At the press conference, where he attacked the Conservatives on taxation and immigration, he said the Tory deputy chair, Lee Anderson, was “terrified that Reform is going to put him out of a job”. Reform previously denied it had been offering financial incentives to MPs to defect to it, amid claims Anderson was offered “a lot of money” last month. The Conservatives issued a response on Wednesday through their party chair, Richard Holden, who said a vote for Reform “will only strengthen Labour’s hand”. “The Conservative government is focused on long-term decisions for the country – stopping the boats, driving down inflation and cutting taxes. If voters want real action to deliver a brighter future, the Conservatives are the only choice,” he said."

        "content": "Labour’s poll lead could collapse in the weeks before the general election, the party’s chief campaign strategist has told shadow ministers, as he warned them not to be complacent going into the election year. Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s director of campaigns, recently gave a presentation to the shadow cabinet in which he showed MPs what happened in the months before eight different elections from around the world. In each case, the clear favourite lost after their poll lead disappeared in the weeks leading up to the vote. The presentation, seen by the Guardian, was designed to instil a sense of discipline as the party enters the election year about 18 points ahead in the polls. That message will be repeated by the party leader, Keir Starmer, in a speech on Thursday setting out Labour’s plans for the final months before the general election, which could come as early as May. In his presentation, McSweeney warned: “Polls do not predict the future; nobody has voted in the general election; change won’t happen unless people vote for it.” According to one person who was there, the Labour campaign chief compared being focused on polls to driving while looking in the rear-view mirror. Another attender said: “It showed us what complacency looked like in other countries: a Labour loss.” McSweeney’s message is designed to maintain party unity behind the strategy he has sketched out alongside the party leader, Keir Starmer, and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The plan involves proving the party’s credibility to voters by refusing to make election promises unless they are fully funded, while also ruling out major changes to levels of income or wealth taxes. Support for the strategy is likely to be tested in the coming weeks as shadow ministers tussle to ensure their plans are included in the party’s election manifesto, which is due to be completed by the end of this month. Some senior figures in the party believe Starmer should be making bolder policy choices given the party has such a strong lead going into 2024. McSweeney’s presentation was designed in part to rebut this argument. In it, McSweeney, who is one of Starmer’s closest advisers, showed shadow ministers what happened before a range of elections from around the world, including the Australian election of 2019, the Norwegian election of 2017 and the UK election of 2017. In each one, one party went into the election with a significant poll lead, only for it to crumble in the final stages of the campaign. In Australia, Labor were ahead in the polls for well over two years, and had a seven-point lead going at the beginning of the election year. However, the lead collapsed just before the election, giving the governing Liberal-National coalition an unexpected victory. An internal party review later argued Labor had lost because it went into the election promising radical change, allowing the coalition to argue that voting for the opposition party would be a risk. In Norway, the opposition Labour party led by about 20 points two years before the country’s general election but ended up losing after saying it would put up taxes if it won, in an attempt to improve the country’s finances. The party dropped about 5 points during the campaign, which was dominated by discussion about its tax pledge. In the UK in 2017, Theresa May saw a similarly commanding poll lead evaporate after promising to shake up Britain’s social care system in a way opponents said would mean some people having to sell all their assets to pay for their own care."

        "content": "People who defraud the government will face going to jail for more than a decade under plans being considered by Keir Starmer as part of a wider cleanup of British politics. The Labour leader will pledge to restore standards in public life with “a total crackdown on cronyism” in a speech on Thursday marking the beginning of the election year. Sources say a range of policy options are being considered as part of the cleanup plan, including tougher sentences for “fraud against the public purse”, such as the billions wasted through Covid loan schemes. However a separate pledge to impose a five-year moratorium on former ministers from lobbying on behalf of companies over which they once had oversight is likely to be scaled back, the Guardian understands. In a speech designed to set the tone for what is likely to be a bitterly-fought general election campaign to come, Starmer will warn that repeated public scandals risk undermining voters’ faith in politics in general. The Labour leader is expected to say: “Trust in politics is now so low, so degraded, that nobody believes anyone can make a difference any more. “After the sex scandals, the expenses scandals, the waste scandals, the contracts for friends – even in a crisis like the pandemic – people think we’re all just in it for ourselves.” He will add: “To change Britain, we must change ourselves – we need to clean up politics. No more VIP fast lanes, no more kickbacks for colleagues, no more revolving doors between government and the companies they regulate. “I will restore standards in public life with a total crackdown on cronyism.” He will say that he came into politics “to serve”. Pointing to his past as a human rights lawyer, Starmer is expected to say: “When it comes to the work I’ve done with people around the world, living on death row – life and death decisions in your hands. Now there’s pressure that comes with that – of course there is, that goes with the territory. But that’s the responsibility of serious government, the responsibility of justice. “It’s not a game. Politics isn’t a hobby, a pastime for people who enjoy the feeling of power, and nor is it a sermon from on high, a self-regarding lecture, vanity dressed up as virtue.” Labour enters election year 18 points ahead in the polls, with the Conservative party struggling to close the gap which was established when the Partygate scandal first broke and which widened during the Truss administration. In recent weeks Starmer has highlighted the scandal surrounding Michelle Mone, the Tory peer who is under investigation for fraud in relation to multimillion-pound government PPE contracts after a Guardian investigation. She denies defrauding the Department for Health and Social Care, but the Labour leader has called the situation a “shocking disgrace”. Under plans being drawn up by Starmer’s policy officials, Labour would introduce stiffer punishments for those who commit fraud against the government. The law allows for jail terms of up to 10 years for the most serious fraud cases. Benefits and tax fraud are considered worse offences, but judges are not allowed to hand down tougher punishments if a criminal has fraudulently claimed money from the government in other ways, for example by bidding wrongly for public contracts. Figures released by the government last year show banks had flagged nearly £1.7bn worth of Covid loans as potentially fraudulent by the end of June, mostly from Rishi Sunak’s £47bn bounce back loan scheme. The National Audit Office estimated last March that the government had been defrauded of £5.5bn in 2018-19 and 2019-20, which then jumped to £21bn in 2020-21 and 2021-22. Campaigners say that tougher sentences for those who commit fraud against taxpayers would help tackle the problem, and bring the UK into line with countries such as the US, Canada and Australia. Labour is considering either bringing in a separate offence of fraud against the public purse or making it an exacerbating factor in sentencing guidelines, sources said. George Havenhand, a senior legal researcher at Spotlight on Corruption, said: “The UK is out of step with its key allies, like the US and Canada, in having no specific offence of fraud against the government, other than in relation to welfare and tax, despite the fact that it costs the UK billions of pounds each year. “If a targeted offence had been in place during the pandemic, the deterrent effect would have better protected the public purse from the vast losses to Covid loan fraud, the fraudsters who tried it on would be looking at tougher sentences and we could be seeing more taxpayers’ money recovered.” However Starmer is also considering rowing back on another part of his plan to clean up government, which would have seen former ministers barred from lobbying for companies over which they once had oversight for five years after leaving office. The proposals were announced last summer by Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, and formed an important part of proposals to clean up politics made by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 2021. They came after the Greensill scandal, in which the former prime minister David Cameron lobbied ministers on behalf of a bank for which he worked and which subsequently collapsed. At the time, Rayner said: “Labour will stop the revolving door between government and the companies that ministers are supposed to regulate, banning ministers from lobbying for at least five years after they leave office, and with proper enforcement against those who break the rules.” The government has rejected the idea of a five-year moratorium, saying that it would be an unfair restraint on former ministers. Now Labour sources say they also believe it could be excessive, though they are still deciding the exact policy as officials hurry to finalise the party’s manifesto by the end of the month. Any decision to row back on the plan is likely to disappoint transparency campaigners, who have long called for stricter lobbying rules. Havenhand said: “It should be possible to impose lobbying bans of at least five years in certain circumstances, including for former senior ministers, as a series of scandals in recent years has vividly illustrated.”"

        "content": "The “revolving door” that allows ministers and top officials to take up lucrative roles after leaving government has been feature of public life for decades. In a speech on Thursday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will promise to “restore standards in public life with a total crackdown on cronyism”, although plans to make it more difficult for former ministers who move to the private sector appear to have been scaled back. Here are some of the more notable examples of the revolving door: Boris Johnson The former prime minister is a double flouter of rules designed to regulate post-government appointments. Former ministers are supposed to seek the advice of the notoriously toothless Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) before taking up new roles. Johnson committed a “clear breach” of these rules when he told Acoba that he was becoming a Daily Mail columnist last June, only 30 minutes before his job was publicly announced. He had previously taken up a lucrative column as a Daily Telegraph columnist in 2018 without informing Acoba, just weeks after he resigned as foreign secretary. Keir Starmer When the Labour leader stepped down from his previous role as director of public prosecutions in 2013, he failed to consult Acoba before taking up consultancy at the elite law firm Mishcon de Reya in June 2014. As a former senior civil servant, Starmer was required to consult Acoba about any roles he wanted to take up within two years of his departure. His brief consultancy role at the firm was worth at least £100,000. George Osborne A committee of MPs accused the former chancellor of showing “disrespect” for the rules when he accepted the editorship of the Evening Standard in March 2017 without clearing it with Acoba. Osborne took up at least 10 private sector jobs within five years of leaving office. They included a £650,000-a-year role with BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager. George Eustice After nine years as environment minister, including nearly two as secretary of state, Eustice set up a company to advise businesses on farming technology and the water sector. He has been told by Acoba that it must be informed every time his firm takes on a new client. It warned of the risk that his clients could gain from government insights and be afforded unfair access. Philip Hammond The former chancellor accused Acoba of trying to demonstrate it was not “toothless” when it criticised him for approaching a senior Treasury official on behalf of OakNorth bank. Acoba’s chairman, Eric Pickles, had told Hammond: “I do not consider it was in keeping with the letter or the spirit of the government’s rules for the former chancellor to contact HMT on behalf of a bank which pays for his advice.” Other occasions where former Conservative cabinet ministers failed to consult Acoba over new roles include: the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries when she became a TalkTV host; the former home secretary Priti Patel when she accepted a role with the advisory firm Viasat; and the former health secretary Matt Hancock when he was paid to appear on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Patricia Hewitt Hewitt took a consultancy with Alliance Boots seven months after leaving her role as Labour health secretary in 2007. She also took a £55,000 role with Cinven, which bought 25 private hospitals from Bupa. Other politicians from the New Labour era who subsequently took paid roles in fields closely related to their government work include: David Blunkett, Alan Milburn, John Hutton and John Reid."

        "content": "New year, new you! That period of grace and self-realisation when you can become a better version of yourself. The person you would ideally like to be. Free from the defects and life choices that were dragging you down. At least, that’s how it used to be. Only this year the rules have changed. The only transformation now on offer is the one the government allows for you. The act of becoming has become an act of unbecoming. We have now entered a new era. One that is predicated on the government’s own perfections. Its ministers incapable of error. The fault lies entirely in the rest of us. Those who have not yet appreciated the full glory of the Sunakered. We lesser mortals whose vision has been dimmed by our own internal darkened universe. For there is only one true reality. And that is whatever the government wants it to be. Rishi Sunak is the sole arbiter of the truth. He alone is blessed with the knowledge of the divine. Received wisdoms of time and space have been dissolved. Sidelined into an alternate reality. All that is real is what Rish! says is real. Black can be white, up can be down. Depending on the prime minister’s mood. The one change required of all of us is to be open to this new state of consciousness. This was James Cleverly’s message to Mishal Husain for his first appearance on the Today programme for 2024. A message of hope for a country that had for the last 14 years allowed itself to get bogged down in the trivia of a cost of living crisis, declining public services and countless tax increases. Now there would be no more broken promises because the past was a foreign country where these promises had never been made. We would be living in a rose-tinted permanent present configured to Sunak’s own command. It is Cleverly’s blessing that he is the most able of Rishi Sunak’s cabinet lieutenants. The man who can be trusted to go down all guns blazing during any media appearance. Who can be relied on to do what he’s told. Even if he’s told to make a complete idiot of himself. He is what every prime minister badly needs. The ideal 11th in command. It is Cleverly’s curse that he also happens to be not very bright. At times actively thick. Jimmy Dimly is one of life’s strivers. It’s what has made him so at home in the Conservative party. He doesn’t just accept his lack of ability. He works hard to be the stupidest version of himself possible. It’s why he’s so popular among his colleagues. He’s no competition. But it does mean his limitations are constantly exposed. Tuesday was no exception. Though whether the home secretary actually notices is another matter. He sometimes hovers on the brink of cognition. Husain cut to the chase. Sunak was claiming he had cleared the backlog of small boats arrivals. And regardless of whether these were legacy cases or people who had come to the UK since June 2022, this was untrue. So why had the prime minister chosen to begin the election year with yet another lie? I mean, if he was going to distort the truth couldn’t he at least credit us with some intelligence and come up with a lie that wasn’t going to fall apart in five seconds? Don’t worry your pretty little head, said Dimly, not being at all patronising and condescending. It was a new year with new rules, so he would try to explain it to her in words of one syllable. It was like this: the prime minister had said he had cleared the backlog. And if he said he had done something then he must have done it. Otherwise he wouldn’t have said it. Get it? Dimly smirked at his own faultless logic. This was going really well. People would talk about his time at the Home Office for decades to come. Yes, but not in a good way. “In any case,” yawned Jimmy D. “Sunak had only committed to processing all the backlog claims.” He hadn’t, of course. This would have been another lie were we not in a new universe of the truth being anything Rish! said it was. Try to keep up, Mishal. Get with the programme. So it didn’t really matter where the thousands of people who had gone missing had got to as they had officially been processed. Husain tried to get a steer on when the rest of the refugee arrivals might have their claims processed. Dimly openly laughed. That was the wrong question to ask. She hadn’t understood the maths. That was retrospective maths. He was only interested in the present or future maths. They were a completely different type of maths to conventional maths. A branch of algebra where addition and subtraction became meaningless. Weirdly, he managed to say all this without realising how much of an idiot he was making of himself. A kind of genius. Moving on. How come he had called Stockton a shit-hole? “I didn’t,” Jimmy D insisted. “I merely called another MP a shit.” Er … OK, said Husain. If you say so. But everyone else heard you say shit-hole. “That’s not true. They can’t have, because I definitely didn’t say it,” snapped Cleverly, approaching Sunak levels of tetchiness. People could only have heard what he wanted them to have heard. His fantasy was the only true reality. “That’s not how science works,” Dimly concluded as Husain dared to voice the truth. Bless. One of the stupidest men in parliament was now giving a lecture on the laws of physics on the BBC. Another collector’s item. Last, on to the date rape gag. “I apologised immediately after I was found out,” said Cleverly. And the fact that he had made the joke showed how much he cared about the issue. Apparently. Imagine the fuss if a Labour MP had said it. Or a serving police officer. One of the people of whom he was nominally in charge. Husain chose to wind things up. Job done. People do seem to have the unfortunate habit of misinterpreting things you say rather often, she observed, before cutting him off. We were only two days into 2024 and she had already struck interview gold. Yet another morning for Jimmy D to forget.  John Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

        "content": "\n 5.10pm GMT \nAfternoon summary\n\n\nAlmost 100,000 people seeking asylum in the UK are waiting for a decision amid growing claims that ministers have massaged official figures to try to show that they have cut the backlog of cases. The Home Office claims that, with an exception made for difficult cases, it has got rid of the backlog for “legacy” asylum applications – defined as those in the system before June 2022 (when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force). See 9.19am. But Rishi Sunak posted a message on X implying the whole backlog was cleared by the end of 2023. Labour said this was a “barefaced lie”. (See 1.37pm.) The official figures show that, although the total backlog is now lower than it was when Sunak became PM, it is still more than double what it was at the time of the last election. (See 3.10pm.)\n\n\nJames Cleverly, the home secretary, has conceded that a pre-Christmas “joke” he made about spiking his wife’s drink with a “date rape” drug could have distracted from his department’s work to tackle violence against women and girls.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.25pm GMT\n\n\n 4.23pm GMT \n\nSeveral readers have asked why Nigel Farage was quoted earlier in the blog.\nSome people argued that he should be ignored because his views are objectionable. Doubtless a lot of Guardian readers feel the same way, but if reporting is meant to be describing the world as it is, then you can’t just ignore the people and the views you don’t like.\nThe main objection, though, was that Farage’s views did not merit reporting because he’s not a significant political figure. As one person put it, he’s “now just a reality TV contestant”.\nBut he’s not. Rather, he is a reality TV contestant, but he’s not just a reality TV contestant. He is almost certainly the most influential, and talented, far-right populist politician in the UK. He did not deliver Brexit singlehandedly, but he did as much as anyone to make it happen, making him one of the most consequential British politicians of the postwar era. \nHe did all that without being an MP, and quite a lot of the time he wasn’t even Ukip leader either (because he kept resigning). He has got a clear interest in mobilising populist opinion, he has a big following with the public, he is the dominant figure in one political party (Reform UK), and is very popular with members of another (Tories – 70% of members favour letting him rejoin). In the next Conservative party leadership contest any candidate wanting to win is going to say they would allow Farage to be readmitted and it is possible to imagine him back in, and even party leader, before the election after the one due this year. He probably has more chance of leading the Tories into the 2028 general election campaign than Suella Braverman. So I don’t think it’s realistic to argue that his views don’t count; if Brexit is any guide, then people should have been taking him more seriously in the pre-2016 years, not less.\nAnd one reader queried my assertion that he in effect controls Reform UK. When I wrote that, I included a link to this Unherd article by Tom McTague that backs this up. (Links are always included in the blog for a reason – do click on them if you are ever unsure why I am saying something.) McTague’s article is well worth reading in full but here is the relevant passsage.\n\nReform UK is no ordinary political party. In many ways, it is less a political party than a company, with shareholders and an ever-growing number of customers. Tice may be the leader of the party, but he is ultimately answerable to those shareholders – and the majority are owned by, you guessed it, Farage himself. Originally, the idea behind this set-up was simple. At Ukip, Farage had grown increasingly tired of the party’s internal bureaucratic struggles. When he set up the Brexit party in March 2019, he was determined to avoid a repetition of this, and so created a company he could control, rather than a party he had to manage. This allowed Farage to focus all his efforts on the campaign for Brexit …\nWhile the exact details of who owns what percentages of Reform UK remain veiled in secrecy, according to one inside figure who knows the breakdown it is simple enough. In total there are 15 shares, of which Farage owns eight, Tice five, Oakden one and the party secretary, Mehrtash a’Zami, one. According to Companies House, this makes Farage – officially – a person with “significant control” over the company, which they define as having “the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors”.\n\nMcTague says Farage’s colleagues in Reform UK aren’t sure whether or not Farage would rejoin the Tories. McTague says Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, wants Labour to win the election because he thinks it will introduce electoral reform, making it possible for a small party such as Reform UK to win seats in parliament. Given Keir Starmer’s record on PR, the chances of that seem remote – which is another reason why Farage may one day conclude that the Conservative party would offer him a more useful political platform.\n\nUpdated at 4.46pm GMT\n\n\n 3.25pm GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nOn Radio 4 Today this morning Cleverly claimed illegal entrant returns were substantially up – I think he said by 2/3. But he gave no absolute numbers. It is significant if an extra 10,000 were returned! An extra 10, less so. Do we have any numbers on this?\n\nThe figures are in this Home Office dataset. It shows that, in the year ending September 2023, there were 3,875 enforced returns. That is an increase of more than 50% on the previous year, but still quite a low figure by comparison with what was happening in the years before 2020. Voluntary returns numbered 10,896 in the year ending September 2023. Again, this was up on the previous year, by 74%, but well below the pre-2020 norm.\n\nUpdated at 4.48pm GMT\n\n\n 3.10pm GMT \nAlmost 100,000 people waiting for asylum application decision, figures show\n\nAlmost 100,000 people seeking asylum in the UK are waiting for a decision, Rajeev Syal reports. The figures come from a table in this dataset published by the Home Office today alongside the figures purporting to show that it has cleared the “legacy” backlog of asylum claims. As Rajeev reports, of the current 98,599 backlog, 34% (33,085) are eligible to be sent to Rwanda because they applied after the Illegal Migration Act became law, the figures suggest.\nHere is the table.\nAnd here is Rajeev’s story.\n\n Related: Cleverly says UK asylum backlog cleared as almost 100,000 wait for decision \n\n\n\n\n 1.57pm GMT \n\nThe first UK maritime shipment of aid for Gaza has arrived in Egypt, carrying almost 90 tonnes of thermal blankets and other essential items, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe shipment was delivered from Cyprus by Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Lyme Bay, carrying thermal blankets, shelter packs and medical supplies provided by the UK and the Republic of Cyprus.\nFrom Port Said, the aid will be received by the Egyptian Red Crescent and will make its way to Arish and then through Rafah and into Gaza for distribution by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.\nThe UK will continue to explore other routes for aid deliveries, including the Cypriot initiative for a maritime corridor between Cyprus and Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories and supporting United Nations World Food Programme through the humanitarian land corridor from Jordan through Kerem Shalom, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in its news release.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.04pm GMT\n\n\n 1.49pm GMT \nSNP became too reliant on Nicola Sturgeon, says Mhairi Black, its deputy leader at Westminster\n\nThe SNP became too reliant on Nicola Sturgeon, its deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black, has said.\nIn an interview with Times Radio, Black said that although the former first minister was a huge asset to her party, she was “uncomfortable” with how dominant Sturgeon became.\nAsked if the “cult of personality” around Sturgeon had been a challenge for the SNP, Black replied:\n\nFor me, personally, yes. It always made me quite uncomfortable.\nBut as I say, I do think she’s one of the best, if not the best-performing politicians that I’ve seen. I’ve rarely seen anybody get the better of Nicola Sturgeon.\nSo, in that sense, of course, she’s a massive asset to have.\nBut I remember I did always feel a wee bit uncomfortable, we shouldn’t be relying on one face or one person.\nIt should be about the movement and about the vision of what we want to see change and what we want to happen.\nThere’s a balance to be struck and I’m not convinced that we always got the balance right …\nI’ve always had my issues with how [the party] is run or how decisions have been arrived at.\n\nSturgeon resigned last year after more than eight years as first minister. Black said she thought that was “actually quite healthy” for the SNP. She explained:\n\nI’m a big believer in politics should be about policy as opposed to personality.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.58pm GMT\n\n\n 1.37pm GMT \nSunak's claim to have cleared the asylum decisions backlog a 'barefaced lie', says Labour\n\nStephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, has described Rishi Sunak’s post on X saying he has cleared the backlog of asylum applications as a “barefaced lie”. (See 12.34pm.)\n\nThe PM’s barefaced lie that he has cleared the asylum backlog would be laughable if it wasn’t such an insult to the public’s intelligence.Statistics published this morning by his own Govt show there are still around 100,000 cases languishing in the Tories’ never-ending backlog.\n\n\n\nThe PM's barefaced lie that he has cleared the asylum backlog would be laughable if it wasn't such an insult to the public's intelligence. Statistics pulished this morning by his own Govt show there are still around 100,000 cases languishing in the Tories' never-ending backlog. https://t.co/9CrXv77Qj4— Stephen Kinnock (@SKinnock) January 2, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 5.12pm GMT\n\n\n 1.23pm GMT \nReduction in small boat crossings in 2023 not related to poor weather, No 10 says\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson also insisted that the reduction in small boat crossings in 2023 was not related to poor weather conditions. The spokesperson said:\n\nAs ever with small boats, we are always alive to seasonal effects.\nBut I think given the substantive and sustained decline, it is wrong to claim that this big reduction, this 36% reduction, is down to poor weather.\nIn fact, that assertion is not backed up by the facts. The number of good sailing days this year was only four fewer than the previous year.\nThere were 106 ‘red days’ in 2022, 102 in 2023. And we are bucking the trend of what we are seeing in Europe, where crossings are up significantly.”\n\nSo-called “red days” are days when the weather is deemed favourable for small boat crossings. They are red days for Border Force officials who have to deal with the arrivals.\n\n\n\n 1.06pm GMT \nNo 10 refuses to follow Cleverly in setting end of 2024 as target date for ending all small boat crossings\n\nJames Cleverly, the home secretary, told LBC this morning that his aim was to reduce the number of people crossing the Channel on small boats to “zero” in 2024. Asked what his target for the year was, he replied:\n\nMy target is to bring it down to zero.\n\nWhen the presenter, Nick Ferrari, asked him to confirm that he meant zero by the end of 2024, Cleverly replied:\n\nThat’s my target. My target is to reduce it to zero, to stop the boats. And I’m unambiguous about that.\nAnd the point is, actually last year, the final figures last year, it was 36% reduction year on year. In the last half of last year, compared with the last half of the year before that, it was down by 45%. And the last quarter of last year, compared to the last quarter of the year before that, it was down by over 60%. So the trend is heading in the right direction.\n\nBut at the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the prime minister’s spokesperson refused to endorse the end of the year as a target date for the elimination of small boat crossings. “I’m not setting a specific deadline beyond wanting to pass that legislation so we can get flights off the ground to provide the deterrent effect that is necessary,” he said.\nAlthough Downing Street has adopted “stop the boats” as a target and a slogan, it has never said when this might happen. Rishi Sunak has suggested he does not expect this to happen before the election.\nThis is another example of how promises can be counterproductive. (See 12.30pm.) If Sunak had simply pledged last year to reduce small boat crossings, his article for the Express today would have been about how that was a promise kept. But, of course, he could not have said that last year because he would have been criticised by Tory MPs and rightwing papers for lack of ambition.\n\nUpdated at 1.16pm GMT\n\n\n 12.39pm GMT \n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson claimed the government had “gone further” than promised in tackling the asylum application backlog. In response to comments from Labour and others saying the legacy backlog has not been fully cleared, the spokesperson said:\n\nWe committed to clearing the backlog. That is what the government has done.\nWe are being very transparent about what that entails.\nWe have processed all of those cases and indeed gone further than the original commitment. We’re up to 112,000 decisions made overall.\nAs a result of that process, there are a small minority of cases which are complex and which, because of our rigorous standards, require further work. But nonetheless, it is a significant piece of work by Home Office officials to process such huge numbers in a short period of time while retaining our rigorous safety standard.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.55pm GMT\n\n\n 12.34pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak is even being factchecked on small boats by Elon Musk (or at least by X, which is owned by Musk). This morning Sunak said in a post:\n\nI said that this government would clear the backlog of asylum decisions by the end of 2023.That’s exactly what we’ve done.\n\n\n\nI said that this government would clear the backlog of asylum decisions by the end of 2023. That’s exactly what we’ve done. Over 112,000 cases are now cleared with a lower grant rate than last year, a key part of our plan to stop the boats.— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) January 2, 2024\n\n\nX has included “added context” saying:\n\nThe backlog has not been cleared.\n\nUPDATE: The reference to Sunak being fact-checked by Musk was just frivolous levity (or attempted levity). Various readers have been in touch to point out that the added context function is just a feature of the site launched before he took it over. This is from one of them.\n\nIt’s not quite right to say that Twitter has “added context” to Sunak’s tweet about boat crossings, and it’s misleading to imply that Twitter or Musk has had some role in “factchecking” it. The feature being used is Community Notes, where ordinary Twitter users submit and vote on context to add below tweets. This feature was introduced (before Musk’s tenure) in an effort to combat misinformation, and it is also frequently used to criticise Musk himself.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.12pm GMT\n\n\n 12.30pm GMT \nHas Sunak really broken five 'promises' made in relation to tackling small boats?\n\nPoliticians like making firm pledges. For a party in government, a promise can have a galvanising effect on the civil service machinery, focusing attention on outcomes and ensuring stuff happens. For voters, it’s a signal that a leader shares their concerns (assuming it’s the right pledge). And when politicians keep their promises, they build up trust.\nBut promises are also perilous because, if they get broken, policy failure becomes even more conspicuous. That is why politicians are generally quite cautious about making cast-iron commitments and why their pledges are normally heavily qualified.\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says Rishi Sunak has broken five promises on small boats. (See 11.07am.) By my count, she can only get to five by misrepresenting some pledges, or by treating policy aspirations as policy commitments. But, from a communications perspective, that does not really matter, because her thread on X this morning has successfully highlighted areas where Sunak’s performance on small boats has not lived up to expectations.\nFor pedants and purists, here is an analysis of whether firm promises have been broken in these areas.\nAsylum backlog: Clearing the “legacy” asylum backlog was treated by the media and the government as a firm pledge, but when Sunak announced this in the Commons in December 2022 he said: “We expect to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by the end of next year.” That “expect” was an attempt to leave wiggle room. Sunak clearly thinks his record, a massive increase in the rate at which claims are being processed (see 10.30am), is something to be proud of, but Cooper is right to point out that, because of the exemptions, the backlog has not been fully cleared.\nAsylum hotel use: Sunak told MPs in December 2022 he wanted to end hotel use for asylum seekers, but he did not say when it would happen. He told the Commons:\n\nWe are spending £5.5m every day on using hotels to house asylum seekers. We must end this.\n\nAs Cooper points out, this is not happening.\nStopping the boats: Cooper says Sunak committed to stopping the boats in 2023 but, although this was one of his pledges for 2023, at the press conference where he unveiled them, he made it clear that he was not saying this would actually happen in 2023. In fact, he refused to say what the pledge actually meant; it would be for the public to judge, he said.\nAll arrivals to be returned: This is another topic where Sunak expressed a desire for something to happen without being specific about when. He told MPs in December 2022:\n\nWe will introduce new legislation to make it unambiguously clear that, if you enter the UK illegally, you should not be able to remain here. Instead, you will be detained and swiftly returned either to your home country or to a safe country where your asylum claim will be considered.\n\nAs Cooper points out, Sunak is nowhere near achieving this.\nSmall boats law: The firmest pledge from Sunak on small boats came when he delivered his five pledges this time last year, saying:\n\nWe will pass new laws to stop small boats, making sure that if you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed.\n\nIf the pledge was “pass new laws”, he kept that, because the Illegal Migration Act became law. But, as Cooper points out, the Home Office has not implemented the key provisions, because they are reliant on the Rwanda deportation policy being lawful, which currently it’s not. But if you take the pledge as extending to the rest of the sentence, “making sure [etc]” – which is how a reasonable person would understand it – then it hasn’t been met.\n\nUpdated at 1.04pm GMT\n\n\n 11.55am GMT \nNigel Farage says Tories have 'failed' on small boats because 50,000 people have been granted asylum\n\nIf Rishi Sunak thought all anti-immigration rightwingers would welcome the announcement about the asylum application backlog this morning, he will be disappointed.

It is described as an “ad hoc statistical release”, which means it is not being published as part of the routine data reporting schedule. The Home Office says it has been released to support “the prime minister’s statement of 2 January 2024” – a reference to an article he has written for the Daily Express.\n\nThe number of initial asylum application decisions taken last year was more than three times as high as the figure for the previous year, the Home Office says. That is partly because there has been a big increase in the number of staff employed to deal with these cases. The Home Office says:\n\n\nLocal provisional MI [management information data] shows that, in the four weeks from 20 November to 17 December 2023 there were 20,481 initial asylum decisions made. This number of decisions compares to a total of 20,039 decisions made in the whole of 2021.\nThere were more than 112,138 initial asylum decisions made on asylum cases between 1 January and 28 December 2023. In the year 1 January to 31 December 2022 there were 31,766 initial decisions.\n\n\nBut the number of applications considered dealt with because they have been withdrawn or considered not valid has also increased hugely, the Home Office says. Withdrawn applications are almost three times as high as they were in 2022. The Home Office says:\n\n\nOf the 112,138 initial asylum decisions made between January and 28 December 2023, 35,119 were non-substantive decisions. In the year 1 January to 31 December 2022 there were 13,093 non-substantive decisions. Non-substantive decisions include withdrawn applications and administrative decisions (void and deceased).\n\nRajeev Syal, the Guardian’s home affairs editor, tells me:\n\nA claim is seen as withdrawn if an applicant fails to maintain contact with the Home Office, fails to complete an asylum questionnaire properly, or fails to attend a personal interview. When changes were made to the the definition of withdrawn claims over the summer, an unnamed Home Office source told the Guardian: “This is done to basically bring the backlog down. A lot of interviews were booked to withdraw as many claims as possible (if people didn’t turn up).”\n\n\nSome 602 small boats were detected crossing the Channel in 2023, compared with 1,110 in 2022, the Home Office says. That implies crossings have almost halved. But people smugglers are using larger boats than in the past, and the number of individuals crossing the Channel on small boats last year was down by 36%.\n\n\nThe number of operations to stop small boat crossings increased last year, the Home Office says. It says:\n\n\nBased upon information provided by French authorities, the number of small boats prevented from crossing the Channel by the French have increased over the last year.\nThe Home Office undertook 707 Organised Crime Group disruption activities between 1 October 2022 and 30 November 2023, compared to 554 between 1 October 2021 and 30 November 2022. These numbers will not include additional work aimed at organised crime groups by the National Crime Agency (NCA).\n\n\nThe number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers fell from 398 at the end of October 2023 to 348 on 17 December, the Home Office says.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.20pm GMT\n\n\n 9.49am GMT \n67% of asylum applications subject to initial decision in 2023 were granted, says Home Office\n\nThe Home Office has just published the data used to justify its overnight claim about having cleared the “legacy” asylum applications backlog. The report is here.\n\nIt says that, of the 112,138 application subject to an initial decision in 2023, 67% were granted.\n\nThis refutes the suggestion repeatedly made by Suella Braverman when she was home secretary (for example, here) that most people crossing the Channel on small boats are not genuine asylum seekers.\nThe Home Office paper says:\n\nOf the 112,138 initial asylum decisions, 77,019 were substantive decisions (51,469 grants and 25,550 refusals, which is a grant rate of 67%). This represents the highest annual number of substantive decisions on asylum cases made since 2002. 86,800 of these decisions were made on Legacy applications, with a further 25,338 decisions on Flow applications.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.53am GMT\n\n\n 9.32am GMT \nCleverly says spiking joke ‘clearly caused hurt’\n\nIn his interviews this morning James Cleverly, the home secretary, admitted that that a pre-Christmas “joke” he made about spiking his wife’s drink with a date rape drug could have distracted from his department’s work to tackle violence against women and girls. Ben Quinn has the full story here.\n\n Related: James Cleverly says spiking joke ‘clearly caused hurt’ \n\n\n\n\n 9.19am GMT \nJames Cleverly rejects claims Home Office wrong to say it has cleared legacy asylum claims backlog\n\nGood morning and happy new year. Politics is not starting at full pelt this week – the Commons is not back until next week, and although Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have visits scheduled for later this week, we’re not expecting to hear from them today – but James Cleverly, the home secretary, has been doing a media round, and the news is dominated by an argument about immigration policy. As it will be, no doubt, for most of the rest of 2024. Never mind; only 365 more days to go.\nCleverly is doing interviews because the Home Office says it has found a pledge by Rishi Sunak that he has actually met: clearing the backlog for “legacy” asylum applications. As Rajeev Syal explains in his overnight story, experts say this is misleading, and that in fact the backlog has not been fully cleared.\n\n Related: Thousands of ‘legacy’ asylum cases awaiting decisions despite Sunak’s pledge \n\nLabour is also questioning the Home Office’s claim. This is what Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said last night.\n\nThe asylum backlog has rocketed to 165,000 under the Tories – eight times higher than when Labour left office – and no slicing or renaming the figures can disguise that fact. Even their claims to have cleared the so-called ‘legacy backlog’ are false.\nOver 4,000 claims are unresolved and a disturbing 17,000 asylum seekers have simply been ‘withdrawn’ by the Tories from this legacy backlog, with ministers seeming to have no idea where they are and whether they are reapplying or disappearing into the underground economy.\n\nBut on the Today programme, when Mishal Husain asked him why the Home Office was saying the legacy backlog target had been met when it hadn’t, Cleverly replied:\n\nBecause it has. Because it has. Our commitment was to make sure we process those 92,000 legacy claims, predating 28 June 2022. They had not been assessed. Those people needed to be accommodated, they needed to be supported financially, and the prime minister committed to processing all those applications. Every single one of those applications has been processed.\n\nIn fact, when Sunak made the commitment in the Commons in December 2022, he talked not just about processing claims, but about eliminating the backlog. “We expect to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by the end of next year,” he told MPs.\nCleverly has also faced questions for the first time about the controversy generated by the date rape joke he made in private at a Christmas drinks reception in Downing Street. Asked about the comment, which led to calls for his resignation, Cleverly told Sky News that his apology was “heartfelt” and that his actions as a minister showed he took violence against women and girls very seriously. He told the programme:\n\nIt was a joke that I made and of course you know I regret it and I apologised immediately, and that apology is heartfelt.\nBut the point that I’ve made is that as home secretary I was the first home secretary to put forward legislation to toughen our ability to deal with spiking.\nMy first visit as home secretary was to an investigation team investigating violence against women and girls, when I was foreign secretary I set a target that 80% of our aid has got to demonstrably have a positive effect for women and girls. I shouldn’t have said it and I apologised immediately …\nI’m sorry because it clearly caused hurt, it’s potentially distracted from the work we were doing to tackle spiking to help predominantly women who are the victims of spiking and I regret that. But I’m absolutely determined to continue the work that I’ve been doing for years.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nI will post more from his interviews shortly.\nThere is not much on the agenda today, but at 9.30am the Home Office is publishing more figures relating to the asylum claims backlog and at 11.30am we have got a No 10 lobby briefing.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a laptop or a desktop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.\n\nUpdated at 11.12am GMT\n"

        "content": "The UK home secretary, James Cleverly, has conceded that a pre-Christmas “joke” he made about spiking his wife’s drink with a “date rape” drug could have distracted from his department’s work to tackle violence against women and girls.\nIn his first public appearances since comments made at a Downing Street reception prompted calls for his resignation, Cleverly reiterated an apology for what he described as a joke and sought to emphasise his record in government on bringing forward policies to help women and girls.\nHe has been facing calls by campaigners and others to resign after the comment at a Downing Street reception just hours after the Home Office announced plans to crack down on spiking – putting drugs into another person’s drink or directly into their body without their knowledge.\nHe told Sky News: “I’m sorry because it clearly caused hurt, it’s potentially distracted from the work we were doing to tackle spiking to help predominantly women who are the victims of spiking and I regret that. But I’m absolutely determined to continue the work that I’ve been doing for years.”\nCampaigners said his comments were likely to be “upsetting and triggering” to victims of spiking and sexual assault, and called for an overhaul of attitudes that normalised “banter” about date rape and coercive control.\nCleverly told guests at a Downing Street reception that “a little bit of Rohypnol in her drink every night” was “not really illegal if it’s only a little bit”, the Sunday Mirror reported.\nHe also laughed that the secret to a long marriage was making sure your spouse was “someone who is always mildly sedated so she can never realise there are better men out there”.\n\n Related: Champagne worth £90,000 bought in House of Lords last year, FoI data shows \n\nConversations at Downing Street receptions are usually understood to be off the record but the Sunday Mirror said it broke the convention because of Cleverly’s position and the subject.\nCleverly said on Tuesday morning: “I made a joke. It was an awful joke, but I apologised immediately and I am absolutely committed and I have been throughout my political career, to the protection of women and girls”\nJemima Olchawski, the chief executive of the leading women’s rights charity the Fawcett Society, said Cleverly clearly needed to take the issue of women’s safety more seriously.\n“It’s right that he has apologised instead of continuing to double down and claim his misogynistic comments were a joke. The home secretary now needs to walk the talk and show us exactly what his commitment to better protecting women looks like. Words matter – particularly when it comes to those who hold so much power in our society.”\nPolice receive an average of 561 reports of spiking a month, with the majority being made by women, typically after incidents in or near bars and nightclubs, according to a Home Office report.\nThe comments are the latest attributed to Cleverly in circumstances that have landed him in hot water. A Labour MP accused him last year of describing the constituency of Stockton North as a “shit-hole” in parliament.\nCleverly bristled when he was asked about this again on Tuesday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, insisting he had not used the word “shit-hole”, but instead had used the word “shit” to refer to an individual."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-02T07:00:55+00:00",
        "content": "Not all of the green belt should be “preserved in aspic for ever”, the government’s building design tsar has said, as he warned that with all but the highest earning young people priced out of buying, “desperation … to get more homes built is just going up”. Nicholas Boys Smith, a former Tory adviser appointed by Michael Gove to run the Office for Place, which will advise on planning for new communities, said not all of the green belt “of low or no agricultural or amenity quality” should be protected for ever. Building on the green belt is a politically sensitive topic and has previously sparked Conservative backbench rebellions against planning reforms where MPs fear losing seats if green space is threatened. On 19 December, Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, responded by announcing councils would no longer have to redraw green belt boundaries to satisfy housing targets as long as they could justify “departure from assessed housing need”. Boys Smith is not advocating for mass development on the anti-sprawl buffers but said: “We have not built enough over the last five, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. As a society we have fallen out of love with the future and we have … under both political parties failed to build enough homes. “Clearly we need to look at the quality of land within green belts and need to think which of this should be preserved.”  In the 1990s Boys Smith was an adviser on welfare policy to the Conservative social security secretary, Peter Lilley, and in 2006 he advised George Osborne, then shadow chancellor, on tax. He has been a McKinsey consultant and an investment banker and set up the urbanism thinktank Create Streets in 2012.   The average Guardian reader and the average Telegraph reader is actually going to agree on much of this   His critique of decades of planning failure is that too much of what has been built is unloved by the public and that attempts to slash planning red tape have slowed development by increasing uncertainty about what can and cannot be built. Community-led design codes would provide a clear template for what is acceptable and ensure the public is happier with what is built, he believes. He said that when running consultations at community events and online, with pictures of potential streets and houses, “you get a pretty strong 70 to 90% majority on most types of things”. This kind of planning consultation to create design codes was previously championed by King Charles when he was the Prince of Wales, through his Prince’s Foundation for the Built Environment. Boys Smith is an ally of the king’s view that traditional urbanism provides the best template for new homes. He wants to see more streets and squares lined by traditional housing and mansion blocks using limited palettes of materials and patterns. He appears to have persuaded the Labour leadership too. Keir Starmer announced in October that a Labour government would build new towns, based on new design standards to speed construction. Journalists were briefed that Labour was keen to see “Georgian-style” townhouses. The Office for Place was launched in July by Gove and has been tasked with helping draw up design codes for different areas that could speed up the planning process for millions of new homes by providing a fast track if builders stay in line with the codes. Boys Smith said he opposes more volume housebuilding that involves “chucking a cul-de-sac in a field” and wants codes drafted with community and council involvement so the public can “require what they find beautiful and refuse what they find ugly”. Twenty-five towns and cities have developed codes including one for 900 homes in Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. Over the county border, in Buckinghamshire, the Conservatives lost a byelection in Chesham and Amersham in 2021 amid criticism that they were encouraging too much housebuilding. Boys Smith believes the codes should accelerate housebuilding by allowing developers to avoid the current planning consents and get building faster and with less risk. While 178,000 new homes were built in England last year, the most since 1989, this was well below the more than 300,000 widely accepted as needed annually. Boys Smith also said that “in the north we need to fall back in love with lots of town centres that have been hollowed out over the last 60 or 70 years”. He named the towns of Grimsby, Halifax and Rochdale, and the city of Sunderland, as places where policymakers should seek to encourage “more people to want to live in, work in, set up businesses in, bring their families up there”. “People have remarkably strong sense of place, even if they don’t quite realise they do,” he said. “If you show them pictures of how you think houses should look, unerringly a really strong majority plug for the thing that feels and looks local.” The approach presents a challenge to the major volume housebuilders and Boys Smith admitted: “My heart very often sinks when I see new development.” He added: “It will become harder to build the same house in Cumbria as in Cornwall, so that might be a disadvantage to housebuilders. “The house you build in Yorkshire does need to feel like it’s in Yorkshire. That may create more cost. I would argue it’s creating more value as well.” People like to see “variety in pattern and texture, material that feels local, decent ratio between the height of the street and the width of the street”, he said. It produces “a tighter version volume housing with more sense of place”. “I remember a very moving conversation with a lady of West Indian background in Tottenham when she said: ‘I want a place with a heart,’” he said. “You can get a colonel in Hampshire who basically says the same thing.” In response, the Home Builders Federation said: “Builders are keen to work with local authorities to create schemes that respect local vernacular, whilst being mindful of the need to ensure they are viable to deliver.” Boys Smith denied that his approach may have a better chance of success because it aligns with principles of urbanism that have long been espoused by the king. But he said: “I think what the king or the Prince of Wales said on placemaking was right and can be shown to be right and that that is actually now widely accepted … the average Guardian reader and the average Telegraph reader is actually going to agree on much of this.” Nicholas Boys Smith’s favourite places … and a couple he really doesn’t like Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Wiltshire – “It’s in the old [1973] Hovis advertisement by Ridley Scott of a boy pushing a bike. It’s so outrageously unbuildable now. “When you poll people on their favourite streets, it’s often a curve on a hill. You get the sinuousness of the curve and the view. It’s an exquisite place.” Utrecht in the Netherlands – “It’s the town that has had the most dramatic effect on me. It’s beautiful. Street trees everywhere. Very safe. “Although I’ve cycled in London and various other places, the sense of liberation as you cycle around Utrecht and a whole bunch of other Dutch cities is absolutely life-changing. You’re completely safe, you can go anywhere. “It’s a perfectly sized city, quite compact, and within not many minutes you’re going from the city centre into the suburbs and out into the countryside.” And his least favourite? “The train station at Swindon is of grotesque ugliness and the Walkie-Talkie [skyscraper] in London. Those are two very ugly buildings.” • This article was amended on 2 January 2024. The Conservatives lost a byelection in Chesham and Amersham, Buckinghamshire, in 2021, not in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, as an earlier version said."

Details of the sales – equating to 1,589 bottles – were obtained by the Scottish National party, which claimed this proved the Lords was “archaic and out of touch” at the time of a raging cost of living crisis.   Related: UK ministers asked to explain fourth delay to Covid wine cellar report   “A parliament where unelected Lords glug fizz and collect £342 a day just for showing up is not a parliament fit to properly represent the people,” said Tommy Sheppard, the SNP MP for Edinburgh East. Figures released after a freedom of information request showed that, over the course of the year, 1,589 bottles of champagne were bought at a total cost of £88,987 – about £56 each. The cost is up slightly from the 2022 total, when 1,580 bottles were sold at a cost of £85,462. The SNP has no representatives in the House of Lords because of its opposition to the unelected second chamber. “Voters will be fizzing to hear that, while they were struggling to balance household finances and pay for basics like groceries and energy, unelected Lords were glugging back champagne,” added Sheppard. “The past year has been defined by Westminster’s cost of living crisis that has seen living standards plummet and countless more households pushed into poverty and deprivation – a reality alien to the Lords and their lavish lifestyles.”A spokesperson for the House of Lords said that all alcohol, including champagne, sold in the House of Lords was sold at a profit. “Most of the champagne sold by the House of Lords is bought by visitors in the gift shop and consumed away from parliament by members of the public, or sold at banqueting events to organisations or individuals hosting the event in the House of Lords,” the spokesperson added. “It is not paid for by the taxpayer.”"

While polling shows Khan is well clear of Hall in the buildup to May’s vote, his team say the government’s decision to change the electoral system used for the mayoral vote – from supplementary to first past the post – could grant Hall a narrow win. Another complicating factor is the introduction of mandatory photo ID for voting. New polling commissioned by the mayor’s office showed that while 74% of Londoners are aware of the rules, this falls to 53% for younger voters and is also lower among some minority ethnic groups. Khan said the Conservatives had changed the voting system in “a deliberate effort to depress turnout [which] could open the door to a hard-right victory”. He directly likened Hall to Trump, the expected Republican candidate in November’s US presidential election, and Geert Wilders, whose far-right, anti-Islam Party for Freedom won the most seats in the Dutch parliament in November. “The mayoral election will likely be the first test of whether the extreme right can be held back,” Khan said. “Following Geert Wilders’ victory on our doorstep we know the far right are a real threat in European elections, and the prospects of another Donald Trump presidency could be even worse than his disastrous first term.” He added: “Here in London, one of the most diverse cities in the world, my Tory opponent in the mayoral election in May is someone who has repeatedly promoted divisive and racist content on social media, while attacking women and the Black community.” Previous research by the campaign group Hope Not Hate into the social media history of Hall, a London assembly member who has been a strong backer of Trump and of Liz Truss, showed she had liked tweets praising Enoch Powell, who became a byword for racism in UK politics after his “rivers of blood” speech in 1968 about immigration. At the time a spokesperson for Hall said she regularly engaged with people on Twitter, now known as X, “without endorsing their views and wholly condemns any racism or Islamophobia on the platform”. Hall also retweeted a message from the far-right activist Katie Hopkins that called Khan “the nipple height mayor of Londonistan”, adding: “Thank you Katie!” Londonistan is a common term of Islamophobic abuse, often used by the far right, to claim London has been taken over by Muslims. On the changes to the voting system, Khan said the Conservative government had echoed moves by other rightwing governments in “moving the goalposts to maximise their chances of winning – making it as hard as possible for potential progressives to vote and win”. Previous mayoral elections were held under the supplementary vote system, where voters could express a first and second choice, with their vote moving to the latter if their initial choice was knocked out. This often meant many Liberal Democrat and Green votes were transferred to Labour, but the move to first past the post means a split vote on the left could result in Hall becoming mayor with a relatively small minority of support. A spokesperson for Hall said: “Susan won’t take lectures on misogyny from Sadiq Khan, nor will Londoners be fooled by these desperate smear tactics after eight years of failure under his mayoralty. Londoners deserve so much better in 2024, with less crime and an end to his unfair Ulez expansion, and Susan is determined to deliver it.”"
