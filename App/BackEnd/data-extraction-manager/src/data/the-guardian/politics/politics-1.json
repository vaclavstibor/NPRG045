        "content": "Jeremy Hunt’s budget appears to have backfired - with almost twice as many voters believing it will increase taxes overall, as those who think it will mean tax cuts. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer, conducted after the budget, also shows that the Tories have fallen two points in the past two weeks, suffering the reverse of a “budget bounce”. Hunt and prime minister Rishi Sunak had wanted what is likely to be the last budget before a general election to be seen as evidence that the economy was on the mend. Sunak, in particular, wanted to deliver an eye-catching tax cut to demonstrate the government was putting money back in people’s pockets. The centrepiece of the budget was a two percentage point cut in employees’ national insurance (NI) contributions, worth £450 a year to an employee on an average salary of £35,000. However, economists and thinktanks pointed out that other less trumpeted measures in the budget, including the continued freezing of thresholds at which people start paying higher rates of tax, had the effect of increasing taxes overall.  Interactive  Compared with two weeks ago, the Tories have dropped two points to just 25%, while Labour has fallen one point to 41%. This puts Labour’s lead up one point at 16 points. Asked whether they thought that as a result of the budget levels of tax had gone up or down, some 31% of respondents said they believed they had gone up despite the national insurance cut, with just 17% believing they had gone down. A total of 29% thought they had not changed. Hunt’s net approval rating has also fallen marginally compared with the previous poll by Opinium two weeks ago. Just 22% of people approve of the way he is doing his job, compared with 21% a fortnight ago. But 45% now disapprove of Hunt’s performance, an increase of three points, giving him a net rating of 22%.  Interactive  James Crouch, head of public affairs and policy at Opinium, said: “Few were expecting one budget to turn around a double-digit polling deficit but Jeremy Hunt will be disappointed that the headline tax-cut he spent so long trying to find headroom for has failed to register. “Ultimately, if the Conservatives want this budget to have a positive impact on their electoral chances then they have to hope that voters feel the effect of the NI cut and any economic recovery more than they feel the other pressures on cost of living that have dominated for the past two years.”"

        "content": "Boris Johnson flew to Venezuela in February for unofficial talks with its autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, according to reports. The former prime minister spoke to the Venezuelan president about the war in Ukraine, amid concerns that the socialist republic could supply weapons or military support to Russia, according to the Sunday Times. He also discussed the conditions for normalising relations with the UK, which does not accept the legitimacy of Maduro’s administration. Maduro has been in power for 11 years. Johnson’s office told the Sunday Times that the foreign secretary, David Cameron, was aware of the visit and that Johnson also spoke to Colin Dick, the most senior British diplomat in the country. A Foreign Office source said Johnson notified Lord Cameron of the summit en route, saying: “It was a private visit but Boris texted the foreign secretary on the way.” As it was not an official discussion, permission was neither required nor sought. The talks are unorthodox given the state of bilateral relations and wider uncertainty about western relations with Venezuela, which will hold presidential elections on 28 July. The South American country has the world’s largest oil reserves. It has been a supporter of President Putin and blamed the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Nato. Johnson, 59, is understood to have boarded a private jet in February from a family holiday in the Dominican Republic to a location outside Caracas, where he spent less than 24 hours. His spokesperson said: “Boris Johnson met Venezuelan government officials with active support from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the knowledge of the foreign secretary, in order to emphasise the need for Venezuela to embrace a proper democratic process. “He repeatedly made clear there can be no hope of normalisation in relations until Venezuela fully embraces democracy and respects the territorial integrity of its neighbours. He also set out the case for the cause of Ukrainian victory to the government of Venezuela.” The FCDO was contacted for comment. Last month, human rights groups called for the Venezuelan government to halt a crackdown on civil society after it jailed prominent lawyer Rocío San Miguel and then banished a UN human rights office from Caracas for criticising her arrest. “The expulsion of the UN high commissioner and his office is the latest attempt from the government to isolate itself from international scrutiny on its human rights record,” said Valentina Ballesta, Amnesty International’s researcher for South America. “The international community must not give up on shining a spotlight on this issue.” Maduro and other senior Venezuelan officials have been accused by the UN human rights council of committing crimes against humanity, including torture, kidnapping and extrajudicial killings."

        "content": "All members of Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet are to meet top civil servants in Whitehall departments before Easter as Labour steps up preparations to form the next government, according to senior party sources. The Observer has been told that Starmer recently held a first round of so-called “access talks” with the cabinet secretary Simon Case, the head of the civil service, at a “neutral venue” in London, to kick off an exchange of information between the official opposition and Whitehall in advance of a potential handover of power. A senior party figure added that the intention was that Starmer’s session with Case would be followed within the next three weeks by meetings between all of Starmer’s top team and the permanent secretaries who run departments they shadow. The source said: “We want all shadow cabinet members to meet permanent secretaries in the relevant departments before Easter. With an election coming, maybe as early as May, we need to get a move on.” Access talks are a vital part of pre-election planning to ensure a smooth transition, in the event that the opposition forms the next government. They also begin the process under which opposition politicians and civil servants begin building relationships, rather than having to start from scratch on day one after an election. The Institute of Government think tank says: “Because the handover of power usually takes place overnight, access talks are the only opportunity for the civil service and an incoming government to exchange information and establish relationships with each other in advance of the potential handover date. Access talks are unique: civil servants do not normally meet with opposition MPs.” Access talks with Labour have, however, been shrouded in high levels of secrecy, because the party under Starmer is determined not to be seen as taking power for granted. “There is paranoia about giving the impression of measuring the curtains, and being seen as complacent. It is not in the bag,” said a senior insider. Following last week’s budget, MPs at seem increasingly convinced that Labour is on course to form the next government. Despite the chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to give working people a second cut in their national insurance payments within the past few months, today’s Opinium poll for the Observer shows no sign of a post-budget Tory bounce, with more voters believing that the budget increased their taxes rather than lowered them. Labour, on 41% (down one point since a fortnight ago) has extended its lead to 16 points over the Tories, who have fallen by 2 points to 25%. Labour also believes Hunt has handed them a strategic gift by holding out the prospect of further cuts in national insurance – and even the possibility of abolishing it altogether – without saying how such a move would be funded.  Interactive  Speaking to the Observer, the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves made clear that Labour – which recently dropped plans to spend £28bn a year on its green prosperity plan amid Tory claims it was unfunded – could now turn the tables on the Conservatives and accuse them of being the party of fiscal irresponsibility. “Labour is now the party of economic responsibility,” Reeves said “whereas the Conservatives are now the party of unfunded tax cuts. That is an argument we will be making from now on and through the election campaign.” Labour says abolishing national insurance would cost £46bn a year, equivalent to £230bn over the course of a five-year parliament. If the Tories went ahead, they claim, it could have the same effect as the Liz Truss mini-budget in 2022, which led to soaring interest and mortgage rates. Reeves added: “Last week, we needed a budget for the long term that could bring about growth and help begin to rebuild our public services. “And yet Jeremy Hunt ended his budget with a £46bn unfunded tax plan to abolish national insurance that would leave a gaping hole in the public finances, put family finances at risk and create huge uncertainty for pensioners. “The last time the Conservatives implemented such a proposal was when Liz Truss was prime minister and millions of people are still paying the price for that disastrous mini-budget.” Another member of Starmer’s shadow cabinet said Hunt’s suggestion about getting rid of national insurance would allow Labour to counter the traditional Tory attacks. “We can smash all their arguments to pieces and turn them on their head. They have just offered up £46bn of unfunded tax cuts.”  Interactive  Opinium’s post-budget polling found Labour had a commanding lead on issues of economic competence – which have traditionally been strong suits for the Conservatives.When asked which party they thought would spend government money efficiently, 34% said Labour against 22% for the Conservatives, and 33% said they would trust a Labour government led by Keir Starmer to run the economy efficiently, compared with 26% who would trust Rishi Sunak and the Tories. When asked who would be best for their own personal finances, 33% said Labour, and just 20% the Tories. Despite the two percentage points cut in national insurance in the budget, 31% of those questioned thought that the overall effect of Hunt’s decisions had been to put their taxes up rather than reduce them."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-03-09T18:41:15+00:00",
        "content": "Michael Gove is set to announce a controversial plan this week to ban individuals and groups who “undermine the UK’s system of liberal democracy” from public life, despite fears inside government that the scheme is at risk of a legal challenge, leaked documents reveal. Officials working for Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, have drawn up plans for “trailblazer” departments to pilot the scheme, according to documents that have been circulated to the Home Office and Downing Street and seen by the Observer. Organisations and individuals that breach a new official definition of extremism will be excluded from meetings or any engagement with ministers, senior civil servants, government advisory boards and funding.  Councils will be expected to follow the government’s lead, cutting any financial ties or support to individuals or groups that have been categorised as extremist. The proposed new definition of extremism – first revealed by the Observer in November – says “core behaviours” that could constitute extremism include attempts to “overturn, exploit or undermine the UK’s system of liberal democracy to confer advantages or disadvantages on specific groups” or threatening ­individual rights or enabling the spread of extremism. In internal briefing papers, Gove’s officials admit there is a risk of a legal challenge. Gove already faces strong opposition to the plans, including from civil liberties groups, officials and some senior Tory MPs. “The government wants to launch this without a public consultation on the definition, or proper engagement with faith leaders,” said one official who has seen the proposals. “It’s never going to work.” New measures to target groups defined as extremist by the government are part of Rishi Sunak’s drive to crack down on Islamist extremists and far-right groups.  He warned in a speech outside No 10 on 1 March of streets that had been “hijacked by small groups” and protests that had descended into “intimidation, threats, and planned actions of violence”. Civil liberties groups are concerned it could brand legitimate organisations and individuals as extremists, suppressing freedom of speech. Some Tory MPs also fear that it could be used to ban socially conservative groups – for example, those that oppose same-sex marriage or abortion. “Refusing to engage with groups it disagrees with is becoming a pattern of behaviour from this government,” said Akiko Hart, director of Liberty. “It’s vital those in power do not silence the people set to be most affected by its policies.” The vetting scheme for the new policy has not yet been established. The briefing documents suggest that “trailblazer” departments will pilot the scheme. It is expected that the vetting units will check individuals and groups under new standards, which include demonstrating “any of the behaviours set out in the 2024 definition of extremism”. The documents circulated by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities warn: “There are some risks to this approach, including greater risk of legal challenge if we publish the principles without the due diligence system being operational.” Robin Simcox, the government’s commissioner for countering extremism, suggested in an article in the Telegraph last week that London should no longer be permitted “to be turned into a no-go zone for Jews every weekend”, referring to the regular pro-Palestinian marches. An official at the Board of Deputies of British Jews told the Times that while many British Jews felt unsafe in central London during the marches, he was not “particularly comfortable with the language of ‘no-go zones’.” In 2011, the government’s Prevent strategy defined extremism as the “active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs”. The government proposed a bill in 2016 to “tackle the menace of extremism”, but it was shelved after the government failed to provide a legally acceptable definition of extremism. Alex Carlile, a crossbench peer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said there was a risk in proposing a new definition.  He said: “A good definition would ensure a greater level of consistency in the way in which, for example, the policing of demonstrations takes place. If it is not a good definition, we risk making things worse.” Lord Carlile said he did not consider a new definition was necessary because there were laws already in place to deal with extremist groups, but more guidance for police forces in dealing with extremist groups would be helpful. The initial documents identified eight groups that could be captured by a proposed new definition of extremism, including the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) and Palestine Action. The MCB would be captured on “historical” grounds, according to the internal documents, and for refusing to “repudiate or rescind past behaviours”, and for its association with those who have demonstrated extremist behaviours, without providing critical challenge.   Related: No 10 faces Tory backlash over plans to broaden extremism definition   The government has not confirmed whether it will identify specific groups when it launches the new extremism definition. It faces the risk of a legal challenge in banning individuals and organisations from funding and engagement with public bodies, based on a definition that is not enshrined in law. A MCB spokesperson said: “Extremism and terrorism are serious matters that require real leadership and not cynical electioneering. To suggest that the Muslim Council of Britain would fall under arbitrary definitions of extremism is offensive, ludicrous and dangerous. “We are a democratic organisation representing a cross-section of British Muslims. After standing accused of peddling Islamophobia, it is ironic that the governing party should lash out and accuse everyone else but themselves of extremism. We shall be monitoring developments and will seek to reserve our position legally.” Palestine Action said no new definition would deter it from campaigning.  A government spokesperson said:“We are taking action to ensure that no extremist organisations or individuals are being given a platform by their actions and interactions with government. We will set out further details shortly.”"

        "content": "Two serving ministers have called for a “much greater pace” of investment in defence spending, putting pressure on Rishi Sunak a day after the Commons’ spending watchdog warned that the Ministry of Defence had no credible plan to fund the military capabilities the government wants. The Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Home Office minister Tom Tugendhat said in a post on LinkedIn that the UK needed to “lead the way” by increasing defence and security spending to at least 2.5% of gross domestic product, a measure of the size of the economy. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said “our spending will rise to 2.5% as soon as economic conditions allow” – surpassing the Nato-wide target of 2% – but provided no details of how that would happen. “The sad truth is that the world is no longer benign,” Trevelyan and Tugendhat wrote. “Protecting ourselves requires investment. And effective investment means that our industrial complex must grow and strengthen at much greater pace than at present.” The article was not required to be cleared by No 10 because it was a social media post. It was also in line with government policy on increasing spending to 2.5%. But the article by the senior Tories signals unease within the ranks over defence spending – an unease reflected in the findings of the public accounts committee. On Friday, the committee published a report calling for the government to get firmer control of defence procurement, noting that the defence ministry had become “increasingly reliant on the UK’s allies to protect our national interests”. The report found that the gap between the defence ministry’s budget and the cost of the UK’s desired military capabilities had increased to £16.9bn – its largest deficit to date – but the committee warned that the real deficit could be closer to £29bn. “In an increasingly volatile world, the Ministry of Defence’s lack of a credible plan to deliver fully funded military capability as desired by government leaves us in an alarming place,” said Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee. In response to the report, a No 10 spokesperson told the PA news agency: “The prime minister has overseen the largest sustained defence spending increase since the end of the cold war and a £24bn uplift in cash terms over the spending review period. “We are ensuring that we have the largest defence budget in history, increasing spend and ensuring that we have the funding that we need to protect UK national interests.” In their article, Trevelyan, the Indo-Pacific minister, and security minister Tugendhat said they were concerned about the level of defence spending needed to respond to China, which announced this week that it was increasing its defence spending by another 7.2%, and Russia, which has committed to spending 40% of its expenditure on defence – much of that in Ukraine. “It’s clear to us that the UK needs to lead the way in increasing our own domestic defence and security spending commitments to 2.5% and beyond,” they wrote. “Former defence secretary Ben Wallace and prime minister Boris Johnson made inroads into growing our defence budgets, which had been shrinking in real terms for years. But that only filled the hole. Now we need growth.” They called for an investment in defence and security industry, a strengthening of the UK’s nuclear deterrent and a growing of the country’s munitions lines, in part to help bolster the efforts in Ukraine. “We cannot turn on the complex platforms and weapons which ensure military advantage overnight,” they wrote. “We must start that growth now, invest at pace to support our allies and stay ahead of our adversaries.”"

        "content": "Bridget Phillipson has accused Gillian Keegan of “demeaning” the office of education secretary by saying she would probably have punched Ofsted inspectors, describing Keegan’s remarks as “pathetic”. Keegan told a headteacher’s conference on Friday that she would “have probably punched” rude Ofsted inspectors, based on an account she had heard during a recent school visit. Phillipson, the Labour shadow secretary, said Keegan’s language was not befitting of a cabinet minister responsible for schools in England. “This is sadly another example of the way in which Gillian Keegan has demeaned her office as secretary of state. And to do so in front of an audience of school leaders – many of whom are themselves Ofsted inspectors, and take that responsibility very seriously – is frankly pathetic,” Phillipson said. “It’s not behaviour that befits a secretary of state for education. But sadly, we’ve seen many, many examples of such behaviour at a time when we need greater respect for education, where we need parents and government to work together to tackle some of these big challenges that we face, for example around attendance. These comments from the secretary of state do absolutely nothing to help that.” Phillipson listed other examples, including Keegan’s “sweary outburst” about how well she had performed as education secretary, as well as suggesting that children like studying in portable classrooms. “She should just get on and do the job and show the profession a bit of respect,” Phillipson suggested. In her speech to the Association of School and College Leaders conference in Liverpool, Phillipson also attacked Keegan’s comments about the provision of special educational needs and disabilities (Send), with Keegan admitting that the system was “lose, lose, lose” despite the government “spending a fortune”. Describing the challenges facing children and families with Send as “enormous”, Phillipson told the conference: “The next Labour government will have to do better.” With the numbers of children in England issued with an education, health and care plan surging in recent years, schools and local authorities have found themselves unable to cope with the increase in demand for support and services, including special school places and therapy. Speaking to journalists, Phillipson said: “After 14 years it will take us time to turn that around. What I’m determined to do, if we win the next election, is to have an early focus on reforming the system, and alongside that intervening far earlier in children’s lives.” When asked for more detail about Labour’s plans, Phillipson said an incoming government would need “a much fuller understanding, if we win the election, as to the full extent of just how chaotic the system has become”. She added: “I think families of children with Send have had enough of a system that isn’t delivering but have also had enough of promises from politicians that just haven’t been kept. And I’m not prepared to do that.”   Related: Hundreds of children with special needs wait a year for support in England   Geoff Barton, the outgoing ASCL general secretary, warned that the government’s recent tax cuts spelled more funding difficulties for schools. “If, for example, you cut taxes before a general election there is a price to pay further down the road. The quality of public services will suffer,” Barton said. He said it was “unarguable” that schools in England had been underfunded for the past 14 years. “On the current trajectory, with declining pupil numbers, with such low funding rates, there’s a very serious risk of schools – like local authorities – going bust, and in some cases, particularly small primary schools, actually having to close. “Schools will have to further cut their curriculum options, there will be less pastoral and specialist support for those pupils with additional needs, simply because there won’t be enough money to do those things.”"

        "content": "Momentum is considering opening up its membership to people outside the Labour party in an attempt to energise a broader leftwing movement in the lead-up to the general election. Insiders say a shift in the group’s membership model will make it a “powerful force” and will ensure its financial sustainability and relevance if Keir Starmer becomes prime minister. Momentum currently requires supporters to be members of Labour – a rule that is having a knock-on effect on its funding as thousands of leftwingers have deserted the party under Starmer. If the motion is passed Momentum would hold the same membership criteria as the leftwing thinktank the Fabian Society, which is still deemed closely associated with the Labour party and has influenced Labour policy. While there is internal support for the motion, some have voiced concern that unions may veto the vote. The Guardian understands the Communication Workers Union which is affiliated to Momentum, has more than 100,000 members and as a result will get twice the weighted delegation size within the grassroots group. James Schneider, a co-founder of Momentum, said: “We want organisational inheritance from Corbyn that is able to be a force for our politics in British society. It needs to be open to the vast majority of people who could play a major part in that and that means people that are Labour members or people that are not Labour members.” A leftwing Labour source said the membership rule change may embolden MPs who are “still fearful of being sidelined” by the current leadership. Schneider said the membership change could create a “positive knock-on effect” within the Labour left. “Across the broader left there’s energy and activity. The Labour left is in a defensive crouch. There can be purpose in strategic retreat. But if the defensive crouch is stopping you from doing anything great it’s illustrative of some of the unnecessary cowed fear that we need to break out of on the Labour left … you should argue for your politics and then argue why they’re legitimate when the leadership tries to come for you.” The timing of the motion and Momentum’s convention comes as a number of independent leftwing candidates are preparing their general election campaigns, some directly challenging Starmer’s Labour party. A prominent figure on Labour’s left hinted there will be “quite a lot of excitement” about supporting specific seats where there is a “credible left of Labour challenge”. In some areas, the source said: “There will be a lot of leftwing independent candidates of various stripes possibly in the same seat, which could be a bit of a distraction.” A Labour membership rule change passed at last year’s conference means Labour members will be automatically expelled from the party if they campaign for independent candidates. Hilary Schan, a Momentum co-chair, said: “This weekend’s convention will be a testament to the enduring strength of our grassroots movement. Amidst the rubble of the Tories’ broken Britain, the need for bold and transformative solutions has never been clearer.  “As a member-led force, we will keep campaigning for a fairer, more equal Britain for months and years to come, powered by thousands of ordinary people up and down the country.”"

        "content": "Hours after Wednesday’s budget, the Conservative party’s great and good assembled under the sweeping stone arches of the medieval Guildhall in London to hear Rishi Sunak address the 50th anniversary dinner for the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank. His party had a clear plan, the prime minister told hundreds of Tory MPs, peers, donors and other assorted luminaries: one centred on higher growth and lower taxes. Many of those gathered had listened in person as Jeremy Hunt unveiled another 2p cut in national insurance but failed to produce anything approximating the rabbit-from-a-hat announcement that Tory MPs hoped might start shifting the polls. Sunak’s remarks were therefore greeted with scepticism, and some even raised eyebrows and politely shook heads. One attender called the event the “most opulent funeral I’ve ever been to”. It is by no means uncommon for governments to run out of energy as they approach the end of a long period in office. But the gallows humour on show on Wednesday night was indicative of a mood some Tory insiders say goes further: a sense that many in the party have almost entirely given up. Perhaps the most obvious metric for this is the running tally of MPs deciding that they do not wish to stand again. Even with the general election potentially still six months or more away, of the 96 standing down so far, 61 are Conservatives.   Related: Theresa May: loyal constituency MP who lost Tory support over Brexit   The 61st to declare their intention was Theresa May, who made her announcement on Friday morning. While it is not necessarily unusual for a 67-year-old former prime minister who has spent 27 years in the Commons to decide enough is enough, there is a general sense of the decks being cleared ahead of a possibly calamitous defeat to Labour. Another vignette came from one party member who said they had noticed a big upsurge in Conservative special advisers and thinktank staff applying to join the exclusive Carlton Club, primarily in the hope of using it to network for another job. Hunt’s budget has become the latest of a succession of policy ideas to make no dent in Labour’s polling lead of about 20 points. Some within the Conservatives worry that, among some MPs and advisers, a perhaps inevitable sense of ennui has become a cross between outright defeatism and a willing gallop towards the waiting abyss. “We’re stuffed,” one Tory MP said, despondently if succinctly, after Sunak’s speech on Wednesday night. A wealthy Tory donor also attending simply pondered how Labour would address his specialist policy area “when” they were in government. One opposition MP said they had been struck by the atmosphere in the Commons during Hunt’s budget speech. “It was interesting watching the Tory MPs as he built up to the NI cut,” they said. “That’s the part where they’d all be expected to cheer really loudly, but most of them just looked a bit miserable. It was like they don’t care any more.” Even if, as most assume, Sunak will delay a general election until the autumn, the Conservatives must gear themselves up for local and mayoral elections across England on 2 May – and the signs do not look good. One of the most high-profile races will be for London mayor, where Labour’s Sadiq Khan seems set for an unprecedented third term against his somewhat lacklustre Conservative opponent, Susan Hall, whose official website has only been updated twice since October. “The Tory campaign is a bit weird,” one Labour source said. “All Hall seems to do is knock on doors in outer suburbs and talk about crime. We’ve barely seen her.” The council elections could be even more problematic, not least because the Conservatives will be defending seats last fought in 2021 – the 2020 elections were delayed a year due to Covid – when Boris Johnson was still enjoying something of a post-vaccine bounce. Perhaps even more alarming for Sunak than the prospect of heavy losses is the number of Tory councillors who are quitting before they can be defeated. At one Conservative-run council in the party’s affluent heartlands, all but two sitting councillors are understood to have said they will not stand again, including the leader. While the picture was mixed across areas, one Conservative source said, overall morale was “pretty bad”, with officials finding it difficult to even raise volunteers to go out canvassing. “I think it’s partly people going, ‘What’s the point in canvassing? We’re not going to win over any swing voters, so why not just send out some leaflets?’” they said. “It’s also about the reception we get on the doorstep. In 2022, after Partygate, lots of voters really hated us. But now they just expect us to lose. If there’s one thing worse than being hated, it’s being laughed at.” There is increasing frustration among some Tory MPs and ministers that efforts to trim Labour’s poll lead by focusing on core issues have been repeatedly undermined by controversies or bickering between factions. “Whenever I speak to constituents, all they want to talk about is the cost of living and the NHS,” one minister lamented. “We should be hammering home the message about the economy and how it is getting better, every day. But we keep fucking up.” There is a growing sense that some of those rocking the boat are mainly focused on increasing their chances of leading the post-defeat Tories, or even hoping for a calamitous result so that they can reshape a rump party in their ideological image. “These people are Tory Trotskyists, they just want to bring down the whole system and start again,” the minister said. “You have a group of MPs who know they’ll keep their seats no matter what, so they don’t care how bad the defeat is. Then you get the ones who know they’ll lose their seats, and they also don’t care.” One party official said there was an increasing dissonance between these types and the Tory MPs who still believed the scale of a loss could be mitigated. “The problem with some of these people is they have never been in opposition,” the official said. “They think, ‘Well, we’ll lose, but I might be leader.’ But they simply don’t realise how much less attention you get in opposition. They also don’t realise how much less attention you’ll get if you’re leader of a really small group of MPs. “The assumption is that we’ll lose, but there are still very big differences in how we might lose – and whether that means we’re out of office for five years, or 20.” There is, however, a little more to it. As well as enthusiasm and volunteers, general elections run on money, and this is one resource the Conservatives still have in abundance, not least after receiving £10m from the healthcare tech entrepreneur Frank Hester. One Liberal Democrat source said the party, which hopes to seize dozens of Tory-held seats at the election, had noticed a massive upsurge in paid-for leaflets delivered to voters’ doors. “We’re seeing enormous amounts of campaign literature in most of the seats they hold and in almost all our target seats,” they said. “There are also tons of digital ads – they’re spending like there’s no tomorrow.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has the worst record on appointing women from his party to the House of Lords of any prime minister since John Major, with female Conservative peers making up only 17% of those recommended by him, a report has found. The analysis, from the campaign group Unlock Democracy, found just four women were appointed out of 23 new Tory peers created during his time in office. Sunak has been responsible for putting forward lists of peerages suggested by his predecessors Liz Truss and Boris Johnson when they resigned. But he has also made a number of ad hoc appointments of peers of his own and only two out of 13 – or 15% of them – are women. Sunak’s female appointment rates to the House of Lords compares with 37.5% of Tory peers appointed under Truss, 20.9% by appointed under Johnson, 46.2% under May, and 30% under Cameron. Under Labour, 18% of party peer appointments under Gordon Brown were women but he also had a Labour list of resignation peerages of which half were women, while about 24% of Labour peer appointments under Tony Blair were female. There are 233 women out of 796 members of the House of Lords, or 29%, making it even less gender balanced than the House of Commons, where 226 out of 650 MPs are women – or 35%. The report by Unlock Democracy, published on International Women’s Day, found that if every woman ever to have been made a peer was still alive and sitting in the House of Lords today, men would still comfortably outnumber women by nearly two to one. Although female representation in the Lords has risen each decade since 1960, when it stood at 0.6%, the report notes that the pace has slowed in recent years, with the number of women peers rising 1% since 2020. According to the analysis, in the 16 months since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, only 27% of his overall peerage appointments, including those from all parties and crossbenchers, have gone to women – the lowest proportion since Tony Blair was prime minister, when the figure was 23.5%. The trend in the proportion of female appointments has been downward since peaking with Theresa May, under whose premiership 39.5% of peerages went to women. Unlock Democracy said the simplest, and quickest way to redress the balance would be for the prime minister only to appoint female peers – except in exceptional circumstances – until the House reaches 50/50. Helena Kennedy KC, the president of Unlock Democracy and a Labour member of the House of Lords, said: “Not one of the 14 prime ministers able to do so has nominated more women than men for peerages. As this new report shows, even in the best decade, nearly twice as many men were being appointed as women. “This matters, not just in terms of legitimacy, but also for the way we make decisions. Important perspectives are missing in debates because for nearly 70 years the Lords has not been able to draw on the full talent pool available. “The House of Lords Act of 1999 – which I campaigned for as part of Charter 88 – delivered a dramatic change in terms of the proportion of female to male peers, but progress has slowed. “Fortunately, the prime minister has it in his power, at the stroke of a pen, to do something about this. I would urge Mr Sunak to take this simple step and mark International Women’s Day with a promise to appoint only female peers from now on.” Women were first allowed to sit in the House of Lords from 1958 with the passage of the Life Peerages Act. Before then, the seats were purely hereditary, passing down the male line only. Parliamentary data shows that only 348 of the 1,584 life peers to have been appointed have been women – a ratio of more than four men to every woman. Lynne Featherstone, a former equalities minister and a Lib Dem peer, said: “It is unacceptable that this chamber – which draws on the skills and expertise of those who have contributed beyond the norm to our lives – perpetuates the old male and stale dominant status quo … The woeful gender imbalance of the Lords diminishes its potential for wisdom, knowledge and experience. It needs to be addressed – and fast.” A government official said: “We are keen to ensure that public appointments and dignities represent the United Kingdom in all its forms, but we do not support rigid quotas.” Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, held a special mentoring session in No 10 to honour International Women’s Day with female role models and business leaders for girls and young women. Before the event, she spoke of her own mother, Sudha, 73, who was on Friday appointed to serve a term in the upper chamber of India’s parliament – the equivalent of the UK’s House of Lords. Murty said: “I know the phenomenal work that goes into running a business. My mother’s endeavours in science, technology, engineering and maths allowed her to push boundaries both academically and professionally and gave her a ringside seat to the technological revolution. “I hope other women and girls are inspired by role models around them to pursue their own passions.” Most of India’s upper chamber is elected but the president nominates about 12 people a year who are considered high achievers to serve six-year terms. Sunak marked International Women’s Day with a reception for inspirational female leaders in Downing Street. “I am committed to delivering the long-term change needed to build a brighter future for women and girls,” he said."

In a statement to the Maidenhead Advertiser, the Maidenhead MP said she wanted to focus on causes close to her heart, including her work on the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.\nLabour has said that the wave of Conservative MPs stepping down at the next election shows a lack of confidence in Rishi Sunak’s government, as former prime minister Theresa May announced she was joining the more than 60 Tory MPs exiting parliament.\nA 22-year-old who could become Labour’s youngest ever MP and just the second openly trans member of the House of Commons has described the opportunity to reach Westminster as “mind boggling”.\nEducation secretary Gillian Keegan has raised eyebrows by telling a conference this morning that she would have probably “punched” an Ofsted inspector she heard about.\n\n\n\n\n 3.32pm GMT \n\nCharlotte Owen, a former aide to Boris Johnson who became the youngest ever life peer in the House of Lords, has said Deepfake abuse is the “new frontier” of violence against women and creating such content should be outlawed.\nBaroness Owen of Alderley Edge warned existing legislation only bans the non-consensual sharing of deepfake material and does not tackle the non-consensual creation of the content.\nPeers heard there has been an increase in so-called nudify apps, which allow users to create fake nude images or videos of other people through generative artificial intelligence - widely known as deepfakes.\nLady Owen said the ability to create such content on the apps in a matter of seconds “represents a very real threat to all women”.\n\nUpdated at 3.32pm GMT\n\n\n 3.11pm GMT \nLabour candidate, 22, could become party's youngest ever MP\n\nA 22-year-old who could become Labour’s youngest ever MP and just the second openly trans member of the House of Commons has described the opportunity to reach Westminster as “mind boggling”.\nGeorgia Meadows, 22, found out she was Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Witney, which lies on the edge of the Cotswolds and is roughly 15 miles west of Oxford, on 29 February – Leap Day – and officially announced her candidacy on social media on Thursday.\nMeadows will be the youngest ever Labour MP if elected, unless that mantle goes to 21-year-old Luke Charters-Reid, who will run for Labour in the York Outer constituency in the next general election.\nDespite the Conservatives securing a majority of 15,177 in the 2019 general election, Meadows told the PA news agency she believes her party has a “real chance of winning” the seat from the Conservatives.\n\n\nI am beyond ecstatic to be able to announce that I am the Labour Party's PPC for Witney. pic.twitter.com/xbzylGjcrC— Georgia Meadows (@MsGrgaMeadows) March 7, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.25pm GMT\n\n\n 2.50pm GMT \n\nNearly 50 organisations have joined forces to condemn what they call a “crackdown” on the right to protest by the UK government.\nIn response to Rishi Sunak’s recent remarks on extremism and “mob rule” linked to protesters, Amnesty International UK and 45 others have sent a letter to the prime minister calling for “leadership, not censorship”.\nRead more here:\n\n Related: Open letter to Sunak condemns ‘crackdown’ on right to protest \n\n\n\n\n 2.28pm GMT \n\nThe next UK general election is looming, with most analysts expecting it to be called late this year.\nFind out who’s up and who’s down in the latest polls – and how many seats each party is likely to win in the next general election:\n\n Related: UK general election opinion polls tracker: Labour leading as election looms \n\n\n\n\n 1.58pm GMT \n\nMike Short, head of education at Unison has criticised Gillian Keegan’s earlier comments that she might have “punched” an Ofsted inspector who was “rude” when visiting a school.\nShort said:\n\nClearly there’s much that can and should be improved in the way Ofsted inspections are carried out. But to suggest punching people is an appropriate reaction is not becoming of a Government minister.\nMaking light of violence in schools when staff are increasingly likely to face assaults while doing their job is in very poor taste. Ofsted inspectors are already dealing with a great deal of hostility while they work. So much for showing respect.\n\n\n\n\n 1.12pm GMT \n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has used the occasion of International Women’s Day to write for the Independent today about how she intends to “speak, and act, in the interests of women” over the economy, promising “an economic policy centred on equality for women” which would “also be an economic policy centred on growth.\nShe writes:\n\nOne of the things that successive Conservative governments have got wrong is to think we can build a strong economy based on the success of a few people, a few places, and a few industries. We have seen where that leads: stuttering growth, stagnant productivity, and deep regional divides.\nLabour’s alternative is about the recognition that if we want to build a strong economy, that must be based on the contribution of the many. And that must mean a growth plan centred around women.\n\nShe goes on to cite the fact that Labour have commissioned a review into how they can go further and faster in closing the gender pay gap, and says that a future Labour industrial strategy will not be “top-down, narrow-focused” like the past, but focus on what she describes as “the everyday economy” which, she says, includes “childcare, social care and retail”.\nDescribing the Conservative “flagship commitment” of more childcare hours as “little more than hot air” she writes the “the UK’s broken childcare system won’t be fixed with gimmicks – which is why Labour has commissioned an expert-led early years review, headed by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, David Bell.”\nYou can read it all here.\n\n\n\n 1.04pm GMT \n\nFirst minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, has said Conservative MPs in the north-east of Scotland who back the windfall tax extension will be punished at the general election.\nPA Media reports Yousaf told it the Conservatives have “sold out” the north-east, accusing West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie of doing it so “he can keep his ministerial car and ministerial salary. He will need to explain that to the electorate come the general election.”\nYousaf added “We don’t oppose windfall tax. We actually support a windfall tax, one of the first parties to be calling for a windfall tax. But we don’t agree with raiding the north east for a tax cut of £1,500, or Labour’s position of raiding the north-east so they can spend money on new nuclear power plants in England – simply not acceptable.”\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt announced in his budget the levy on oil and gas profits will be extended by a further 12 months to 2029.\n\n\n\n 12.49pm GMT \n\nTheresa May has been out on a constituency visit today, having announced via her local newspaper earlier that she would be stepping down as an MP after 27 years.\nThe former prime minister was visiting an International Women’s Day football event at St Mary’s Catholic Primary School in Maidenhead.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm GMT \nEducation secretary Gillian Keegan says she would have 'punched' rude Ofsted inspectors\n\nEducation secretary Gillian Keegan has raised eyebrows by telling a conference this morning that she would have probably “punched” an Ofsted inspector she heard about.\nSchools Week reports that speaking at the Association of School and College Leaders annual conference, Keegan said:\n\nI heard recently actually from a fantastic school I went into. They told me how their Ofsted experience had gone. I was shocked, I was actually shocked. I thought, ‘God, if I’d met these people, I’d have actually punched them.’ They were really rude. You expect people to be rude to you when you’re a politician. But when you’re trying to run a school and change lives you don’t expect somebody to come in and not be respectful.\n\nKeegan said the key thing to develop good schools was “getting good people, retaining good people, continuing the professional development of good people, listening and respecting to good people.”\nOfsted chief inspector Martyn Oliver, asked about the comments, said he was more interested in “a fresh start and calming down tensions”, but added “people should act with professionalism, courtesy, empathy and respect on both sides.”\nOfsted has faced intense scrutiny after the death of headteacher Ruth Perry, and has today launched in England what it calls the “big listen”, a 12 week consultation which is asking school staff, education organisations and parents for their views across topics including schools, safeguarding, teacher training, and social care.\nKeegan is the tenth secretary for state for education during the last 14 years of Conservative-led governments.\n\n\n\n 12.12pm GMT \n\nForeign secretary and former prime minister David Cameron has praised his successor Theresa May after she announced she was stepping down from parliament five years and one general election after she resigned as prime minister.\nCameron, who stood down as an MP two months after leaving Downing Street, saying he did not want to be a “distraction”, posted to social media to say:\n\nI wish Theresa May well as she stands down. As well as serving as my home secretary and then as PM, she did much to help modernise the Conservative party and promote women in public life. She has been the most dedicated of public servants. The House of Commons will miss her.\n\n\n\nI wish @theresa_may well as she stands down.As well as serving as my Home Secretary and then as PM, she did much to help modernise the Conservative Party and promote women in public life.

Hunt opted to use it to fund a cut in national insurance.\nThat doesn’t appear to have polled well with the public. According to YouGov, having spoken to people about the budget, their polling suggests “the public favour the Labour policy by 52% to 21%”.\n\n\n\n 11.11am GMT \n\nThere is some more reaction to Theresa May’s departure as an MP from Conservative colleagues here, via PA:\nJulian Smith, who served as her chief whip, said: “I am very sorry to see that Theresa May is standing down as an MP. Our second female prime minister is an exceptional public servant with the highest integrity, relentless work ethic and total commitment to all parts of the UK in addition to her passionate campaigning for vital causes around the world.”\nNus Ghani, who gained her first ministerial role under May, said: “Theresa will be missed, she has integrity, determination and made time to support and help so many of us MPs as we learned the snakes and ladders of parliament.”\nCaroline Nokes, immigration minister under Mrs May, said that on International Women’s Day “I want to celebrate a colleague who showed us all the importance of hard work, commitment to your constituency and integrity. Parliament will be poorer (and I’m a bit sad – too many women standing down).”\n\n\n\n 11.09am GMT \n\nWhile he has been in Keighley, Rishi Sunak has been visiting Byworth Boilers, where it appears he has been pressed into doing some wiring.\n\n\n\n 10.54am GMT \nSunak: May is 'an extraordinary and inspiring example' of 'dedicated public service'\n\nThe prime minister is in Keighley, West Yorkshire today, where Rishi Sunak has spoken to the media about Theresa May, and her decision to step down as an MP after 27 years.\n\nObviously on International Women’s Day, it’s important to recognise that Theresa was our second female prime minister, which is an extraordinary achievement.\nAnd actually beyond that, she just has the most amazing track record of dedicated public service over two decades. And that is an extraordinary and inspiring example to anyone.\nAnyone who spent time with her knows how committed she is to public service, not just in her community, but the country. And everyone will miss her sorely.”\n\n\n\n\n 10.42am GMT \n\nIt will not have escaped your attention that a repeated attack line from Rishi Sunak and his frontbench is that Labour do not have a “plan” for being in government. Indeed one suspects that “plan” will be one of the words most typed on this live blog over the coming months.\nKeir Starmer this morning has published a Labour campaign video which leans in to talking about their “plan” for apprenticeships, construction and housing. It opens with Starmer saying “We need a proper the plan for growth, and that’s what the Labour party has set out. We’ve been talking about that plan here on this construction site.”\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves then chips in with “what we need is decent wages so people can support a family, but that means helping businesses grow.”\nStarmer goes on to say that the apprentices in the construction industry they are talking to will be busy for the next few years because Labour’s plan – that word again – is “one-and-a-half million houses in the first five years of a Labour government.”\nHe concludes:\n\nIt is about long term decision making. It is about making sure that public sector investment is matched by private sector investment. That will only happen if we have economic stability. But we only will have economic stability under a Labour government with tight fiscal rules. \n\n\n\nBritain deserves a government that prioritises economic stability. That’s what a Labour government will deliver. pic.twitter.com/g6M28wbelC— Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) March 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.33am GMT \n\nRishi Sunak has paid tribute to Theresa May on social media. May is stepping down at the next election after being an MP for 27 years. Sunak posted:\n\nA relentless campaigner, a fiercely loyal MP to the people of Maidenhead, and Britain’s second female prime minister. Theresa May defines what it means to be a public servant. I have no doubt Theresa will continue to make a positive impact on public life.\n\n\n\n\n 10.23am GMT \n\nKiran Stacey, our political correspondent, has written this profile of the departing Theresa May:\nSome argue that Theresa May’s inability to persuade her party to back her Brexit agreement was a result of her awkward style of personal interaction. She disliked the backslapping nature of the Commons tea rooms, hated small talk and deliberately shunned parliamentary gossip. John Crace, the Guardian’s sketch writer, called her the “Maybot”.\nThose close to her, however, insist that in private she could be warm and sensitive, but that she put up a barrier in public in part to counteract perceptions of weakness as one of Britain’s highest-profile female politicians.\nAs home secretary May championed a range of initiatives to correct what she saw as social injustices, including curtailing police powers to “stop and search”, spearheading efforts to tackle modern slavery and reversing much of Labour’s hard-line antisocial behaviour policies. Much of that, however, was overshadowed by her uncompromising approach to immigration. \nAfter calling the election in 2017 she watched a commanding poll lead evaporate as she fluctuated between presenting herself as a continuity candidate and a headstrong reformer. The campaign unravelled when she was forced to abandon a controversial signature pledge to reform social care, only to insist as she did so that “nothing has changed”.\nRead more of Kiran Stacey’s profile of Theresa May here: Theresa May – loyal constituency MP who lost Tory support over Brexit\n\n Related: Theresa May: loyal constituency MP who lost Tory support over Brexit \n\n\n\n\n 10.18am GMT \nLabour says wave of Tory MPs stepping down shows lack of confidence in Sunak as Theresa May announces exit\n\nLabour has said that the wave of Conservative MPs stepping down at the next election shows a lack of confidence in Rishi Sunak’s government, as former prime minister Theresa May announced she was joining the more than 60 Tory MPs exiting parliament.\nMay will step down as an MP at the next general election after 27 years in parliament. In a statement to the Maidenhead Advertiser, the Maidenhead MP said she wanted to focus on causes close to her heart, including her work on the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.\nMay joins 64 Conservatives and former Conservatives who will not fight their seats at the next election – the highest number of Tories to retire from parliament since May entered the Commons in 1997.\nThe Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said the number of Tories standing down showed there was “no confidence” in Rishi Sunak and the Conservative party’s prospects.\n“This is obviously a very significant decision from Theresa May to stand down at the next election,” she said. “It is a surprise, but of course we’ve heard this from a large number of Conservative sitting MPs. They’ve decided not to stand for the next election, and I think that does reveal that frankly there’s no confidence in Rishi Sunak, nor indeed in the Conservative party to be a party of government for the future.”\nTreasury minister Gareth Davies denied it showed a lack of confidence, saying “This is what happens when you approach a new election, and completely reasonable for people to decide that it’s time to go.”\nIn her statement, May said it had been “an honour and a privilege” to serve as Maidenhead’s MP and vowed to continue working for her constituents until the general election.\n\n Related: Theresa May to step down as MP at general election \n\nShe was first elected as MP for Maidenhead in 1997, and served as home secretary under David Cameron between 2010 and 2016 before succeeding him as prime minister. She coined the term “hostile environment”, which became a catch-all term for controversial policies on illegal migration.\nShe presided over the Home Office when it sent out the notorious “go home” vans, later saying they were “too much of a blunt instrument”. Her three years in Downing Street were marked by sharp parliamentary disagreements about how to implement Brexit – mostly from within her own party – which ultimately led to her resigning and being replaced by Boris Johnson.\n\n Related: The political life of Theresa May – in pictures \n\n\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \n\nLabour’s shadow environment secretary Steve Reed is speaking at the Create Streets Restitch conference in Coventry.\nThe conference is based on “disagreeing well” and Reed said Boris Johnson had started a US-style divide in UK politics. He said Johnson “saw political advantage in creating division”, comparing him to Donald Trump, and pointed out this has continued with leading Conservatives Lee Anderson and Suella Braverman making “very troubling remarks” in recent weeks. Anderson has been stripped of the Tory whip over his Sadiq Khan comments.\nReed added that in the recent past “Labour lost its anchor in the centre and began to drift leftwards”, and said it had been a “fight” to “connect with voters in the centre”. He said this is happening to the Conservatives, who are facing a revival of “right-wing nationalism”. \nReed says in a Labour government his focus as Defra secretary would be to improve access to nature and green space: “Without nature there would be no economy, no health, no food and ultimately no society” and that “people really do care” about their local green areas. \n\n\n\n 9.53am GMT \n\nGB News commissioned People Polling to ask questions of 1,734 people on Thursday in the wake of the budget. The headline figures gave Labour a 46% share of voting intention, with the Conservatives down to 18% and Reform on 13%. It found that “only 47% of 2019 Conservative voters plan to vote Conservative at the next election”.\nYou can find our poll tracker here, where the updated rolling average gives Keir Starmer a 20.3 point lead over Rishi Sunak as we head towards the election. It puts Labour on 44.4% which would translate to something like 455 Labour seats in the next parliament.\n\n Related: UK general election opinion polls tracker: Labour leading as election looms \n\n\n\n\n 9.42am GMT \n\nSpeaking of International Women’s Day, while the Commons is not sitting today, the House of Lords is, and there will be a debate on the steps taken to promote the economic inclusion of women.\nEx-hedge fund manager, Diana Barran, who set up a domestic abuse charity and who is now a life peer, will lead the debate for the government, two days after a Conservative budget arguably failed to help women. The debate starts at 10am. Here’s my colleague Heather Stewart on how Wednesday’s announcements suggest an unattached man would gain £346 from tax cuts, compared with £279 for a woman.\n\n Related: How a Conservative budget failed to help women (again) \n\n\n\n\n 9.22am GMT \n\nLabour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has posted to social media with a video clip for International Women’s Day. She points out that despite the job existing for 800 years, there has never been a female chancellor, and describes it as a “special responsibility” were she to be the first one.\nShe cites Barbara Castle introducing the Equal Pay Act 1970 – the first piece of UK legislation to enshrine the right to pay equality between women and men – but points out the gender pay gap is still 15%.

In her first cabinet, she appoints Boris Johnson as foreign secretary, David Davis as Brexit secretary, and Liam Fox as international trade secretary. \n17 January 2017 Lancaster House May gives her Lancaster House speech outlining her approach to navigating Brexit. It sets out the red lines that will continue to cause difficulties with her own party two years later.\n29 March 2017 Triggers Article 50\n18 April 2017 Snap election Despite having previously ruled it out, May calls a snap general election, accusing opposition parties of trying to jeopardise Brexit preparations.\n8 June 2017 Loses majority After a disastrous campaign performance, May loses her majority in the Commons. She is forced to do a deal with the DUP to get a working majority.\n4 October 2017 Coughing fit May’s speech at the Conservative conference lurches from disaster to disaster, as a cough mars her delivery, a protester manages to hand her a P45, and letters start falling off the backdrop behind her.\n\n\n8 July 2018 Davis and Johnson resign After the Chequers summit, David Davis resigns as Brexit secretary over May’s withdrawal agreement with the EU. Boris Johnson follows Davis out the door the next day, claiming the UK was headed ‘for the status of a colony‘.\n14 November 2018 Withdrawal agreement published The text of the withdrawal agreement is published. It is approved by the EU two weeks later.\n15 November 2018 Raab resigns May loses a second Brexit secretary as Dominic Raab resigns, saying he cannot support the deal he helped negotiate. Work and pensions secretary Esther McVey resigns the same day.\n4 December 2018 Contempt May’s government is found to be in contempt of parliament after refusing to publish the full legal advice it received over Brexit.\n12 December 2018 Confidence vote victory Although more than a third of her MPs vote against her, May survives a Tory vote of no confidence.\n15 January 2019 Record defeat on Brexit deal May suffers the heaviest parliamentary defeat of a British prime minister in the democratic era, losing a meaningful vote on her Brexit withdrawal deal by a majority of 230. \n12 March 2019 Second defeat on Brexit deal May’s deal is again voted down by parliament, this time by a majority of 149.\n27 March 2019 Promises to resign On the day that parliament votes against eight different alternative Brexit options, Theresa May tells her backbench MPs she will stand down as soon as her deal is passed.\n22 May 2019 Leadsom resigns On the eve of European parliamentary elections the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, quits the cabinet.

Pressed on this today, treasury minister Gareth Davies has said it could take “several parliaments” to achieve.\nHe told viewers of Sky News:\n\nThe starting point is that we think there’s a fundamental unfairness that if you work in a job you pay two types of tax, you pay income tax and you pay national insurance contributions.\nSo what we want to do, what we’ve demonstrated at the last two fiscal events, is that we want to get national insurance contributions down to the extent that we remove the unfairness over time.\nThe long-term ambition, it may take several parliaments, but the long-term ambition is to remove that unfairness. We keep all these things under review, but we want to remove the unfairness of having two taxes for those in work.\n\nMy colleague Hilary Osborne had an explainer yesterday on what national insurance is and what it pays for here, if you need a reminder.\n\n\n\n 8.34am GMT \n\nOur picture desk has been quick off the mark with this gallery of pictures from Theresa May’s political career, which includes some images you will surely recognise featuring her being handed a P45, Donald Trump, eating chips and dancing …\n\n Related: The political life of Theresa May – in pictures \n\n\n\n\n 8.29am GMT \n\nAmong the high profile Conservatives stepping down at the next election are Matt Hancock, Sajid Javid, George Eustice, Dominic Raab, Graham Brady, William Cash, Ben Wallace, Alok Sharma, Chris Grayling, Kwasi Kwarteng, Tracey Crouch and Paul Scully. Harriet Harman and Margaret Beckett are perhaps the most prominent Labour MPs standing down, and Caroline Lucas (Green), Mhairi Black and Ian Blackford (SNP) are also very familiar faces from parliament who are not standing again.\n\nUpdated at 8.55am GMT\n\n\n 8.23am GMT \n\nSome of the tributes being paid to Theresa May from fellow MPs this morning include this from Andrew Bowie, Conservative MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, who said:\n\nI’m so sorry to see the woman I was proud to call boss and remain proud to call a friend standing down from Parliament. It will leave the House of Commons a lesser place. Her dedication to her constituency, her country and her Party is unmatched. Thank you Theresa.\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips said: “Something very classy about this [May’s statement] being in the Maidenhead Advertiser first. Love her or loathe Theresa May politics, she was famed for being a responsive and involved local MP.”\nGavin Barwell, former Downing Street chief of staff to May said “Very sorry to hear this – both her constituents and the House of Commons will miss her. I hope future PMs will follow her example of remaining as an MP after they leave Number 10 – she has made a number of important contributions over the last five years.”\n\n\n\n 8.10am GMT \n\nTreasury minister Gareth Davies has denied the number of Conservative MPs stepping down signifies a lack of confidence in the party’s electoral prospects.\nHe told Sky News he was “personally sad” to see Theresa May step down after “a pretty good innings” of “27 years of service not just to her constituents but I think as one of our longest serving home secretaries and then obviously prime minister as well.”\nAsked if the number of Conservative MPs standing down indicated a lack of confidence in the party’s prospects\n\nThis is what happens when you approach a new election, and completely reasonable for people to decide that it’s time to go, particularly when they’ve been in the House of Commons for a long time.\nEach one has made their own decision for personal reasons and I respect every single person’s decision to do so.\n\nDavies then asserted he thought there were nearly 50 Labour MPs who were standing down.

That was down from 26,457 in 2017, when as prime minister she faced challenges from not just Lord Buckethead, but also Bobby Smith, a fathers’ rights activist who got three votes after dressing up as Elmo for the duration of the campaign.\n\n\n\n 7.41am GMT \nAnneliese Dodds: number of Tory MPs standing down signals 'no confidence in Rishi Sunak'\n\nAnneliese Dodds is one of the first Labour politicians to react publicly to the news that Theresa May is to stand down as an MP. She told GB News:\n\nThis is obviously a very significant decision from Theresa May to stand down at the next election.\nIt is a surprise, but of course we’ve heard this from a large number of Conservative sitting MPs. They’ve decided not to stand for the next election, and I think that does reveal that frankly there’s no confidence in Rishi Sunak, nor indeed in the Conservative party to be a party of government for the future.\nI think this really strengthens those calls for change, those calls for a general election.\n\n\n\n\n 7.32am GMT \n\nAlmost 100 MPs have now announced they will not fight their seats at the next election, including more than 60 Conservatives and former Conservatives.\nThis is the most Conservatives to retire from the House of Commons since Theresa May entered it in 1997, which was another election year when polls were suggesting the party faced an electoral wipe-out.\n\n\n\n 7.30am GMT \n\nTheresa May, 67, was first elected as MP for Maidenhead in 1997, and served as home secretary under David Cameron between 2010 and 2016 before succeeding him as prime minister.\nAs home secretary she was one of the chief architects of the so-called “hostile environment” for immigrants, and also presided over the department when it sent out the notorious “go home” vans.\nShe later said the vans were “too much of a blunt instrument”. The scheme’s official evaluation report concluded that only 11 people left the country as a direct result of May’s “go home or face arrest” van advertisements.\nUnder the “hostile environment” private landlords, employers and NHS staff were co-opted into plans to carry out checks on people to ensure they were in the UK legally and to report them to immigration enforcement if not.\n\n\n\n 7.20am GMT \n\nTheresa May has made her announcement that she is stepping down in her local newspaper, the Maidenhead Advertiser. PA Media have an excerpt from the statement:\n\nSince stepping down as prime minister I have enjoyed being a backbencher again and having more time to work for my constituents and champion causes close to my heart including most recently launching a global commission on modern slavery and human trafficking.\nThese causes have been taking an increasing amount of my time.\nBecause of this, after much careful thought and consideration, I have realised that, looking ahead, I would no longer be able to do my job as an MP in the way I believe is right and my constituents deserve.\nAs I pass the baton on I will be working with my successor to secure a Conservative victory in Maidenhead. I remain committed to supporting Rishi Sunak and the government and believe that the Conservatives can win the election.\nI would like to thank all those who chose me to represent them as their MP.\n\n\n\n\n 7.19am GMT \nTheresa May to step down as an MP at the next election\n\nThe former prime minister Theresa May will step down as an MP at the next general election after 27 years in parliament.\nIn a statement to the Maidenhead Advertiser, the Maidenhead MP said she wanted to focus on causes close to her heart, including her work on the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.\nMay, who was first elected in 1997, said: “It has been an honour and a privilege to serve everyone in the Maidenhead constituency as the MP for the last 27 years.\n“Being an MP is about service to one’s constituents and I have always done my best to ensure that I respond to the needs of local people and the local area.”\n\n Related: Theresa May to step down as MP at next general election \n\n\nUpdated at 7.39am GMT\n\n\n 7.18am GMT \nWelcome and opening summary …\n\nGood morning. It is day three of reaction to Jeremy Hunt’s budget on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak’s government is under pressure after floating of the idea that he plans the unfunded axing of national insurance, while the questions for Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves remain what they would do differently, and how they would fund those plans. It is also a day with very little in the diary, but one former PM is making early news with Theresa May’s decision to step down as an MP. Here are the headlines …\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May will step down as an MP at the next general election after 27 years in parliament.\nMichael Gove failed to declare hospitality worth more than £1,700 at three Queens Park Rangers matches over the course of two years, not just the one occasion when he attended with a Conservative donor.\nHaving aimed a jibe at Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner during the budget about multiple home ownership after she faced questions about the sale of her former council house, Hunt has said he will pay more capital gains tax on his own multiple properties.\nSunak has been warned against fighting an election on an unfunded plan to abolish employee national insurance amid projections the move could blow a £40bn hole in the public finances.\n\nThe House of Commons is not sitting today, although the House of Lords is – more on that in a second. None of the Scottish parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland assembly have any business scheduled.\nIt is Martin Belam with you today.

        "content": "The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, told headteachers she would be tempted to punch any Ofsted inspectors who were rude during school visits, earning a rebuke from school unions and Ofsted’s chief inspector. Speaking to the Association of School and College Leaders’ (ASCL) annual conference in Liverpool, Keegan said she had been “delighted” to hear that Ofsted inspectors had been instructed to treat staff in schools with greater respect. “I heard recently from a fantastic school I went into. They told me how their Ofsted experience had gone, and I was shocked, I was actually shocked. I thought, ‘If I’d have met these people I’d have probably punched them.’ They were really rude. “You expect people to be rude when you’re a politician, you sign up for that. But when you are trying to run a school and educate children and change lives, you don’t expect somebody to come in and not be respectful,” Keegan said. Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, when asked about Keegan’s remarks, said: “I think people should act with professionalism, courtesy, empathy and respect on both sides.” The behaviour of Ofsted staff during school inspections in England remains a controversial issue since the death last year of Ruth Perry, a Reading primary school headteacher whose suicide followed an Ofsted inspection that downgraded her school from outstanding to inadequate.   Related: Sunak government does not merit a top performance rating, says Gillian Keegan   Oliver, who became chief inspector in January, said he took Keegan’s remarks to apply to a “previous period” before his appointment. “I’m much more interested in a fresh start and calming down tensions. That’s far better in the interests of children and professionals in the country going forward,” he said. Keegan’s comments attracted stern criticism from Unison, which represents many Ofsted staff. Mike Short, Unison’s head of education, said: “Clearly there’s much that can and should be improved in the way Ofsted inspections are carried out. But to suggest punching people is an appropriate reaction is not becoming of a government minister. “Making light of violence in schools when staff are increasingly likely to face assaults while doing their job is in very poor taste. Ofsted inspectors are already dealing with a great deal of hostility while they work. So much for showing respect.” Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “This is the latest gaffe from a minister who has a potty mouth, an obviously quick temper and still thinks she is doing a – insert expletive – good job. Hardly the qualities we should be instilling in our children.” Keegan’s comments are the latest example of her tendency towards unguarded remarks. Last year, after an interview about school building failures, she was recorded as saying: “Does anyone ever say: ‘You know what, you’ve done a fucking good job, because everyone else has sat on their arse and done nothing.’” During a question-and-answer session at the conference with Pepe Di’Iasio, ASCL’s incoming general secretary, Keegan described Liz Truss’s short-lived premiership as “chaotic” and admitted that the government had failed to resolve the increasing demands for special needs education. “The massive demand, of more and more children diagnosed or even not diagnosed but have special educational needs, that’s something that I think we haven’t got the right system in place,” Keegan said. “If you look at special education needs, we haven’t built enough special educational needs places or schools. We have councils under pressure because families can’t get the right support that they need.” Oliver told the conference that Ofsted was launching a “big listen” over the next three months, canvassing opinions from teachers, parents and organisations about the way schools in England are inspected after Perry’s death. Oliver said Ofsted would change the way inspection reports were displayed on its website to highlight the full range of grades for each aspect of a school, rather than the single overall grade. Labour’s Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “I can’t believe I have to say this, but the education secretary should focus on reforming Ofsted, not on punching working people. An extraordinary comment from a secretary of state painfully out of her depth.”  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "content": " \n\n   default\n  \n\n\nThe next UK general election is looming, with most analysts expecting it to be called late this year.\nAfter 13 years of Conservative rule, Keir Starmer’s Labour has been consistently ahead in the polls since the start of 2022.\nThe latest a general election could be called is January 2025. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has the power to call a general election at any point before then, but facing a potential loss, experts think that he will put it off to stay in power for longer.\nThe Guardian will track latest polling averages, sourced from all major British polling companies, until election day.\n \n\n   default\n  \n\n\nThe Scottish National party (SNP) is not included in the data the Guardian is using in the chart above. In Great Britain-wide polls, the SNP vote sits between 2% and 4% of national vote share. But its geographical concentration in Scotland means it will win many more seats than other small parties with a similar national vote share, such as the Greens. Targeted Scotland-only polls give a much better indication of how well it will do in the next election than the nationwide polls above.\nPolls only go so far in predicting who will win in the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system. What matters is the number of seats each party wins in parliament, which is decided by individual races in 650 constituencies.\n \n\n   default\n  \n\n\nSeat predictions differ, but the one we show above is from the pollster Electoral Calculus. It conducts its own polls, in which it also gathers demographic data from the people it surveys.\nThis data is fed into a mathematical model, called a multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) model, with the goal of estimating the connection between characteristics such as age, gender and the area where a person lives, and which party they will vote for.\nMatching this up with data about what types of people live in different UK constituencies, Electoral Calculus predicts which party will come top in each constituency.\nHow accurate are seat projections?\nIn Britain’s first-past-the-post system the numbers in the polls do not correlate cleanly to seats because it depends where votes are located. Describing seat projections from general polling as a “loose yardstick”, Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, said: “Labour could get a lead of 15 points and not have a majority, a lead of 10 points and have a majority. It depends where those votes are.”\nIf the election is close, the polls become less predictive of the outcome. Other limitations of projecting seat counts from national polling include the fact that the Lib Dem seat count is hard to infer from national polling because, while their national support is much lower than the two main parties, in certain constituencies they have a significant presence. Nor is nationwide polling very informative about what will happen in Scotland, and polls there are more infrequent.\nNotes on the data\nThe chart shows a rolling 10-day average for the support of each party based on Great Britain-wide polls. This excludes Northern Ireland, which has different political parties. On any given day, the Guardian works out the average support for each party across any poll published in the preceding 10 days. Only polling companies that are members of the British Polling Council are included.\nThe seat projections are sourced monthly from Electoral Calculus, which applies a model to polling and demographic data to estimate the number of seats each party may win. They update this projection monthly.\nIllustrations by Sam Kerr"

        "content": "After grand dinners at Chequers, the UK prime ministers’ countryside retreat, Theresa May often used to ask her driver to take her 45 minutes across the Buckinghamshire countryside to her home in Maidenhead, rather than staying overnight. Even as prime minister, May maintained a devotion to her constituency that sometimes baffled aides but encapsulated the contradictions at the heart of one of Britain’s most successful but hard-to-define politicians. And so it was unsurprising that when Britain’s second female prime minister and one of its longest-serving home secretaries announced her retirement from parliament after 27 years, she chose to do so in her local paper. “After much careful thought and consideration, I have realised that, looking ahead, I would no longer be able to do my job as an MP in the way I believe is right and my constituents deserve,” May wrote in the Maidenhead Advertiser. May was prime minister for three years and will be remembered in large part for her decision to call a snap election in 2017 in an attempt to secure a parliamentary majority, only to lose seats and ultimately, her authority over her party. Her turbulent years in Downing Street after that election were plagued by party in-fighting as she tried to find a way to deliver a Brexit agreement that would placate both the hard-right and the centrist factions in her party.   Related: The political life of Theresa May – in pictures   She appeared to have succeeded in 2018, when she secured the backing of her cabinet – ironically at Chequers – for a Brexit deal that would have given Britain continued access to the single market for goods. That began to fall apart within days, however, when David Davis, her Brexit secretary, resigned, closely followed by Boris Johnson, who succeeded her in No 10. May staggered on for almost another year, but stood down after a series of parliamentary defeats on her Brexit deal that confirmed she had lost the support of her party and the Commons as a whole. Some argue that May’s inability to persuade her party to back her Brexit agreement was a result of her awkward style of personal interaction. She disliked the backslapping nature of the Commons tea rooms, hated small talk and deliberately shunned parliamentary gossip. John Crace, the Guardian’s sketch writer, called her the “Maybot”. Those close to her, however, insist that in private she could be warm and sensitive, but that she put up a barrier in public in part to counteract perceptions of weakness as one of Britain’s highest-profile female politicians. Having become involved in Conservative student politics at Oxford, May entered parliament in 1997 as the first ever MP for the newly created seat of Maidenhead. She came to public prominence five years later when as party chair she positioned herself as one of its leading modernisers, warning in her conference speech that the Tories were becoming seen as “the nasty party”. Her position within the party made her a natural ally of David Cameron, who made her home secretary after winning the 2010 election. She held the post for more than six years until succeeding Cameron as party leader, making her the longest-serving home secretary for 60 years and one of very few who have emerged from the department with their political reputation enhanced. As home secretary, May championed a range of initiatives to correct what she saw as social injustices, including curtailing police powers to “stop and search”, spearheading efforts to tackle modern slavery and reversing much of Labour’s hard-line antisocial behaviour policies. Much of that, however, was overshadowed by her uncompromising approach to immigration. She oversaw the “hostile environment” approach to asylum, which attempted to make it as hard as possible for arrivals to secure refugee status. The policy was blamed in part for the Windrush scandal, in which dozens of people who had lived in Britain for decades were wrongly detained and even deported from the UK. She was also blamed for the government’s advertising campaign in which vans drove around London emblazoned with the warning: “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.” The vans were criticised by Labour as racist and even by the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, as “unpleasant”. To her supporters, her hardline stance on immigration coupled with an interest in social justice in other areas, made her the ideal candidate to replace Cameron when he stood down after the Brexit referendum. Although she had championed the remain cause, May was seen as one of the few figures who could unite her fractious party, especially after Johnson’s leadership bid imploded early in the campaign. Her critics, however, say that her lack of a clear ideological programme for government was her undoing. After calling the election in 2017, she watched a commanding poll lead evaporate as she fluctuated between presenting herself as a continuity candidate and a headstrong reformer. The campaign unravelled when she was forced to abandon a controversial signature pledge to reform social care, only to insist as she did so that “nothing has changed”. Unusually for an outgoing prime minister, May remained as an active backbencher for several years after leaving Downing Street, continuing to fight for causes such as combating modern slavery and human trafficking. She told the Maidenhead Advertiser on Friday she wanted to devote her post-political life to those causes. Her decision will be seen in the light of polls showing her party is heading for a landslide defeat at this year’s election. She joins dozens of other Tories also stepping down from their seats before this year’s elections. But where other outgoing Conservative MPs are already looking for lucrative and prominent jobs in the City, May is likely to be one of the few to use her exit from parliament to spend more time in her constituency. Gavin Barwell, her former chief of staff, once said: “I don’t think there has been a prime minister in modern British political history who has been as devoted a constituency MP.”"

        "content": "The former prime minister Theresa May will step down as an MP at the next general election after 27 years in parliament, becoming one of the most high-profile Conservatives to join a wave of departures from the House of Commons. In a statement to the Maidenhead Advertiser, the Maidenhead MP said she wanted to focus on causes close to her heart, including her work on the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. She also criticised the current political climate, saying in an article for the Times that she had “seen a coarsening of our debates and less respect for others’ views”. “Democracy depends on us being able to debate key issues that affect people’s everyday lives seriously and respectfully. It needs politicians who put those they represent first and themselves second. It needs MPs who are there to serve,” she said. The former prime minister also said it was important to remember that “compromise isn’t a dirty word”, highlighting her own unsuccessful efforts to chart a way through the arguments over Brexit from 2017 to 2019.  May, who was first elected in 1997, told her local newspaper: “Since stepping down as prime minister I have enjoyed being a backbencher again and having more time to work for my constituents and champion causes close to my heart including most recently launching a Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. “These causes have been taking an increasing amount of my time. Because of this, after much careful thought and consideration, I have realised that, looking ahead, I would no longer be able to do my job as an MP in the way I believe is right and my constituents deserve.” As polls continue to show Labour with a significant lead over the Conservatives, May joins 64 Conservatives and former Conservatives who will not fight their seats at the next election – the highest number of Tories to retire from parliament since May entered the Commons in 1997. Labour has argued this shows there is “no confidence” in the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the Tory party’s electoral prospects. May, 67, has been a consistent campaigner on modern slavery and human trafficking, and launched her global commission in October, backed by the UK and Bahrain governments. She served as home secretary under David Cameron between 2010 and 2016 before succeeding him as prime minister. Her term in Downing Street lasted a turbulent three years and was dominated by wrangling over Brexit. In a snap election in 2017, she lost her majority but remained in No 10 thanks to a deal with the DUP in the resulting hung parliament. Conservative MPs, opposing her proposed Brexit deal, held a vote of confidence in her leadership. Although she survived, her authority was diminished and she announced her resignation five months later. During her six years as home secretary in Cameron’s cabinet she coined the term “hostile environment”, which became a catch-all expression for controversial policies on illegal migration. In her statement, May said it had been “an honour and a privilege” to serve as Maidenhead’s MP and vowed to continue working for her constituents until the general election, which is expected in the second half of this year. She added: “As I pass the baton on I will be working with my successor to secure a Conservative victory in Maidenhead. I remain committed to supporting Rishi Sunak and the government and believe that the Conservatives can win the election. “I would like to thank all those who chose me to represent them as their member of parliament.” Responding to her announcement, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said on X: “Something very classy about this being in the Maidenhead Advertiser first. Love her or loathe Theresa May politics, she was famed for being a responsive and involved local MP.” The Conservative MP Julian Smith, who served as chief whip under May, said on X: “I am very sorry to see that Theresa May is standing down as an MP. Our second female prime minister is an exceptional public servant with the highest integrity, relentless work ethic & total commitment to all parts of the United Kingdom in addition to her passionate campaigning for vital causes around the world.” Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister under May, said: “On [International Women’s Day] I want to celebrate a colleague who showed us all the importance of hard work, commitment to your constituency and integrity. Parliament will be poorer (and I’m a bit sad – too many women standing down).” Andrew Bowie, May’s former parliamentary private secretary, said: “I’m so sorry to see the woman I was proud to call boss and remain proud to call a friend standing down from parliament. It will leave the House of Commons a lesser place. “Her dedication to her constituency, her country and her party is unmatched. Thank you Theresa.” The Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said the number of Tories standing down showed there was “no confidence” in Sunak and the Conservative party’s prospects. The Treasury minister Gareth Davies denied this was the case, telling Sky News he was “personally sad” to see May stand down, but that it was “completely reasonable” for people to decide to leave parliament before an election. He said: “Each one has made their own decision for personal reasons and I respect every single person’s decision to do so.”"

        "content": "It’s not what anyone would want for a school. As well as educating more than 1,300 children, the teachers at Barclay primary school in Leyton, east London, have been meeting weekly with police to discuss “new evidence of online abuse and criminality”. A bitter row over whether children may wear pro-Palestinian pins, flags and badges on their uniforms prompted a war of words involving parents, with one protester standing outside the school gates with a placard saying: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”. The school even had to close early for the Christmas break amid fears over the wellbeing of staff. “Do not let the misguided actions of a disaffected few be the reason [the children’s education] is disrupted further,” parents were urged in a letter from the Lion Academy Trust. To some, the unsettling events at Barclay school, where pupils aged 3 to 11 are taught in what Ofsted described in 2021 as a “friendly” and “outstanding” setting, will be taken as further evidence that Britain has a problem with extremism. Just as the streets of London are said to have been taken over by protesters threatening “mob rule”, as the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, put it last week, so Barclay school is seen by some as held to ransom by extremists using “malicious misinformation”, as the school has described it. Another viewpoint is that the events at Barclay school highlight what can happen when people feel they are losing their voice. The trouble at the school had started when the parents of children who had dressed up in Palestinian colours at a Children in Need day were sent letters threatening referrals to the government’s anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. They were told not to use their children as “political pawns”. There were then claims, vehemently denied, that an eight-year-old from a Palestinian family had been “bullied” by staff for refusing to remove a Palestine flag patch from his uniform.   Related: A dark pattern runs through British politics: when the powerful lose control, protesters suffer | Owen Jones   The fact that the school had written to parents in February 2022 to express horror at the events that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to encourage fundraising for humanitarian relief, drew claims of double standards. But, perhaps more importantly for some parents, events were unfolding in a context where ministers have been making headlines by condemning the pro-Palestine “hate marches”, and most recently condemning “mob rule”. “The school essentially just made policy up to clamp down [on] pro-Palestinian sentiment of any description,” said one parent, an NHS surgeon who has three children at Barclay primary. “It’s completely from the top. People at Barclay have been allowed to get away with it because it’s endorsed by the UK government.” Last Friday evening, Sunak made a hastily arranged speech on the steps of Downing Street – an unusual event that signalled gravity and urgency. “In recent weeks and months, we have seen a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality,” the prime minister declared. “What started as protests on our streets has descended into intimidation, threats and planned acts of violence.” The comments may have been motivated by death threats against MPs and the recent chaos in parliament over a vote on Gaza – but it was those demonstrating in support of Palestinians under Israeli bombardment that were clearly on his mind. “Don’t let the extremists hijack your marches,” Sunak said. The intervention seemed to go down well among Conservative backbenchers, and some asked why it had taken so long for the prime minister to speak out. Elsewhere, however, it appears to have prompted a different set of questions. Is Britain really in the grip of extremists who are “trying to tear us apart”, as the prime minister suggested? Or, instead, is there an attempt to silence certain voices through false conflations of extremism and passionate protest, leading Britain down a dangerous road? Dame Sara Khan, who was the government’s counter-extremism commissioner and is now carrying out a social cohesion and democratic resilience review for the communities secretary, Michael Gove, is in full agreement with the prime minister that Britain has an extremism problem – but it is nothing new, she suggested.   Related: No 10 faces Tory backlash over plans to broaden extremism definition   There was a 2013 government extremism taskforce and a 2015 counter-extremism strategy. Then Khan’s 2021 report, Operating with Impunity, made further calls for action, lamenting the gaps in legislation that allowed neo-Nazi organisations such as Combat 18 to exist and the Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary to allegedly “motivate at least 70-100 people to turn to terrorism”. He was eventually convicted in 2016 for the terror offence of inviting support for the terrorist group Daesh. But, Khan said, it was vital to be clear about what the government wanted to target – a clarity that was missing in some of the commentary, she suggested. “I think it’s really important that we don’t conflate those protesters, somehow saying or portraying them as somehow as being all extremists,” she told the Guardian. “What I’ve been really uncomfortable with over the last couple of weeks is the kind of argument that they’re all Islamist extremists on these demonstrations. I think that’s actually outrageous. Some are not even pro-Palestinian people, just anti-war. There are clearly Jewish people there, there’s a whole range of people there, and to try to frame these demonstrations as Islamist extremism is completely far-fetched and untrue.” She went on: “It’s about precision of language. If you are not concise about it, you’re just going to further anger people, if you are not listening to what people are saying.” Claims of rampant criminality at the demonstrations, often attended by hundreds of thousands of people, also appear to be at odds with the facts on the ground. At the last pro-Palestine march in London there were just 12 arrests. This compares with 36 arrests at the Glastonbury music festival in 2023. According to the Metropolitan police, of the 238 arrests made by police at pro-Palestine protests between October and December last year, only 35 have been charged, while three penalty notices and four cautions were also issued. Jude Lanchin, a solicitor for Bindmans who has represented 23 people arrested at the protests, said that many of the cases were “questionable and not based on sufficient reasonable suspicion that an offence has actually been committed”. “Out of 23 cases from October to date, only two of my clients have been charged,” she said. “A number have had the investigation dropped and others are subject to unreasonably long bail periods, although charges are unlikely to be brought. Other clients have been threatened with arrest when their actions clearly do not constitute a criminal offence.” Sunak had suggested in his Downing Street speech that a dearth of arrests of those at pro-Palestine protests may be due to a lack of rigour by the police. The Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley this week responded that “to suggest that we are not where the law permits, as the law allows, policing robustly is not accurate”. The perception of some that the government is seeking to make political capital out of the crisis in Gaza, by drawing dividing lines between those who support the “extremists” offering support for Palestinians, and the rest, has been strengthened by the fact that ministers are expected next week to announce a new definition of extremism, determining the organisations that Whitehall will be prohibited from engaging with. According to leaked drafts, it will include groups active in “the promotion or advancement of an ideology based on intolerance, hatred or violence that aims to undermine the rights or freedoms of others”, including “those who seek to undermine or overturn the UK’s liberal system of democracy and democratic rights”. It is not a move that Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said he was comfortable with.   Related: Rish! purposefully grips his lectern – but shows he has no grip of the country    “If you say a touchstone of British values is, for example, tolerance towards gay people then you end up saying that people who are religiously committed to saying that homosexuality is a sin are extremists,” he said. “Then you end up creating a situation in which the UK’s … famously pluralist tolerance towards different belief systems is not tolerant towards that belief system. So it’s really hard to try and work out what are the touchstones for British values.” Among the organisations that the government has suggested will remain in the cold is the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Links were first suspended in 2009 in a row over comments by one its leaders about Gaza. But why aren’t conversations happening now, the organisation asks. “How can we move past things if you’re not talking to us?” asked Zara Mohammed, who was appointed as the MCB’s first female secretary general three years ago. “I’m a new secretary general, we’re in 2024. What is the issue now? We are the largest and most diverse represented body in the country. Who are you talking to when it comes to Muslims?” Back at Barclay school, tensions remain high. “There has been no ‘heavy handedness’ towards any religious, cultural or ethnic sector of the broad and diverse community we serve,” a spokesperson for the school said. “The very vast majority of parents are happy to comply with the school’s uniform policy – and only a tiny minority of adults who sought to exploit Children in Need for their political views have caused this disruption.” Some of the 200 protesting parents have said they are considering taking her children out of the school. Sunak’s comments on the steps of Downing Street had only confirmed to some, they said, that they were not to be permitted a voice. Sir David Ormand, a former director of GCHQ, the UK’s intelligence, security and cyber agency, who was a key player in designing Britain’s counter-extremism and terrorism strategies in the 2000s, said upset and angst was the goal of the enemies of a multicultural Britain. “The acid test of Sunak’s statement is, do people now feel less angry?” Ormand said. “Do the people, the communities concerned, feel less frightened [after his speech] and are we all less cynical that the public interest is being sacrificed to party management interests? The answer is probably [he is] failing on all three.”"

No 10 refused to say what advice officials had given her and whether she actually followed it, but insisted she had “acted in line with established precedent”. Kate Sang, a professor at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, sued Donelan for libel after the minister published a letter to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) in October urging it to cut links with her and another academic, Dr Kamna Patel of University College London. Donelan expressed her “disgust and outrage” at their appointment to an expert advisory group to Research England on equality, diversity and inclusion.

My statement on recent correspondence relating to Research England’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Expert Advisory Group. pic.twitter.com/Fn3xRdwjxX— Michelle Donelan MP (@michelledonelan) March 5, 2024  Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said on Thursday that the prime minister backed the cabinet minister, as Donelan faced calls to resign. Speaking on a visit to South Yorkshire, Sunak told broadcasters he had been “focused on the budget” when asked why Donelan was still in post. He said it was a “longstanding convention stretching back many years that the government will fund those legal disputes when it relates to government ministers doing their work”. Outlining the advice Donelan received, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “I can’t obviously comment on specific legal advice. But as I say, and as the DSIT statement said, she received advice and was, in line with established precedent, provided legal support and representation.” When asked whether it was acceptable for people to make false claims and wait for a long investigation to take place before retracting them, the spokesperson said: “There was an independent investigation. And at the conclusion of that, the secretary of state was clear that she fully accepted that the individual was not an extremist, a supporter of Hamas or any other proscribed organisation, and she therefore withdrew her concerns and deleted her original post.” On Thursday evening it was reported that Donelan’s letter was cleared by her department’s legal team. Politico said civil servants had flagged concerns during the drafting of the letter – to which numerous people, including top officials, contributed – but that the legal team had decided the position was solid. An investigation by UKRI clearedSang and Patel of the allegations. The leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, also defended Donelan, telling MPs the minister was of good character because she returned a redundancy payment from her brief time as education secretary in the final days of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Labour has criticised the decision to make UK taxpayers foot the £15,000 bill as a “new low for standards” and “totally insulting”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “I think most people watching this will be aghast. The government is telling them every day that they can’t do any more to help them. “People are really struggling to pay their bills, and the government says: ‘We can’t afford to help you any more.’ People know that public services are crumbling. “And then you’ve got a minister who says something she shouldn’t have said, then has to pick up a legal action and pay damages and costs, and then says: ‘The taxpayer is going to pay for that.’” DSIT confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that the sum was paid “without admitting any liability”. The shadow leader of the Commons, Lucy Powell, asked whether Donelan had followed “appropriate advice” that was given to her, or had gone against it. “Because if [she went against it], then surely she should personally pay the costs,” Powell told MPs. She also urged Donelan to make a statement in the Commons outlining what happened. “If the money was paid by taxpayers because it related to her ministerial responsibilities, then she must come to parliament as a minister and account for that.” The Liberal Democrats have called for an investigation by the government’s ethics adviser into DSIT covering Donelan’s legal costs."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been warned against fighting an election on an unfunded plan to abolish employee national insurance amid projections the move could blow a £40bn hole in the public finances. As the pre-election battle on the economy between the Conservatives and Labour intensified, the prime minister was on Thursday under mounting pressure to explain how the measure could be afforded while public services were crumbling.   Related: The Guardian view on national insurance: these taxes embody a solidarity we still need | Editorial   After placing a 2p national insurance cut at the centre of Wednesday’s budget – funded through higher government borrowing, stealth tax rises and a squeeze on public spending to come after polling day – his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the Tories’ ambition was to scrap the tax on workers entirely. The modest scale of the giveaways in the budget has made a snap election less likely, although Sunak refused to rule out the possibility in interviews after the budget.  Interactive  The country’s leading economists questioned how abolishing employee national insurance contributions (NICs) could be afforded without further dismantling already stretched public services, and while the next parliament was on track to be the toughest for more than 80 years for a chancellor wanting to bring debt down. In scathing remarks for the government, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, described the pledge as “not worth the paper it’s written on unless accompanied by some sense of how it will be afforded.” The measure would cost more than £40bn a year in forgone revenue for the exchequer, he said, as the most expensive item in a list of unfunded Tory promises, including a promise reiterated in Wednesday’s budget to increase defence spending by £10bn. The government has also refused to spell out in detail its plans for public spending after the election, beyond saying it would push for an efficiency drive alongside a 1% real-terms funding increase for Whitehall departments – a level the IFS said implied cuts of about £20bn for non-ringfenced areas outside health, education and defence. Sunak declined on Thursday to say how the plan might be funded, telling broadcasters instead: “I think what people can see from me, I think they trust me on these things, is that I will always do this responsibly.” The prime minister’s spokesperson also declined to say whether the government was considering forgoing the entire revenue from national insurance, or whether it was considering getting rid of national insurance by merging it with income tax, which might result in income tax having to rise. The IFS included Labour in its broadside against the pre-election tax and spending plans being floated by both political parties. “The government and opposition are joining in a conspiracy of silence in not acknowledging the scale of the choices and trade-offs that will face us after the election,” Johnson said. “They, and we, could be in for a rude awakening when those choices become unavoidable.” Labour tried to deflect criticism of its own plans by turning up the pressure on the prime minister and the chancellor, saying their ambition on national insurance would come with a higher price tag than Liz Truss’ ill-fated £45bn mini budget package. It said the plan would cost £46bn a year, equivalent to £230bn over the course of a five-year parliament. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said in a letter to the prime minister: “Just like Liz Truss, you have so far refused to set out how you are going to pay for this latest shake of the magic money tree.”  Interactive  Casting its verdict on the chancellor’s budget, the IFS said there were billions of pounds worth of unanswered questions in the Conservatives’ tax and spending plans, including how the party would find vast savings from Hunt’s new public sector productivity drive after more than a decade of austerity. Despite cutting employees’ national insurance by a third in the budget and in November’s autumn statement, from 12% to 8% of earnings, it warned Britain remained stuck in a situation where the overall tax take would reach the highest level since 1948 and still not make a meaningful dent in bringing down the national debt.  Interactive  Amid almost two decades of falling real wages, Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said household disposable incomes, after adjusting for inflation, were poised to fall by 0.9% between 2019 and the end of 2024 – “the first parliament in modern history to see a fall in living standards”. Pensioners and high earners were the biggest losers, Bell said. The idea that tax cuts could be afforded at a time when public services were faltering was a “fiscal fiction”, he added.  Interactive    Related: Jeremy Hunt’s last budget before an election – but not his last roll of the dice   Hunt defended his budget, saying he wanted to “make a start” in cutting taxes to boost households’ living standards, although he admitted: “I’ve never said for one moment that I can bring them right down all in one go.” The IFS said that by accepting the 2p budget cut in national insurance that Labour would “make life more difficult for itself” to balance the books, having lost £10bn that could have otherwise been spent on public services. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, suggested Labour could find savings from elsewhere to fund its spending plans. The party had planned to use money raised from abolishing the non-dom tax regime and an extension in the energy windfall tax for a number of schemes designed to elevate its spending above Tory proposals, including opening breakfast clubs in all primary schools and funding more out-of-hours doctors and dentist appointments. However Hunt himself raised those taxes on Wednesday and used them to pay for cuts to national insurance, which Labour is backing. Reeves told the BBC on Thursday: “We will identify the savings we can make to fund this.” Labour officials said Reeves’ team is finalising the details of what they will cut, and plan to make an announcement imminently. Johnson said it would not be difficult for Labour to find the money to replace the £4bn a year the Tories had raised through changes in the non-dom rules and energy taxes, which were now earmarked for tax cuts. However, Reeves’ promise to match the Tories’ tax cutting plans while pushing for savings from existing budgets sparked anger from some on the Labour left. Kate Dove, the co-chair of the leftwing Momentum campaign group, said: “It is absolutely shameful that the Labour leadership appears to be committing to further austerity in government.”"

        "content": "  6.02pm GMT   We are closing this blog now but you can read all our UK politics coverage here.      5.34pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Rishi Sunak has refused to say how the Conservatives might fund their long-term proposal to abolish national insurance contributions for employees. (See 3.02pm.) Keir Starmer says this amounts to a commitment to a £46bn unfunded tax cut and that in floating the idea Sunak is repeating the same error made by Liz Truss in her mini-budget. (See 11.34am.)   Jeremy Hunt and Rachel Reeves are joined in a “conspiracy of silence” over tens of billions of pounds in tough tax and spending choices, with the next government likely to inherit the toughest outlook for the public finances in 80 years, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said.   Household incomes are on course to fall for the first time over the course of a parliament despite Jeremy Hunt’s national insurance cuts, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has said.   Jeremy Hunt has promised to voluntarily pay more capital gains tax on his properties so that he does not benefit from a tax cut he introduced.   Political parties accepted £93m in donations last year, boosted by new Conservative and Labour mega-donors, with the 2024 election on course to be the highest-spending contest ever.   Grassroots Conservative supporters have lashed out at Jeremy Hunt’s budget as offering “nothing for working people” and “making things better for the rich”.      5.18pm GMT  Royal College of GPs says funding for GP surgeries in England for year ahead 'derisory'  Family doctors’ leaders have criticised ministers for giving GP surgeries in England a “derisory” increase in their funding, despite surgeries seeing record numbers of patients. The Royal College of GPs (RCGP) has warned that the 1.9% rise in the budget for general practice for 2024/25 will leave hard-pressed GPs struggling to provide the care that patients expect. In a sharply-worded letter to Victoria Atkins, the health and social care secretary, Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the RCGP’s chair, claims that GP services are being “allowed to crumble”. In her letter she protested that the 1.9% rise “amounts to a real terms funding cut when compared to CPI inflation, which will make it even harder for GPs to deliver the care our patients need at a time when general practice is already in crisis”. She added:  This derisory funding plan for general practice will have real-life consequences for the profession, the service we provide and, most importantly, for our patients.  Hawthorne claimed that the settlement “is sadly part of an ongoing trend of neglecting primary care” and that “the service as a whole remains starved of funding” by ministers and NHS England. GPs are busier than ever, saw 7% more patients in December than in December 2019 and have delivered on the government’s 2019 pledge to increase the number of appointments by 50m a year – even though the number of fully-qualified family doctors has fallen, she added. While the amount of money going into GP care is rising, the proportion of the overall NHS budget it receives fell to 8.4% this year – the smallest share for eight years, Hawthorne said. GP services were given £9.182bn for this financial year but under their new contract will get £9.356bn in the new one starting next month, just £178m (1.9%) more, the RCGP said. However, Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS England’s national director for primary care and community services, told all GP practices in England in a recent letter that GPs would receive much more next year – £11.864bn overall, an increase of £259m. The RCGP say the discrepancy between the figures is because NHS England includes in the headline total figure they cite certain payments that it regards as outwith the central GP contract. In January the Liberal Democrats published an analysis showing that GP funding has fallen by £350m a year in real terms since 2019. Responding to Hawthorne’s letter, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson did not respond directly to her complaint about underfunding. But they said:  GPs and their teams are at the heart of our communities, and we hugely value their vital work. This contract will reduce unnecessary and burdensome bureaucracy so they can spend more valuable time with their patients, while also giving them greater autonomy to run local practices.      5.10pm GMT  IMF says tax rises likely to be needed in Britain in future  Stabilising the UK’s debt is likely to require additional tax rises, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. As PA Media reports, speaking at the IMF’s regular press briefing on Thursday, director of communications Julie Kozak told reporters:   IMF staff will be analysing the announced policies in greater detail but the aim to continue the fiscal consolidation pursued since 2022 to reduce inflation and stabilise debt is welcome.  Kozak said that the national insurance cut and reform of the child benefit system had been funded by “well-conceived revenue-raising measures”. She added:  Significant spending to protect service delivery, growth-enhancing investment and the appropriate commitment to stabilise debt are likely to require additional revenue-raising measures in the medium term.      5.02pm GMT  Cameron says in Berlin there's 'incredible unity between allies'  when asked about German leak about British troops  David Cameron said there was “incredible unity between allies” when asked about a leaked call between German military officials about Ukraine which included details of UK operations, PA Media reports. PA says:  The foreign secretary’s visit to Berlin today came just days after Russia intercepted a telephone conversation in which officials were heard suggesting British service personnel were on the ground in Ukraine. He was asked at a press conference alongside his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock whether he agreed with Berlin’s assessment that trust among allies was unbroken. Cameron said: “I don’t want to play into the hands of some Russian narrative about divisions between allies. What I see … is incredible unity between allies, incredible unity in Nato. “Of course, we’re going to have areas where we want to discuss what more we can do, what more we can help. And those are the sorts of discussions that good friends and allies with this unity have in private.” His visit also came as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faced continued pressure from Western allies and politicians in Berlin to supply Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles. Scholz has been unwilling to send the Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv on the grounds that German soldiers would have to be sent to Ukraine to help operate them, dragging Germany into war with Russia. Asked whether the UK is pushing Berlin to send its Taurus missiles, Lord Cameron said “it was a matter for the German government to decide” and that he could “only speak for Britain’s experience of how effective these weapons have been at helping Ukraine to fight off this illegal aggression”. Peace will be achieved “through strength,” he said. “You get peace by demonstrating that Putin cannot win, you get peace by helping the Ukrainians deliver what they need on the battlefield.” He also downplayed concerns about a possible escalation of the conflict. “At every stage it’s been said ‘if you give anti-tank weapons to the Ukraine, that’s escalation’. No, it wasn’t. “‘If you give tanks to the Ukrainians, that’s escalation’. No, it wasn’t. ‘If you give long-range artillery or long-range fires to the Ukrainians, it’s escalation’. No, it isn’t. “I think the reason for that is clear. If what you’re doing is helping a country defend itself from illegal and completely unjustified aggression, then there should be nothing to stop you helping that country to fight back to recover its territory. “As long as we’re not in a situation where a Nato soldier is killing a Russian soldier, we are not causing escalation. We’re allowing Ukraine to defend itself.”   Updated at 5.03pm GMT    4.26pm GMT   The government has said that Michelle Donelan, the science secretary, received official legal advice about the message she posted on X that led to her department paying damages to an academic.

But the number who have arrived so far this year is higher than it was at the same point last year, Labour says. In a news release, Labour says:  225 individuals were confirmed to have crossed the Channel on Wednesday 6 March on five boats, taking the total for the year so far up to 3,208. That exceeds the 3,150 that had arrived by the same point last year, and is almost 45% more than the 2,212 that had arrived by 6 March 2022, which went on to become the record year for small boat arrivals … The number of individuals rescued in the Channel by the French authorities and returned to the French coast is also at a record high for this point of the year. Up to 6 March, at least 868 migrants had been rescued in French waters, compared to 490 over the same period in 2023 and 463 in 2022. That means the total number of people who have tried to cross the Channel so far this year is over 4,075, way in excess of the numbers in any previous year.  Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said these figures undermined Rishi Sunak’s claim that his plan to stop small boats is working. Kinnock said:  In January, Rishi Sunak and James Cleverly told us that small boat arrivals were down by a third, they said their plan was working, and they insisted that the reduction in crossings last year was nothing to do with the weather. All those claims now look utterly ridiculous, and even worse, their complacency has left our country dangerously exposed and ill-prepared for what continues to be a record start to the year for small boat crossings.

In an interview for broadcasters, asked about this, he said:  I think what people can see from me, I think they trust me on these things, is that I will always do this responsibly. We funded our current tax cuts responsibly, borrowing hasn’t increased, we are still on track to meet our fiscal rules that have our debt falling.  At the No 10 lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson also declined to say how the government might fund this proposal. And he refused to say whether the government was considering forgoing the entire £46bn it gets from national insurance, or whether it was considering getting rid of national insurance by merging it with income tax, which might result in income tax having to rise. In an interview this morning Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said one option would be to merge income tax and national insurance.  Updated at 3.09pm GMT    2.39pm GMT  Sunak would be 'absolutely nuts' to hold general election in May, says George Osborne  Rishi Sunak would be “absolutely nuts” to call a general election in May, the former Tory chancellor George Osborne has said. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with Ed Balls, Osborne said that No 10 has thought about having a May election. A lot of Tory MP were in favour of the idea “because they think things will only get worse”, he said. But Osborne said he personally thought going early would be a mistake.  The centre has thought about a May election but I think it would be absolutely nuts. They are 26 points behind in the opinion polls. You do not call a general election when you’re 26 points behind and you still have nine months left of your mandate to run.  If I was Sunak, I wouldn’t be ruling out an election in January 2025. You want to give yourself maximum room for manoeuvre.      1.58pm GMT  Energy minister Andrew Bowie won't have to resign despite criticising windfall tax extension, No 10 confirms  Andrew Bowie, the energy minister, is not being sacked despite posting a message on X yesterday saying the extension of the windfall tax on energy companies was “deeply disturbing”. In normal circumstances a minister who criticised government policy in public in this way would be expected to resign. But, at the No 10 lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson said that Rishi Sunak retained confidence in Bowie. The spokesperson said:  [Bowie has] obviously has since clarified his position, he’s spoken to the chancellor about his views and he’s been clear that he supports the budget.  The spokesperson was referring to this post on X put out by Bowie last night.  I've spoken to the Chancellor. He understands the importance of the EPL issue in the North East.The fact is only the Conservatives support our Oil and Gas sector. Thats why, for example, we are alone in retaining the capital gains allowances. So now we need get on and deliver.— Andrew Bowie MP (@AndrewBowie_MP) March 6, 2024   I’ve spoken to the Chancellor. He understands the importance of the EPL [energy profits levy] issue in the North East.The fact is only the Conservatives support our Oil and Gas sector. Thats why, for example, we are alone in retaining the capital gains allowances. So now we need get on and deliver.  Bowie seems to have been allowed some leeway to speak out because he is MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine in the north-east of Scotland, where there are strong concerns that an extension of the windfall tax might jeopardise jobs in the oil and gas industries. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, has said that he will not vote for this policy when the Commons has to approve the budget. Labour has said Bowie should have to resign over this.  Updated at 1.59pm GMT    1.38pm GMT       1.36pm GMT  Labour's Anas Sarwar criticises SNP's health record during FMQs at Holyrood  The Scottish National party government in Edinburgh is under further attack by its critics who accuse ministers of passing performative acts of parliament which they then fail to properly pay for, this time over NHS waiting lists.  Last month the housing charity Shelter Scotland accused Humza Yousaf, the first minister, of “gaslighting” voters by introducing progressive-seeming legal rights to housing but then cutting the funding councils needed to deliver them. Scottish homelessness rates hit record levels last year, despite a legal guarantee to housing. At first minister’s questions earlier today Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said that under another Scottish law, this time the Patient Rights (Treatment Time Guarantee) (Scotland) Regulations 2012, Yousaf and his colleagues had technically broken that law 680,000 times because 680,000 patients had not had treatment within the 12-week target specified. Listing every recent health secretary, Sarwar said:  Humza Yousaf might try and blame the pandemic, but this law was broken over 320,000 times before covid. Shona Robison broke the law 158,000 times. Michael Matheson broke the law 184,000 times. And Humza Yousaf broke the law 235,000 times. And since he published his so-called NHS recovery plan, the SNP have broken the law 306,735 times.   Yousaf protested that the pandemic had hit every health service, and repeated his apology to any patient who was not seen or treated in time.  But this theme will reoccur in the run-up to the general election: the SNP’s opponents plan to make the contest in Scotland in large part a referendum on the SNP’s record in government, even though it is not actually up for re-election.     1.22pm GMT  Sunak defends taxpayer funding Michelle Donelan's libel settlement, on grounds dispute related to her doing her job  Rishi Sunak had defended the use of taxpayers’ money to make a payment of £15,000 for damages to an academic libelled by Michelle Donelan, the science secretary. The prime minister claimed that it was right for the government to cover the cost to the damages because the legal dispute arose as a result of Donelan doing her job. But Keir Starmer has described this as “totally insulting”, and insisted that as prime minister he would never authorise a payment of this kind. In October last year Donelan suggested that Prof Kate Sang, of Heriot-Watt university in Edinburgh was a support of Hamas. She made the suggestion in a letter to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), posted on X, saying it should cut links with Sang. On Tuesday Donelan retracted her suggestion, and it was subsequently revealed that her department has paid £15,000 in damages. Asked to explain why the taxpayer should pay for the minister’s mistake, Sunak told broadcasters today:  Obviously you will understand I’ve been focused on the Budget, but my understanding of this is that Michelle raised some concerns about some articles that had been shared talking about what happened on October 7. I think subsequently to that, those thoughts I think have been clarified and Michelle has withdrawn those concerns. With regard to the settlement, it is a long-standing convention stretching back many years, over different governments of all different parties, including Labour, that the government will fund those legal disputes when it relates to government ministers doing their work.  But Starmer said that getting the taxpayer to pay for a libel committed by a minister should not be allowed. In a separate clip for broadcasters, he said:  I think most people watching this will be aghast. The government is telling them every day that they can’t do any more to help them. People are really struggling to pay their bills, and the government says ‘We can’t afford to help you anymore’. People know that public services are crumbling. And then you’ve got a minister who says something she shouldn’t have said, then has to pick up a legal action and pay damages and costs, and then says ‘The taxpayer is going to pay for that’. Totally insulting. We need a change. I’ll tell you something else – if we’re privileged enough to come into power and have a Labour government, we will never allow that sort of thing to happen. That will be history.  During business questions in the Commons, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the house, defended Donelan on the grounds that she did not take a severance payment after she resigned as eductation secretary in 2022, even though she was entitled to one. Mordaunt said:  When [Donelan] was entitled to redundancy payments from being a secretary of state, which was £16,000, she did not take that and handed it back to the department, because it was the right thing to do. I would just remind people of that and I think that speaks volumes about her character and how much she values the fact that it is taxpayers’ money that we are talking about.  Mordaunt did not remind MPs that Donelan only spent about 36 hours as education secretary. She was appointed by Boris Johnson, as his government was falling apart, but quickly decided she did not want to serve under him. Government sources have suggested that one reason why the department felt obliged to fund the settlement is that Donelan received official legal advice about her letter, and her tweet, before it was published.  Updated at 1.27pm GMT    12.47pm GMT  Sunak declines to restate claim that his working assumption is general election to be held in second half of 2024  In an interview with Sky News last night Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, played down the prospects of the election being held in May. Asked if the budget was “the last throw of the dice” before the election, he replied: “Absolutely not.” Asked if the government was still planning for an autumn election, he said that was still “the working assumption” (which is what Rishi Sunak himself said in January), but he stressed that the timing of the election was a matter for the PM. Sunak himself was interviewed by Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 within the last hour, and, when asked about the timing of the election, he chose not to repeat the line about autumn being the “working assumption”. When Vine put it to him that there are reports saying he is considering an election in May, Sunak laughed, and said he would not be saying anything about that.  Asked if he still favoured holding it in the second half of the year, Sunak just said that what mattered was the choice facing voters.     12.31pm GMT  Hunt's proposal to abolish national insurance 'not worth paper its written on', IFS suggests  The Institute for Fiscal Studies always finds at least some aspects of a budget to criticise, but its verdict on yesterday’s is a lot more withering than usual. Here are the main points from the summary of its position from Paul Johnson, the IFS’s director. Johnson delivered this at a news conference this morning.  Johnson suggested the proposal to abolish national insurance from Jeremy Hunt was “not worth the paper its written on”. He explained:   Talk of abolishing national insurance does not look realistic. Of course, the chancellor is only talking about the part paid by employees (and the self-employed) not the much bigger part paid by employers. But this pledge to cut taxes by more than £40bn goes in the same bucket as pledges to increase defence spending – not worth the paper its written on unless accompanied by some sense of how it will be afforded.    He said taxes were likely to remain high as a proportion of national income for decades to come. He said:   I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Tax has risen to a higher fraction of national income than it has ever been in my lifetime, and I don’t expect it to return to its previous level for the rest of my lifetime.   Johnson is 57. This chart from the OBR’s report yesterday shows how tax as a proportion of GDP has risen during Johnson’s lifetime.  He said the debt problem facing the next government will be worse than for any other government since the end of the second world war. He said:   The combination of high debt interest payments and low forecast nominal growth means that the next parliament could well prove to be the most difficult of any in 80 years for a chancellor wanting to bring debt down. Even stabilising debt as a fraction of national income is likely to mean some eye wateringly tough choices – and we are talking tens of billions of pounds worth of tough choices – on tax and spending.   He said the budget showed the government is not genuinely committed to raising defence spending. He said:   Remarkably [Jeremy] Hunt stuck with the claim that he wants defence spending to rise to 2.5% of national income “as soon as economic conditional allow”. Well, economic conditions allowed a £10 billion cut in NICs this year. So they could have allowed a £10 billion increase in defence spending instead. That would have just about met the target. Actions speak louder than words.   He said Hunt had only been able to present a budget in line with his fiscal rules by making “unlikely” or “undesirable” assumptions about spending. He said:   On his figures, debt is rising slowly to 2027-28 before falling by a minuscule amount as a share of national income in the following year. But that requires him to assume a whole series of unlikely, or undesirable things.  Perhaps unlikeliest of all is that the supposedly temporary one-year 5p cut on fuel duty originally put in place in April 2022 will expire in a year’s time, and that rates of fuel duties will then rise in line with inflation, despite freezing them yesterday for the 15th year in a row. Perhaps least desirable is that investment spending will fall by £18bn a year in real terms. Somewhere between the two lies the effective promise that day-to-day spending on a range of public services outside of health, defence and education, will fall by something like £20bn. Maybe that is possible, but keeping to these plans would require some staggeringly hard choices which the government has not been willing to lay out. Indeed, we heard yesterday that the next spending review, in which these choices will have to be announced, will rather conveniently not happen until after the election. One only has to look at the scale of NHS waiting lists, the number of local authorities at or near bankruptcy, the backlogs in the justice system, the long-term cuts to university funding, the struggles of the social care system, to wonder where these cuts will really, credibly come from.   He said the Conservatives and Labour were both refusing to accept how severe the spending cuts planned for after the election are. He said:   If I am sceptical about Mr Hunt’s ability to stick to his current spending plans, I am at least that sceptical that Rachel Reeves will preside over deep cuts in public service spending … Government and opposition are joining in a conspiracy of silence in not acknowledging the scale of the choices and trade-offs that will face us after the election. They, and we, could be in for a rude awakening when those choices become unavoidable.    He said higher rate tax payers could gain up to £1,500, and people on average earnings up to £1,000 a year, from the reductions in national insurance in the budget and last year’s autumn statement.   He said pensioners would be “substantial net losers” from the budget. Confirming an assessment made by the Resolution Foundation (see 10.24am), Johnson said:   While many workers will be better off as a result of tax changes over this parliament, pensioners will be substantial net losers. Well over 60 per cent of pensioners now pay income tax. Income tax changes will leave most of them £650 a year worse off by 2027, and over £3,000 a year worse off if they are higher rate tax payers.   He said “average household incomes this autumn are likely to be lower than they were in autumn 2019”.  Richard Partington has more on the IFS’s analysis here.   Related: IFS warns of Labour and Tory ‘conspiracy of silence’ over future tax and spending plans       11.48am GMT  Electoral Commission records show Hunt has now donated £123,000 to Tory association in his constituency  Jeremy Hunt has donated more money to his constituency Conservative party in the last four months to boost his chances of re-election, according to fresh official records. The chancellor donated an extra £18,084 last November, Electoral Commission records show, pushing the total number of cash he has spent since the last general election, to £123,345. Earlier this week the Guardian revealed he had given £105,261 to the south west Surrey Conservative association over the last five years, from the last general election held in December 2019 until June 2023. The most recent accounts for Hunt’s local association have warned that its “balance sheet is at a less than satisfactory level”. A note stated that members’ annual subscriptions were due to increase this year. Hunt’s Godalming and Ash seat is a key target for the Liberal Democrats. Polling by Savanta shows the Lib dems are on course to take the “blue wall” constituency, which would make Hunt the first chancellor in modern times to lose his seat in the Commons. Over the last week, Hunt has repeatedly insisted he hopes he will “carry on serving” his voters, and noted: “I hope to be the chancellor after the election”. When asked whether he spent £105k from February 2021 to June 2023 over fears of losing his seat, Hunt told Sky News yesterday:   I put that money in mainly because during the pandemic it was not possible to do fundraising in the normal way. I’ve got a brilliant team in my constituency and we do some fantastic local campaigning and I wanted that to continue despite the fact that we couldn’t fundraise. But have I (got) a tough fight against the Lib Dems? Absolutely. And I’ve never taken that for granted.      11.34am GMT  Starmer says Hunt repeating Liz Truss's budget error with £46bn unfunded tax cut proposal  Keir Starmer has accused Jeremy Hunt of repeating the budget mistakes made by Liz Truss during her disastrous premiership. In comments on the budget during a visit to a building site this morning, Starmer focused on Hunt’s proposal to abolish employees’ national insurance over time, saying that this was a bigger unfunded tax promise than those in Truss’s mini-budget. (See 9.28am.) He also said that it was “humiliating” for Hunt to have to announce the abolition of non-dom status, a longstanding Labour proposal that Starmer wanted to use to fund some of his policies, including more investment in the NHS. Starmer said:  How humiliating was that for the government yesterday? We’ve argued for years that they should get rid of the non-dom tax status, they’ve resisted that. And now, completely out of ideas, the only decent policy they’ve got is the one that they’ve lifted from us. Obviously we will keep our commitment to the NHS, so important it is. We’ll go through all of the numbers and we’ll be absolutely clear nothing in our manifesto will be unfunded and uncosted. That is an iron rule for the Labour party. Contrast that with the government, where, yesterday, at the end of the budget, the chancellor made a staggering £46bn unfunded commitment to abolish national insurance. That’s bigger than Liz Truss’s commitment, so they’ve learned absolutely nothing.  The Labour claim overlooks the fact that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts triggered financial panic because they were specific measures which would have been implemented if they had not been swiftly reversed. Hunt was also talking about a massive tax cut, without saying how it might be funded, but he made it clear that this was just a long-term aspiration, and not something that at present has any impact on government finances.     10.59am GMT  IFS says Hunt's budget has not done anything to significantly address multiple economic problems facing UK  Amol Rajan may have been understating the problems facing Britain in his question to Jeremy Hunt this morning (see 10.33am), if the Institute for Fiscal Studies’s assessment is anything to go by. This is how Paul Johnson, the IFS director, opened his speech at the IFS presentation where its experts have been explaining the significance of what was announced yesterday.  Nothing that Jeremy Hunt did yesterday, nor anything the OBR said, changes anything very significantly. Which is a shame. Because that means we are still: -heading for a parliament in which people will on average be worse off at the end than at the start, -looking at a debt to GDP ratio that is at its highest level in 70 years and is showing no signs of falling; -facing debt interest payments at close to all time highs; -seeing worrying increases in the number of individuals moving onto health and disability related benefits, bringing huge challenges for those households and rising costs for the public purse; -(despite the genuinely significant cuts in NICs) stuck with a situation where tax revenues will have risen by a record amount as a share of national income over this parliament and still heading towards UK record levels; -implicitly planning on big cuts in public investment spending overall and cuts to many areas of day-to-day spending on public services despite very obvious signs of strain in many areas. All of that was true on Tuesday, and all of it remains true today. In all likelihood it will still be true come the general election.  I will post more from the IFS assessment shortly.     10.48am GMT   More in Common UK, a group campaigning to reduce political divisions, which carries out a great deal of public opinion research, conducted a focus group last night on the budget.

Towards the end of what was otherwise a relatively good-tempered interview, Amol Rajan said:  This might be, and you’ll say you don’t want it to be, one of your last big acts in politics. Do you really think you’ve read the moment? This is a country ravaged by economic shocks, at best drifting, at worse, stagnant. We all know about its potential, but we’ve had seven quarters of falling GDP per head, that’s been revised downwards. We’re hooked on foreign labour, the birth rate is collapsing. Many public services are creaking, councils are going bust. Those are facts, has your budget really come even close to meeting the scale of the challenges this country faces?  In response, Hunt said:  I think the overall characterisation that you’ve just given of the British economy is unworthy of the BBC.  Rajan insisted that there was “no such thing as ‘the BBC’”, because so many different people worked there, and he said he was “just putting to you facts about this country”. But Hunt replied: “It’s unworthy of you Amol.”  “Has your Budget come close to meeting the scale of the challenges this country faces?”@AmolRajan lists a stagnant economy, creaking public services and a reliance on foreign labour.Jeremy Hunt says he ‘believes it has’ and calls the characterisation ‘unworthy of the BBC’.— BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) March 7, 2024   Updated at 10.34am GMT    10.24am GMT  8m pensioners who pay income tax will lose £1,000 each on average from threshold freeze, Resolution Foundation says  The Resolution Foundation has described pensioners as the the biggest losers from the budget. In its analysis, it says:  Looking beyond just employees, though, personal taxes are still going up significantly, with threshold freezes exceeding value of NI rate cuts by £20bn (£41bn versus £21bn). What’s going on? £8bn is being raised by the freezes to thresholds for employer NI, which in time should feed through into lower pay levels for employees. And there is a big group of losers: pensioners, who are already exempt from NI but affected by freezes to income tax thresholds. All 8 million taxpaying pensioners will see their taxes increase, by an average of £1,000 – an £8bn collective hit. This approach is justified with tax cuts focused on working-age employees and the self-employed, who currently pay higher rates of tax than pensioners or landlords, but it is a staggering turnaround from the approach of Conservative governments since 2010, who have generally focused support on pensioners.  Commenting on the figures, Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said:  This Conservative government has shown their true colours, pensioners are not their priority. They would rather cut taxes for the big banks than look after those who have given so much for so long to our society.  But Jeremy Hunt rejected this claim. He told Sky News:  We’ve done an enormous amount for pensioners. This government introduced the triple lock … we have really prioritised pensioners.   Updated at 12.11pm GMT    10.11am GMT   Prompted by this story, a reader asks:  Can Hunt, or anyone, actually pay more tax than is due?  Yes. If you think you should pay more tax, there is nothing to stop you sending a cheque to the Treasury. Stanley Baldwin famously did this in 1919, donating a fifth of his wealth, the equivalent of £5m today, as a contribution to paying off. He wrote an anonymous letter to the Times urging other wealthy people to do the same. Later he was named as the author of the letter, and he subsequently served three terms as prime minister. I am not aware of any modern precedent, although when Gordon Brown was chancellor, and a pensioner angrily sent him a cheque for 75p after the state pension was increased by just 75p a week, Brown ensured that the cheque was cashed and that the 75p went into the Treasury’s coffers. UPDATE: A reader (Stan) points out that there is a page on the government’s website explaining how you can make voluntary donations to the Treasury. In 2017 the FT reported that the government had received 200 gifts throught this system since 2000.  Updated at 7.42am GMT    10.02am GMT  UK to have first parliament in modern history with fall in living standards, says Resolution Foundation  Household incomes are on course to fall for the first time over the course of a parliament despite Jeremy Hunt’s national insurance cuts, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has said in its assessment of the budget. Phillip Inman has the story.   Related: UK to have first parliament in modern history with fall in living standards, says thinktank       9.44am GMT  Hunt admits Tories would not be able to abolish national insurance 'any time soon'  Jeremy Hunt has conceded that the Conservative will not be able to abolish employees’ national insurance, as he has said he would like to do (see 9.28am), any time soon, Asked when this might happen, he told Times Radio:  That’s a huge job. [National insurance] raises an enormous amount of money. And I don’t think it’s realistic to say that’s going to happen any time soon. But I do want to end the unfairness of a system where the income you get from work is taxed twice through income tax and national insurance.      9.38am GMT  Hunt's national insurance giveway 'funded by fiscal fiction spending cuts', says Resolution Foundation  The Resolution Foundation thinktank has published its assessment of the budget. At a news conference, James Smith, the RF’s research director, said Jeremy Hunt’s £20bn national insurance giveaway was funded by planned cuts to public spending that were so implausible they amounted to “fiscal fiction”. He said:  The government are pencilling overall day-to-day spending numbers beyond the end of the spending review, from 2025-26 onwards. And if you take out what the government has said it will guarantee in terms of health, defence, education, then you end up with those unprotected departments … with really, really big cuts. So this is something like three-quarters of the intensity of the cuts that we got from 2010 and it’s getting on for £20bn. So you can think of tax cuts, the £20bn national insurance giveaway that we’ve had since autumn has been essentially funded by these fiscal fiction spending cuts that are pencilled in.  Smith also said the UK has had almost two decades without real-terms wage growth. He said:  We don’t get back to the pre-2008 level of real wages until 2026. So that’s nearly two lost decades of real wage growth. So that’s an incredibly bleak backdrop in terms of living standards. If you look at overall income, this is going to be the first parliament, which we have comparable income data for, where income is actually falling in real household disposable income terms.   Updated at 9.41am GMT    9.28am GMT  Labour says Hunt’s long-term plan to abolish national insurance amounts to a £46bn unfunded tax cut  Good morning. If a budget is going to unravel, that often starts to happen on day two, after the initial headlines have gone and when the experts start to unpack what it really means. So far, there is not much sign of that happening, because Jeremy Hunt did not announce much yesterday that had not been well trailed in advance. But the reaction in Tory circles is a bit flat. And Labour has leapt on one of the more half-hearted proposals in the budget to make the case that Hunt is being even more irresponsible than Liz Truss. Hunt said yesterday the Tories had a “long-term ambition” to get rid of employees’ national insurance. And in an email to Tory supporters last night Hunt said (bold text from the original):  This time, we’ve cut national insurance AGAIN – from 10% to 8%. In total, across both tax cuts, that means the average British worker keeps £900 more a year. But there’s further to go. I’d like to end the unfairness where people in work are paying tax twice on their earnings. We want a simpler, fairer tax system where you only pay tax once. If we stick with our plan that’s working, we’ll be able to make progress towards that goal in the next parliament.  Labour says this would cost £46bn. It has sent out this briefing with the costings.  It would cost many tens of billions to abolish NICs [national insurance contributions] entirely: £39.96bn to abolish employee NICs main rate, going from 8p to 0p £2.28bn to abolish self-employed NICs, going from a 6p rate to 0p £2.9bn to abolish employee NICs additional rate, going from 2p to 0p £0.54bn to abolish self-employed NICs additional rate, going from 2p to 0p That means that in total Jeremy Hunt wants to deliver £46bn of unfunded tax cuts That is £1bn more than the £45bn of unfunded tax cuts in the disastrous Truss mini-budget.  Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has been giving interviews this morning. She said that Labour is constantly being challenged to explain how it will fund its pledges (she admitted she now has to find money to pay for the proposals that would have been funded by the abolition of non-dom status), but Hunt now had to explain how he would fund a £46bn cut. She told the Today programme:  You just asked me how I’m going to find £2.1bn, and I will do that. But the government yesterday suggested that are going to cut national insurance entirely at a cost of £46bn pounds a year. That is a bigger unfunded commitment to tax cuts than even Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng tried. So the question to the chancellor is, is this a real promise, is this a real commitment? And, if so, how is that going to be funded? I want taxes on working people to come down. But I’m never going to make a commitment without saying where the money is going to come from.  Hunt has also been giving interviews this morning. I will post more from both interview rounds shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Resolution Foundation publishes its budget analysis at a press conference. 9.30am: Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes its budget analysis at a press conference. Morning: Rishi Sunak takes part in a Q&A in a pub in Yorkshire. Morning: Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves visit a building site in London. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 11.30am: MPs resume their debate on the budget. After 12pm: Rishi Sunak is interviewed on Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show. 1pm: Badenoch gives a speech at the Global Trade conference. Also, David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is visiting Berlin. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "The Treasury disbanded a unit tasked with offshore and non-dom tax policy weeks before announcing significant changes in the budget to the way foreign residents are taxed, sources have said. The unit, which comprised technical experts on offshore tax issues, included specialists on non-dom policy. These officials would, according. to the sources, have been expected to help manage the implementation of a replacement for non-dom status as outlined by the chancellor this week. It is understood officials fear the Treasury is ill-prepared for an onslaught of lobbying from the wealth advisory industry, which is already seeking to overturn or shift the abolition of the tax break. One City law firm that specialises in advising clients with complex offshore tax affairs, told staff they expected a rush to “safeguard” benefits of the status – such as creating offshore trusts while claiming the status in order to avoid UK inheritance tax – before changes are put in place, according to an internal memo. A second law firm told staff advising on offshore matters not to book leave for the first three months of 2025. Jeremy Hunt said non-domicile status and the tax breaks linked to it would be abolished from April 2025. Under the regime, residents with links to another country who claim they plan to eventually leave the UK can avoid tax on any income and gains from assets held outside Britain. But they must still pay tax on any income they receive in the UK. The tax break, a legacy of colonial times, has saved some of the country’s wealthiest individuals millions in tax. The rules on who can claim to be non-domiciled are relatively vague. A ready reckoner used by HMRC is often whether or not someone’s father was born overseas. Tax experts have long argued the break means high net-worth individuals are in effect incentivised not to onshore their wealth. Non-doms have to stop using the status for income tax purposes after they have been resident for more than 15 of the past 20 years. It is optional, and has to be proactively claimed by an individual on a so-called remittance basis. Those wanting the breaks must pay an annual fee of £30,000 if they have lived in the UK for seven of the past nine tax years, rising to £60,000 a year if they have lived in the country for 12 of the past 14 years. Some non-dom tax breaks will survive the overhaul. For example, those currently claiming the status will be able to avoid UK inheritance tax by putting their overseas assets in a trust. This can be an extremely valuable boon that outlasts short term income-based wins. The Treasury has been contacted for comment."

        "content": "Just when you thought it was safe to go out again … Most people who care about their sanity will have spent much of Wednesday hiding under a duvet. It’s one thing to endure a budget that is pretending to be something it isn’t. That’s insult enough. It’s another scale of hell, though, when the gaslighter-in-chief who is delivering this nonsense is Jeremy Hunt. Someone so obviously out of his depth as chancellor, it’s painful to watch. A man so bad at his job, he has had to pay more than £100,000 so far to stay in it. Not the best investment he’s ever made as he’s likely to lose his seat at the next election. Hardly the ideal advertisement for Jezza’s financial savvy. If his family and friends really cared about Hunt’s mental health they would persuade him to quit. Try and talk his ego down. It’s OK, Jezza. You’ve nothing to prove. You’re just making things worse for yourself. It can only end in total humiliation. A Michael Portillo moment. So quit while you’re behind. Don’t worry about finding another job. Someone will sort something out for you. They always do for men like Jeremy. If the worst comes to the worst, you can chill out in the Lords. Unfortunately, though, there was more to come. Because tradition dictates that the chancellor has to endure trial by radio and television the next day on the morning media round. By which time the more obvious fictions in the budget have begun to unravel and the Tory backbenchers are busy preparing their resignation letters to their constituencies as they can’t face losing their seat or a decade in opposition. So everyone’s breakfast got wrecked. Lucky us. Thursday morning found Jezza in Liverpool. Though he didn’t seem to know what he was doing there. Then, he seldom seems to know what he is doing from one minute to the next. He gives the appearance of being permanently startled. Boggle-eyed and startled. As if everything is a complete mystery to him. Every day a new adventure. He’s like a fantastically dim – if generally amiable – labrador that lives entirely in the present. By the time Hunt turned up for the 8.10 interview on Radio 4’s Today programme, he was already looking decidedly ragged. As if his mental faculties had been tested to the limit. On BBC Breakfast he had come to the conclusion that libelling academics was an essential part of a cabinet minister’s duties. With friends like this, Michelle Donelan will be toast by next week. And on Times Radio, dearest Jezza had had to admit that the whole section in his budget speech on getting rid of national insurance had been a fantasy. He had no idea how it could possibly have got in there. Such a shame then, that it became the Daily Telegraph splash. The rightwing media are partial to a £45bn unfunded spending commitment. Now Jeremy was to fall apart. Amol Rajan began with immigration. In his speech, Hunt had said that growth couldn’t come with unlimited immigration. But in the small print of the Office for Budget Responsibility, it clearly stated that the only way the government could meet its growth targets was by increasing immigration. So he had been telling porkies, hadn’t he? “That’s not true,” Jezza said, trying to stem the rising sense of panic. So he then answered another question entirely. Maybe if you reclassified immigrants as non-immigrants then everything would be fine. Rajan didn’t have time to argue the toss. It would be pointless. Halfwits are bad enough. But stubborn halfwits who can’t connect with reality are the limit. Next up were the OBR forecasts that said GDP per head had been downgraded. That too, according to Hunt, was not true. “It’s a mechanical mathematical problem,” he said tartly. Really? How the hell would he know, even if it was? Is there anyone left in the country who actually thinks Jezza understands the finer points of statistical analysis? Because he consistently misses the point when he repeats the lie that UK is far better off than Germany. “So who is worse off in this budget?” asked Rajan. Jezza needed to think for a while. Non-doms, he said eventually. He had always wanted to close that loophole. Which is obviously why he had never done it. Deferred gratification. He could also have mentioned pensioners. But best to hope your core vote hadn’t noticed they had been screwed. And how about those affected by the infected blood scandal? Jezza had prioritised a tax giveaway over doing the right thing for people who had been badly betrayed. All heart. On to fiscal drag and the highest tax burden since 1948. Jezza hurriedly shuffled his script and looked for salvation. “The difference between us and Labour is that we want to bring taxes down,” he sobbed. Mmm. Most of us want to do a lot of things. How about we all decide that we want to pay our taxes but unfortunately we’ve come to the conclusion we just can’t do it this year? Because that’s the level of nonsense we’ve reached. HMRC are going to love that. Now Jezza was starting to get really shirty. He wasn’t being shown nearly enough respect. The way it worked was that he invented an economic fiction and a compliant media reported it as if it was really going to happen. Which, to be fair, is frequently what happens with Tory ministers. But not this time. Rajan reminded him that as health secretary he had promised in 2013 that there would be numerous cost efficiencies in the NHS by 2018. None of which had happened. So why should we believe him this time? B-b-because … B-b-because, he said so. Hunt speaks, the world listens. Feel the entitlement. There was going to be a new drone force patrolling the skies for health emergencies. Anyone thought unlikely to survive would be machine-gunned. Call it the New Triage. We then reached the closing credits. Rajan rattled off the list of political and economic failures of the last 14 years. So familiar, we all know them by heart these days. “That’s unworthy of the BBC,” shrieked Jezza. “And it’s unworthy of you, Amol.” Yup, unworthy to point out some uncontroversial home truths. The BBC was meant to be an extension of the Tory party. Didn’t everyone know we were going through an economic paradise? The cost of living crisis a distant memory. We had all never had it so good. Give thanks and praise to the mighty Jez. “I’ve done my best,” Jezza wept. Gestalt therapy so often ends in tears. Hunt probably had done his best. After all, no one had high expectations of him. It’s just that his best isn’t nearly good enough. A decline in real wages for two decades. We really might as well not have bothered. Thank you and goodbye. The line went dead. Perhaps now, someone would tell Hunt what he was doing in Liverpool."

How much further can they fall?” one activist in the CDO South East group said. Another added: “Knocking 2p off will do nothing for the working people Sunak and Hunt need to go.”\nA third person added: “Another nail in the coffin of this present ‘Conservative’ [mis]administration.” Members of the group shared a petition organised by the Conservative Post website calling for Rishi Sunak’s resignation.\nOne supporter said Sunak and Hunt “seem to have found an uncanny way of making things better for the rich”. Another activist said: “Your average PAYE employee with a home and family doesn’t appear to have gained much, if anything, at all.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nA CDO member in the north of England said of the budget: “Not only are they kicking people when down they’re wiping their feet all over us.”\nActivists were also critical of Sunak and Hunt’s political performance, saying the chancellor was “not an engaging orator” and that they both “speak in the same tone like management consultants brought in to validate the management consensus”.\nThe CDO was created in December 2022 by the Tory donor and Johnson supporter Peter Cruddas. It has received high-profile support from senior Tories, with Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries addressing its conference last May.\nIts website features a quote from Patel, who has been touted as a potential leadership candidate, saying: “Our grassroots are the heart and soul of our party … we need to empower them to have more say over our policies and candidates. That will make us stronger, more successful in government, and boost our membership numbers.”\nThe Guardian reported last month that CDO members had lashed out at Sunak over his decision to suspend Lee Anderson, who was deputy chair of the Conservatives until January. Anderson lost the party whip after he refused to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control of” the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and that he had “given our capital city away to his mates”.\nThe CDO claims to have thousands of Conservatives signed up and campaigns for changes in the party constitution that would give more power to the grassroots. It wants party members to have greater say over policy and the authority to select and deselect parliamentary candidates, including sitting MPs, with minimal interference from party HQ.\nOnly card-carrying party members can be full members of the CDO, according to its website. Lapsed Tory members can be “associate members” as long as they have not joined another party.\nSurveys suggest the Conservative grassroots more broadly are pessimistic about their party’s prospects. A survey of Tory activists by the ConservativeHome website found last month that 65% believed Labour would win a majority at the next election, and only 13% believed there would be a Tory-led government.\nA separate ConservativeHome survey found nearly two-thirds of party members opposed Anderson’s suspension from the Tory whip."

        "content": "UK politics must learn to “disagree well” or risk a descent into toxic, US-style culture wars, three influential thinktanks with links to the Conservatives and Labour have warned in a joint statement. Before a conference on Friday focusing on community cohesion, the Onward, Labour Together and Create Streets thinktanks said that as well as promoting political accord, there was a need to tackle crumbling towns and wider urban decay to fix fraying social bonds. The event in Coventry will be addressed by Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, who has emerged as a key voice among Tories calling for consensus, as opposed to those expressing more divisive rhetoric, such as Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick. Another speaker will be Carlos Moreno, the Paris-based academic who devised the urban-planning idea of “15-minute cities”, which has become a focus of conspiracy theories, including recent remarks by other ministers. In their joint statement, the thinktanks called for efforts to “reimagine new forms for our communities”. They said: “That is particularly true in an election year. How do we restitch communities, empowering local groups and councils and ensuring that we are listening to those with direct experience of our crumbling towns and villages? “How do we restitch politics, ‘disagreeing well’ as a society and avoiding the terrifyingly toxic mutual mistrust now common in America? How do we restitch neighbourhoods, physically reweaving places scarred by urban dual-carriageways or inhumane design?” The Tory-linked Onward is seen as particularly close to Rishi Sunak, who used a hastily arranged speech in Downing Street last Friday to call for more community cohesion, having warned days earlier that “mob rule” was dominating the UK.   Related: Extremists trying to tear us apart, says Rishi Sunak in impromptu No 10 speech   Labour Together is close to Keir Starmer, while Create Streets is headed by Nicholas Boys Smith, the government’s most senior urbanism adviser, who chairs the Office for Place, an organisation created by Michael Gove that helps guide planning ideas. In comments released before the conference, Tugendhat said the internal security and cohesion of the UK “rests in the long term on the strength of our social fabric”, adding: “Our democracy is only as strong as the relationship between strangers who share the same citizenship.” This focus on improving community relations and encouraging more positive political dialogue echoes elements of Sunak’s speech on Friday, in which he seemingly sought to pull back from a focus on the supposed threat from the likes of pro-Palestine demonstrators and other protest groups. His speech followed comments by Braverman and Jenrick, the former Home Office ministers who have sought to frame recent tensions as almost entirely the responsibility of Islamist extremists, and by Lee Anderson, the former Tory deputy chair, who lost the party whip after claiming that “Islamists” had “got control” of Sadiq Khan, the London mayor."

        "content": "Political parties accepted £93m in donations last year, boosted by new Conservative and Labour mega-donors, with the 2024 election on course to be the highest-spending contest ever. Figures from the Electoral Commission show the Tories raised £9.8m and Labour £6m in the last quarter of the year. Labour said 2023 was its biggest ever year for fundraising, and the traditional gap between the two parties in how much they are able to raise from individual donors appears to be narrowing. The Conservatives received £10m from the healthcare tech entrepreneur Frank Hester and his company, the Phoenix Partnership (Leeds). Hester is a new donor to the party and said he was backing Rishi Sunak because of his approach to AI. Another big donor was Selva Pankaj, who runs the privately owned Regent College London and other education businesses, who gave £125,000. Labour’s biggest donor in 2023 was Gary Lubner, the former Autoglass boss, who contributed £4.5m. He first started giving to the party in 2022. Fran Perrin, a daughter of the peer David Sainsbury, is Labour’s biggest ever female donor. She started giving large sums from 2021 and has now donated more than £2.3m. The parties are likely to raise record amounts before the election after the Conservatives raised the spending limits for the pre-election period from £19m to £34m. Louise Edwards, the director of regulation at the Electoral Commission, said: “Over £93m in donations was accepted by political parties during 2023, nearly double the amount in the previous year. With a general election on the horizon, it’s not unusual to see a spike in donations as political parties begin to campaign. “While there is no limit to what parties can raise, there are spending limits in place ahead of elections to ensure a level playing field.” In the year leading up to David Cameron’s 2015 election, political parties raised a total of £96m. The figure was £73m in the year running up to Theresa May’s snap contest in 2017 and £117m in the lead-up to Boris Johnson’s victory in 2019. Among those who donated cash last year was Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, who gave more money to his own constituency Conservative party in the last four months to boost his chances of re-election. The chancellor donated £18,084 last November, Electoral Commission records show, pushing the total amount he has given since the last general election to £123,345. This week the Guardian revealed he had given £105,261 to the South West Surrey Conservative Association over the last five years, from the last general election held in December 2019 until June 2023. The most recent accounts for Hunt’s local association said its balance sheet was “at a less than satisfactory level”. A note stated that members’ annual subscriptions were due to increase this year. Hunt’s Godalming and Ash seat is a key target for the Liberal Democrats. Polling by Savanta shows the Lib Dems are on course to take the “blue wall” constituency, which would make Hunt the first chancellor in modern times to lose his seat in the Commons. Over the last week, Hunt has repeatedly said he hopes he will “carry on serving” his voters, and noted: “I hope to be the chancellor after the election.” When asked whether he had spent £105,000 from February 2021 to June 2023 over fears of losing his seat, Hunt told Sky News on Wednesday: “I put that money in mainly because during the pandemic it was not possible to do fundraising in the normal way. “I’ve got a brilliant team in my constituency and we do some fantastic local campaigning and I wanted that to continue despite the fact that we couldn’t fundraise. But have I [got] a tough fight against the Lib Dems? Absolutely. And I’ve never taken that for granted.” "

This week, the UK marks the 40th anniversary of the start of the 1984 miners’ strike, when at least 142,000 miners withdrew their labour in attempts to block colliery closures. Despite the historic industrial dispute, the eventual closures changed the face of these areas, with ex-coalfield regions today more likely to be deprived and have less faith in politics. But despite the passing of four decades, memories from that period remain powerful for many who lived through it. Communities were split between striking miners and those who crossed the picket lines – and after the mines were closed by the Conservative government, a way of life was lost. Woolford, whose father and two grandfathers were coalminers, feels she has “witnessed the dismantling of opportunity for young people” that she benefited from in the 1960s and 1970s. She says it was no golden age and recalls coal mining as a punishing industry; her father was injured at work when she was seven and he later worked in the control room above ground. “It wasn’t a glamorous job,” Woolford said, “but they had security, comradeship, community”. “These things feel like relics of the past now,” she says. Woolford feels that this anniversary highlights what the miners were fighting for. “They weren’t just fighting to save their jobs. They were fighting for their communities,” she said.   We look back with pride and forward with aspiration.   Later this month, former mining families in Armthorpe will parade through the village from the site of the pit to the community centre, with a band playing, speeches and banners. As it prepares to mark the strike’s 40th anniversary, Chris Brodhurst-Brown, the chair of Armthorpe’s parish council, said the village is not just looking back to a time before the pit closures. It has its sights set on the future, too. “Although our village was brought to its knees after the strike and subsequent closures, it holds itself proud, is full of community spirit and a sought after place to live,” Brodhurst-Brown, 65, said. “Thatcher tried to break us but she didn’t. The mining families form the spine of our community spirit.” Brodhurst-Brown, 65, whose grandfather, father and first husband were all miners, said mining jobs gave the village of Armthorpe and the housing estate where she grew up a sense of social cohesion. Some of that sense of togetherness stemmed from the danger of mining work, she said. “My first husband, I’d never send him off to work on a bad word or a row because there was a genuine chance he wouldn’t come back. One of our neighbours was killed – it was a very real thing, we were desperately trying to look out for one another. The men and the families relied on each other.” The pit closure in 1992 led to “a real gloom,” she said, that “ripped the heart out of the village”. But Brodhurst-Brown said Armthorpe has done relatively OK. “We’ve regenerated economically well – there’s been lots of new housebuilding. New people sustain and grow the village. Things aren’t perfect but comparatively, the village is a prosperous place,” she said, though she added pockets of deprivation existed, with working families on low wages. The village has benefited from being on major routes, Brodhurst-Brown explained, with good access to shops, modern businesses and logistics. Brodhurst-Brown said Armthorpe had changed, but its spirit had remained. “Lots of the pubs and clubs have gone, all those good, proud, yet dangerous mining jobs have gone. Everywhere in the country has changed though, it’s not just us. We’re not just sat there looking at bits of coal and pit lamps and thinking about what used to be,” she said. “We look back with pride, however we also look forward with aspiration.”   What the pit closures didn’t kill off, austerity came and finished the job.   Garry McKay, a 59-year-old from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was 18 when the miners’ strike began and has watched the town change over the last four decades. McKay became a social worker in 1994 and today manages adult social care and health services in the Mansfield and Ashfield areas. The job, he said, has given him a front-row seat on the deprivation locally: health problems, poor housing, poverty, addiction, loneliness. “People’s lives dipped when the pits closed and they probably never recovered financially, and now it’s taking a toll on their health,” he said. “It’s bleak.” His family had been coalminers since the 1850s, he said, but in 1984-85 his dad crossed the picket line. “I was ashamed of him,” McKay recalls, but looking back, “I think he probably suffered a lot of abuse, [but] never brought it home.” There was a belief that Nottinghamshire collieries would be secure from government closures, as they often continued working and helped the National Coal Board win the dispute. But Mansfield was shut in 1988, and McKay’s father died a few years later. Over the next couple of decades, the town’s fortunes declined. After the pit closure and ensuing job losses, a number of the town’s breweries and pubs closed, houses were repossessed, and local textile jobs also declined. “I was unemployed for a couple of years in the early 1990s, there were really no jobs at all,” McKay said. He remembers a bizarre week spent on a weeklong course by the dole office – sat doing crosswords with a group of dejected out-of-work older men. The intervening decades saw some efforts at regeneration. But McKay feels any recovery was choked off by the cuts of the 2010s. “What the pit closures didn’t kill off, austerity came along with [David] Cameron 14 years ago and finished the job very well.”   People have lost faith.   Sue Lawson, 64, believes the pits were closed without sufficient long-term economic planning. Lawson, who works for Hetton Town Trust, a charity formed out of the former miners’ welfare organisation, has lived near the former mining village of Hetton-le-Hole in County Durham since 1999. “The closure of the pits was bad enough,” she said. But the real issue was “the manner in which it was done, with very little afterthought”, particularly for the younger generations who “would have naturally followed their fathers down the pit”. Lawson was 24, newly married and living in the ex-steel town of Consett, County Durham when the strike started. Lawson’s husband, Peter, worked as an engineer for a company that supplied equipment for coal mining, which provoked nervousness for their futures. “We were pretty hard up at the time but did what we could to support the miners,” she said. In October 1992, John Major’s government announced plans to close 31 UK pits with about 31,000 job losses. In Lawson’s area, some mining-related job losses were offset, such as by the 1986 opening of a Nissan factory that today employs about 6,000 people. Sunderland, the local authority that includes Hetton-le-Hole, is now the 23rd most income-deprived, according to the ONS, out of 316 local authorities in England “Like many colliery towns, the centre is rundown, with a few empty shops. On the periphery, new housing estates are being built, but as there are not many well paid jobs locally, many people commute to Durham, Peterlee, Newcastle,” Lawson said. Lawson believes Labour’s 2019 manifesto “had some very good policies that would have benefited areas like ours”. But she now feels people have lost faith that either the Conservatives or Labour can change the picture. If Labour wins the next general election, she has concerns Keir Starmer’s “hands are going to be pretty much tied” by poor Treasury finances, Lawson said. “Let’s hope that [Labour] do get in, but we’re starting from such a low base, and that doesn’t give me much hope. Because you think, well, how much worse has it got to get before we start turning a corner?”"

        "content": "Modern Life is Rubbish, Blur once famously pronounced. Well, after the band’s drummer was selected as a Labour candidate at the next general election, they may hope to change the situation. Dave Rowntree will stand in Mid Sussex, the party announced on Wednesday evening. The constituency includes Burgess Hill, Haywards Heath and the Mid Sussex villages. After spending the 1990s battling Oasis, Rowntree will now have to do battle against the Conservatives who currently hold the seat. However, Mims Davies, the incumbent MP, announced in May that she would stand in the new seat of East Grinstead and Uckfield, which will contain parts of the current Mid Sussex constituency. In a statement, Rowntree said: “I’m delighted to have the opportunity to become Labour’s first Mid Sussex MP. “Residents have their best chance in a generation to make their vote count and return a Labour MP to parliament. The Tories have run out of ideas, and the Lib Dems have run out of steam. “I’m running for parliament to provide the energy and vision the area so desperately needs.” The Mid Sussex Labour group posted on X: “We think Dave will be an excellent and very successful candidate.” Rowntree is among the four founding members of the band along with the singer, Damon Albarn; the guitarist, Graham Coxon; and the bass player, Alex James. Last summer, Blur played two gigs at Wembley, their first major UK shows since 2015 when they performed at Hyde Park. Getting his campaign machine started early, Rowntree was scathing of Wednesday’s budget, saying on X: “This is the weirdest budget ever. A bunch of minor policy announcements. Is there a flourish at the end? The musician added: “What a waste of an hour. Tiny policy announcements. Fiddling with the tax system. Bogus productivity savings rather than proper funding. AI fixing all problems.” Other MPs who have swapped music for Westminster include the Conservative MP David Morris, who was a guitarist in the 1980s. Pete Wishart, the SNP MP for Perth and North Perthshire, was a founder member of the Scottish rock group Big Country and part of the group Runrig. In December, Tom Gray, of the rock band Gomez, was selected as the Labour candidate for the Brighton Pavilion constituency in the upcoming general election."

        "content": "UK taxpayers have financed a £15,000 payout to an academic after the science minister wrongly accused her of supporting Hamas, the department has said amid growing political anger at why public money was used. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said £15,000 had been paid after a statement on Tuesday by Michelle Donelan, about a “clarification” from Prof Kate Sang, of Heriot-Watt university in Edinburgh, about her views. This money came from public funds, a DSIT spokesperson said, adding: “There is an established precedent under multiple administrations that ministers are provided with legal support and representation where matters relate to their conduct and responsibilities as a minister, as was the case here. “The secretary of state received the appropriate advice from relevant officials at all times. “A sum of £15,000 was paid without admitting any liability. This approach is intended to reduce the overall costs to the taxpayer that could result from protracted legal action, no matter what the result would have been.”   Related: UK science minister apologises and pays damages after academic’s libel action   It is understood that the payment was the only one made, with no extra contribution for Sang’s legal costs. DSIT declined to say how much Donelan’s own legal costs were. On Tuesday, the department had refused to say how much had been paid to Sang, saying only that it was a “nominal” sum. However, opposition parties and some Conservative MPs have expressed alarm that Donelan has been supported in this way, with one Tory backbencher saying it was “astonishing she still has a job”. Sang launched a libel action against Donelan after the minister published a letter to the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) in October that urged it to cut links with Sang and another academic, Dr Kamna Patel of University College London. Donelan had described her “disgust and outrage” at their appointment to an expert advisory group to Research England on equality, diversity and inclusion. The institute suspended Sang and Patel while it carried out an investigation into Donelan’s allegations. These included that both academics had shared extremist content, and that Sang expressed sympathy for Hamas. Her evidence included Sang retweeting a Guardian article from last October headlined “Suella Braverman urges police to crack down on Hamas support in UK”, to which Sang added the comment: “This is disturbing.” In her statement, Donelan said she had been mistaken in taking this to mean support for Hamas, and that Sang’s comment had been about the article more widely. UKRI announced that its investigation found no evidence to back Donelan’s complaints against the academics, or any grounds to remove them from the advisory group. Peter Kyle, the shadow science secretary, said: “It is outrageous that £15,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on the science secretary calling a scientist a terrorist sympathiser on social media, without any evidence at all. “Michelle Donelan should be embarrassed, she should apologise, and she should repay the full amount back to the taxpayer. Her conduct falls so far below that expected of a minister.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said: “This is nothing short of a scandal and we still don’t know the full legal costs. “If Michelle Donelan had a shred of integrity left, she would pay for this bill out of her own pocket instead of asking taxpayers to pick up the tab. If she refuses to do so, Rishi Sunak should dock her pay.” It comes on the same day that it emerged that a Conservative peer, the former MEP Jacqueline Foster, had apologised and paid damages to a doctoral student after wrongly saying an octopus soft toy used as her University Challenge team’s mascot was chosen as an antisemitic symbol. Lady Foster had already apologised publicly and privately to Melika Gorgianeh, a doctoral student in astrophysics at the University of Oxford, after comments made after the episode of the BBC Two quizshow was broadcast in November. In a new post on X on Wednesday, Lady Foster reiterated her apology and said she had paid “substantial damages and costs” to Gorgianeh."

        "content": "\n 6.38pm GMT \nEarly evening summary\n\n\nJeremy Hunt has announced a 2p national insurance cut in his budget as a pre-election gambit to revive flatlining opinion poll ratings and reboot Britain’s economy from recession. The 2p cut had been widely reported in advance, and Hunt’s speech lacked a surprise announcement that might have energised Tory MPs, beyond a vague (and fairly implausible) suggestion that the Tories might abolish employees’ national insurance in the long term. (See 2.52pm.) \nHere is Larry Elliott’s analysis.\n\n\n Related: Jeremy Hunt’s last budget before an election – but not his last roll of the dice \n\nAnd here is an extract from Larry’s piece.\n\nJeremy Hunt is in favour of delaying the election until the autumn, and it showed. His second budget had all the hallmarks of a holding operation from a government hoping the summer will bring better economic news and leave open the possibility of another package of measures in six or seven months’ time.\nSure, there was the much-heralded cut in national insurance contributions, which formed the biggest chunk of a front-loaded £14bn stimulus package. Certainly, he took every opportunity to have a pop at Labour in a deeply political speech. This will be the last budget before the election, but it did not feel like the last roll of the dice for the government.\nHunt did what all chancellors do on budget day. He accentuated the positive. There was much talk about how the economy had turned a corner, but nothing about how this is on course to be the first parliament in modern times where living standards have fallen. He was keen to say that taxes had been cut by £900 for the average worker as a result of last year’s autumn statement and this year’s budget. He forgot to mention that the long-running policy of freezing thresholds means the Treasury is still sucking spending power out of the economy in this and every year until the end of the decade. The budget tax cuts mean the fiscal tightening for 2024-25 is just over £41bn rather than the £56bn previously planned.\n\n\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, used his response to the budget to say that policies implemented by the Conservatives over the past 14 years had left Britain in a “vicious downward spiral”. He said:\n\n\nThe reality is, there is no path to economic stability, no way to a calmer, less chaotic politics, with the party opposite in power.\nBecause chaos is now their worldview. A mindset that sees Britain’s problems as opportunities they can exploit. Whether, like the chancellor, that’s out of desperation because they can’t solve them. Or whether, like the [Suella Braverman or Liz Truss], they have no intention of solving them whatsoever.\nFor a party this weak and divided – the end result is always the same. A vicious downward spiral. Chaos feeding off decline. Decline feeding off chaos.\nWhile working people pay the price.\nThe British people know – this will not stop.\n\nStarmer said little about the specific budget meaures in his speech, although Labour later indicated that it will try to find alternative ways of funding the policy commitments it planned to fund using tax measures now adopted by the Tories. (See 5.57pm.) Starmer ended his speech by challenging Sunak to call a general election for 2 May. But he is unlikely to get his wish. Despite recent chatter about an early election, the consensus at Westminster is that this budget has made that less likely. For a May election, the budget would have needed to function as a springboard. Instead, this one was short on bounce.\nOn the economic front…\n\nDespite Hunt’s various tax cut announcements today, the tax burden will reach a 70-year high of 37.1 per cent of GDP in 2028-29, the Office for Budget Responsibility says. That’s the highest since 1948.\nThe economic outlook has improved slightly since November, even though the UK sank into recession at the end of last year.The OBR revised up its forecast for growth this year to 0.8%, up from 0.7% expected before. The OBR then expects growth of 1.9% in 2025, revised up from 1.4%.\nBut according to the Resolution Foundation, the UK’s slow growth means the economy is set to be smaller in real per capita terms at the time of the next election than it was at the previous election in 2019, for the first time ever.\nThe chancellor also has extremely little flexibility to hit his target to have debt falling, as a share of GDP, in five years’s time. His fiscal headroom has shrunk to £8.9bn, which is little more than a rounding error - and arguably just fantasy, as it based on unrealistically tight public spending after the election.\n\nGoodnight! AS and GW\n\nUpdated at 6.59pm GMT\n\n\n 6.17pm GMT \nBudget 2024 calculator: find out if you are better or worse off\n\nOur budget calculator, created with accountancy firm Blick Rothenburg, is now live:\n\n Related: Budget 2024 calculator: find out if you are better or worse off \n\n\nUpdated at 6.17pm GMT\n\n\n 6.16pm GMT \n\nThe two thinktanks with the most clout in budget analysis are the Institute for Fiscal Studies (see 3.50pm) and the Resolution Foundation (see 4.58pm). But here are comments from three other thinktanks.\nFrom Tom Smith, director of economic policy at the Tony Blair Institute\n\nThe only sustainable route to lowering the tax burden is to make the investments needed to fundamentally reform the state and the way public services are delivered.\nThe chancellor’s plans to harness technology to boost public sector productivity are exactly the kind of approach that the UK needs. His new £4.2bn investment over the next 5 years is a good downpayment on realising this potential. But the scale of the investment - equivalent to £840m a year (or 0.03% of GDP) - will not be enough on its own to turn around the UK’s fiscal fortunes.\nBy contrast, the cuts to national insurance announced today and in the Autumn Statement are worth more than twenty times this amount, and are a stark illustration of where the government’s priorities lie.\nThe government continues to put the cart before the horse, prioritising pre-election tax cuts over the long-term investment needed to boost growth, transform public services, and create the fiscal space for sustainable tax cuts in the future.\nOverall, today’s budget has done little to change the UK’s fiscal outlook, which still assumes taxes will rise to a post-war high and includes a severe squeeze on some public services after the election.\n\nFrom Ryan Shorthouse, executive chair of Bright Blue, a thinktank for liberal conservatism\n\nThe chancellor has set the right path for taxation, focussing on cutting national insurance rather than income tax. This is good, both intergenerationally and economically, since it rewards a younger, working-aged population who derive almost all their income from working, rather than from dividends, rents and pensions.\nFrankly, however, the measures to mitigate the perverse ‘double taxation’ of work are too little, too late from the Tories. Instead of the chancellor using his fiscal headroom for tax cuts and reliefs to all sorts of special interests, it would have been fairer and more effective to have just cut national insurance – both for employers and employees – more deeply now …\nThe bottom line is that taxation, public debt and immigration are all at record levels after 14 years of Conservative governments – the very opposite of what the public voted and expected them to do. The government has failed to take the bold steps necessary to fix this.\n\nFrom Paul Kissack, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation\n\nThis was a budget for big earners and big owners. Prioritising capital gains tax cuts for owners of multiple properties is an insult to almost four million people facing destitution in the UK today.\nThe chancellor stood up at the despatch box today and announced a short term patch up of his government’s own failed systems. He was right to extend the household support fund, which has given essential help for some families at difficult times. But extending a temporary support scheme for a paltry six months doesn’t equate to fixing the fundamental problem that made its existence necessary.\nThe government is right to acknowledge that deductions from Universal Credit which leave 97% of low income families affected by these loans having to go without essentials are driving hardship in this country. They are right to take action on this dire situation, but they must now commit to a fundamental change in our social security system which guarantees that people can always afford the essentials.\n\n\n\n\n 6.12pm GMT \nTaxpayers paying £15,000 for damages payout to academic libelled by Michelle Donelan, science department reveals\n\nIt cost taxpayers £15,000 to cover damages to an academic science secretary Michelle Donelan had falsely accused of supporting Hamas, her department has said.\nThe sum was paid “without admitting any liability”, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).\nDaisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, said it was a “scandal” that Donelan was not paying the damages herself. Cooper said:\n\nThis is nothing short of a scandal and we still don’t know the full legal costs.\nIf Michelle Donelan had a shred of integrity left, she would pay for this bill out of her own pocket instead of asking taxpayers to pick up the tab.\nIf she refuses to do so, Rishi Sunak should dock her pay.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.32pm GMT\n\n\n 6.02pm GMT \n\nToday’s net giveaway of £13.9bn in the current financial year may help end the recession before an election later this year, City consultancy Capital Economics predict.\nBut… they also warn that there are likely to be new tax hikes after the election.\nThe resulting drag on the economy may contribute to more interest rate cuts next year than most expect, bringing Bank of England base rate down from 5.25% now to 3.00% in 2025, they add.\n\n\n\n 5.57pm GMT \nLabour's Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will find 'alternative way' of funding its policies reliant on non-dom revenue\n\nJonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, has just told Radio 4 that Labour will find “an alternative way” of funding the policies it had planned to fund with revenue from the abolition of non-dom status. He said the money was going towards the NHS, and dentistry in particular. Evan Davis asked him in particular about the non-dom policies, but Reynolds answer implied that Labour would also apply this approach to the policies funded by the extension of the windfall tax on energy companies.\nBut Reynolds also said it might take the party a few days to find a precise way of funding these policies.\nThe Tories published a list of the Labour policies they now think are in jeopardy earlier. (See 3.40pm.)\n\n\n\n 5.40pm GMT \nOsborne says Hunt's plan to assess child benefit eligibility on household basis booby trap for next government\n\nJeremy Hunt announced significant changes to the rules affecting higher earners who want to claim child benefit. Child benefit is worth £24 per week for the oldest child, and £15.90 per week for other children, and overall the new system is going to be significantly more expensive than the current one, costing the Treasury more than £500m per year. This is how Hunt explained it in his speech.\n\nThe way we treat child benefit in the tax system is confusing and unfair.\nIt’s a lifeline for many parents because it helps with the additional costs associated with having children.\nAnd when it works, it’s good for children, it’s good for parents, and it’s good for the economy because it helps people into work.\nBut we currently withdraw child benefit when one parent earns over £50,000 a year.\nThat means two parents earning £49,000 a year receive the benefit in full but a household earning a lot less than that does not if just one parent earns over £50,000.\nToday I set out plans to end that unfairness. Doing so requires significant reform to the tax system including allowing HMRC to collect household level information.\nWe will therefore consult on moving the high-income child benefit charge to a household-based system to be introduced by April 2026.\nBut because that is not a quick fix, I make two changes today to make the current system fairer …\nI confirm that from this April the high-income child benefit charge threshold will be raised from £50,000 to £60,000.\nAnd we will raise the top of the taper at which it is withdrawn to £80,000.\nThat means no one earning under £60,000 will pay the charge, taking 170,000 families out of paying it altogether.\nAnd because of the higher taper and threshold, nearly half a million families with children will save an average of around £1300 next year.\n\nBut some families are set to lose out badly. For example, a couple with one parent earning £45,000 a year, and the other earning £40,000 a year currently qualify for child benefit at the full rate. Under the new system, where a household threshold, not an individual threshold applies, they would get nothing.\nAnd this change (the bit that saves the Treasury money) is not due to come into force until April next year, while the other changes (which cost the Treasury money) come into force this spring.\nIn his Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with Ed Balls, the former Tory chancellor George Osborne says this is a booby trap for the next government. He says:\n\nThis whole thing [of] ‘we’re going to have a brand new system for high earners in our country where we’re going to assess their entire household income in order to calculate this child benefit charge. We can’t do it now. But we’ll be bringing it in 2026’. That, I promise you, is a mine placed in the minefields for the future.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.43pm GMT\n\n\n 5.29pm GMT \n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility has trimmed its forecst for house price falls this year.\nThe OBR’s central forecast is for a 2% in average house prices in 2024, slightly under half of the 5% it expected in November. \nThis is mainly because the OBTR has revised down its forecast for mortgage rates in the next few years.\n\nThe average house price in the UK is forecast to fall to slightly under £275,000 in the final quarter of 2024. Supported by falling new mortgage rates, we then expect house prices to grow around 2 per cent in 2026, and around 3½ per cent in 2027 and 2028.\nThat would see nominal house prices surpass their historical peak in the first quarter of 2027.\n\n\n\nAs a result of mortgage rates gradually reducing, the @OBR_UK expect house prices to fall around 2% in 2024, a 3% improvement on their Nov prediction. By 2026 they predict house prices to grow around 2%, and then around 3½% in 2027 & 2028. \"That would see nominal house prices… pic.twitter.com/2BBHhBOhRU— Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) March 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.19pm GMT \nWhat opposition parties are saying about budget\n\nHere are some of the comments from opposition parties about the budget.\nFrom Labour’s Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor\n\nThe chancellor’s budget has lifted the lid on 14 years of Tory economic failure.\nTaxes are still rising, prices are still going up in the shops, and mortgages are higher.\nNothing Jeremy Hunt has said today changes that.

It couldn’t be clearer that we need a general election now so voters can finally kick this tired and out-of-touch government out of office.\n\nFrom Drew Hendry, the SNP’s economy spokesperson\n\nThe Tories trashed the economy, and now they’re taking the axe to public services - showing why it’s essential to vote SNP at the general election to make Scotland Tory-free and have the choice of a better future with independence.\nScotland’s budget has already been slashed by the UK government - and now they are cutting public services to the bone.\nWorse still, there is no alternative on offer from Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party, who support Brexit and want to impose the same damaging Tory fiscal plans, which will slash services and starve the economy of the investment needed to secure growth.\nThe UK economy is broken - and the damaging cuts in today’s budget will make it even worse by failing to properly invest in the green energy gold rush, choking off economic growth, and putting up to 100,000 jobs at risk in Scotland’s energy sector.\nWith the UK cost of living soaring, it’s a scandal that Tory tax breaks will benefit the richest most - with any benefit for working families completely wiped out by the cost of rising rents, mortgages, bills and food prices.\n\nFrom Carla Denyer, the Green party’s co-leader\n\nPeople are crying out for investment in social care, in our NHS and in dentistry. We needed a ‘care full’ budget but have ended up with a careless, reckless Budget. \nChancellor Jeremy Hunt is attempting to bribe the electorate through tax cuts, which can only mean more pain for public services that are already on their knees. \nPeople won’t be richer, healthier or happier because of this Budget.

Rather than tackling this long term weakness in the UK’s economy, the Chancellor prioritised the short term electoral fortune of the Government.\n\n\n\n\n 5.05pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 4.58pm GMT \nPensioners lose out in ‘sweet and sour’ budget, says Resolution Foundation\n\nThe Resolution Foundation says Hunt’s budget will leave “a sour taste” for whoever wins the next election, with £19bn of post-election tax rises and another £19bn of public service cuts inked in.\nThat takes away from the “pre-election sweetener” of further National Insurance rate cuts, taking total net personal tax cuts this election year to £8bn, Resolution say.\nThey also point out that the winners from today’s decisions are middle earners, while the cash losers are Britain’s eight million taxpaying pensioners...\nTorsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said:\n\n“The Chancellor has delivered a second dollop of pre-election tax cuts, borrowing more and taxing the likes of non doms, vapes and energy companies to do so.\n“When combined with big previously announced tax rises, this leaves a complex pattern of winners and losers. Middle earners make up the bulk of the former, while low or high earners will still see their taxes rise. \n“The biggest choice Jeremy Hunt made was to cut taxes for younger workers, while allowing taxes to rise for eight million pensioners. This is a staggering reversal of the approach taken by Conservative governments since 2010. It is undoubtedly good economics, even if the politics are a harder sell.\n“The tax cuts announced today to sweeten the Government’s election pitch rely on the prospect of a sour £19 billion of post-election tax rises, and the fiscal fiction that another £19 billion of cuts to public services can be delivered in a spending review that the Treasury today confirmed will not take place until after polling day.\n“For all that, the big picture has not changed at all with this Budget. Britain remains a country where taxes are heading up not down – rising by the equivalent of £3,900 per household – and where incomes are set to remain below their level at the last general election when voters return to the polls.”\n\n\n\nIt's not just taxes overall that are rising - it's personal taxes specifically.

It was 36.9% and it is going up to 40.3%. As this chart in the OBR report shows, the cuts to national insurance will only cut the tax-to-GDP ratio by about half as much as tax rises have put it up.\nThe report says:\n\nThe direct impact of major tax increases raises the tax take by 2.0 per cent of GDP. This includes the threshold freezes for income tax and NICs, which increases the tax take by 1.3 per cent of GDP, and the increase in the corporation tax rate from 19 to 25 per cent, which increases the tax take by 0.6 per cent of GDP. \nThe direct impact of major tax cuts reduces the tax take by 0.9 per cent of GDP. Personal tax cuts in the form of the reductions in (NICs) employee and self-employed main rates announced in November 2023 and in this budget reduce the tax take by 0.7 per cent of GDP. Corporate tax cuts in the form of the super-deduction announced in March 2021, the temporary full-expensing announced in March 2023, and the permanent full-expensing announced in the November 2023 reduce the tax take by a further 0.2 per cent of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n 4.42pm GMT \nOBR: Hitting military spending target would wipe out fiscal headroom\n\nThe government is on track to break its fiscal rule, if it pushes on with its plan to raise defence spending, the OBR says.\nThe watchdog was asked about the UK’s fiscal headroom at their press conference in London today, given various tax and spending challenges.\nThe OBR estimates that increasing military spending to 2.5% of GDP, from 2%, will cost £15bn-£16bn. That’s roughly double the remaining (rather small) fiscal headroom of £8.9bn that remains, before debt is not falling as a share of GDP in 2028-29.\nContinuing to freeze fuel duty (as happens every year since 2011), would cost around £4.5bn, or over half the remaining threshold (which is also subject to uncertainty, as small outcomes compared to the underlying forecasts would affect it).\nThere’s a third issue too – the financial markets’ expectations of interest rates in future have risen since the OBR’s forecasts were drawn up. Those movements would eat £3bn to £4bn out of the headroom.\n\n\n\n 4.33pm GMT \nHow national insurance cut will compensate some of Scotland's higher earners for extra income tax they pay\n\nJeremy Hunt’s decision to use national insurance rates as the vehicle for cutting employment taxes will cut the tax bill for Scottish workers by up to £1,330, but only partly offset higher tax policies being pursued by ministers in Edinburgh.\nThe chancellor’s measure could have greater political impact in Scotland than in other parts of the UK because it is the only UK-wide tax on jobs that he controls following the devolution of income tax rates to Scotland in 2016.\nIt allows the Scottish Tories to present their party as the only one lowering taxes at the next general election, but the key question is whether Scottish tax payers will be impressed or indifferent.\nThe Chartered Institute for Taxation has calculated that every Scot earning between £15,000 and £28,867 will benefit overall – their total tax bill will fall. But the effects over £28,867 will be mixed: their overall tax bill will still fall by more than it would have before Hunt cut NI, but for many, the Scottish wages tax bill will still remain higher. \nFor instance: someone in Scotland earning £35,000 will be £795 better off due to the NI cut, but will stay pay £61 more overall than someone in the rest of the UK because of the higher Scottish income tax rates. Someone earning £50,000 will be £1,320 better off due to the NI cut, but still pay £1,542 more overall.\nOnly the wealthiest affected by Scotland’s new highest income tax rate of 48p levied on those earning £125,140 or more, will still pay more from 6 April, ranging from a modest £550 a year to £9,300 a year more for those on £1m a year.\n\n\n\n 4.31pm GMT \nMoody's: Budget perpetuates UK's problems\n\nRatings agency Moody’s is not too impressed by today’s budget announcement.\nEvan Wohlmann, Moody’s lead analyst for the UK sovereign, says Hunt’s plans will ‘perpetuate’ the UK’s fiscal challenges.\nWohlmann also says the implied spending cuts after the election are “unlikely to materialise”, saying:\n\n“The UK chancellor’s announcement of pre-election tax cuts while maintaining restrained spending plans will perpetuate the UK’s fiscal challenges.\nThe government’s plans imply real spending cuts for unprotected departments which in Moody’s view are unlikely to materialise given long-term spending commitments on health and defence. Together with high interest costs, these pressures limit the UK’s flexibility to leverage fiscal policy to foster credit positive policymaking and create fiscal space to absorb shocks.\n\nThat rather echoes what the IMF warned in January:\n\n Related: IMF warns Jeremy Hunt against tax cuts in budget \n\nLast October, Moody’s lifted its outlook on the UK credit rating to ‘stable’, thanks to the restoration of policy predictability.\nAnd it seems unlikely to change that view soon.\nWohlmann says UK debt levels are on a par with the likes of France and Belgium:\n\nThat said, the government’s demonstrated commitment to set policy within its fiscal rules framework underpins the stable outlook on the UK’s Aa3 rating, with government debt projected to remain at around 100% of GDP in line with similarly rated peers such as France (Aa2 stable) and Belgium (Aa3 stable).”\n\n\nUpdated at 4.47pm GMT\n\n\n 4.23pm GMT \nHow almost 7m people will pay tax for first time, or join higher tax band, as result of 6-year allowance/threshold freeze\n\nThe OBR says that 3.7 million people will be brought into paying tax as a result of the freeze in the value of the personal allowance by 2028-29. And 3.2 million people will end up paying the higher rate (2.7 million) or the top rate (600,000) for the same reason, it says. \nThis effect is known as fiscal drag, and it has been particularly pronounced this decade because Rishi Sunak, when he was chancellor, said he was freezing allowances and threshold for four years from April 2022. Later Jeremy Hunt said the freeze would extend for another two years.\nHere is the chart in the OBR report showing the impact of these decisions.\n\n\n\n 4.11pm GMT \n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility has been presenting its economic and fiscal outlook to reporters in London.\nOBR chief Richard Hughes points out that four of the five years of its forecast are not based on any detailed plans from the government.\nThis is because the last spending review took place in October 2021, and another is not planned until after the election. All that we know is that the Treasury expect to raise day-to-day spending by 1% per year in real terms; while capital spending (CDEL) is broadly flat in cash terms.\nThat implies that total department expenditure limites (DELs) falls as a share of GDP by 1.0 percentage points over the final four years of the forecast, the OBR says – but it’s not clear how this will be achieved (some experts say its simply not plausible).\nBack in January, Hughes let rip with his frustration about this issue – telling MPs that forecasts on the outlook for the public finances were beyond “a work of fiction”.\n\n Related: Head of OBR says lack of budget details led to ‘work of fiction’ forecasts last year \n\n\n\n\n 4.03pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak has repeatedly said immigration is too high. But the OBR says that it has revised up its estimate for annual net migration over the next five years. In November it was assuming an annual figure of 290,000, but it has increased that figure to 350,000 (net migration per year, not total immigration).\nThe OBR says that, taking into account emigration, this suggests the adult UK population will grow by 300,000 over the next five years.\n\n\n\n 3.50pm GMT \nIFS: post-election spending plans look 'devilishly difficult to deliver'\n\nThe IFS also fear that the government’s plan to raise department spending by just 1% will require painful cuts to public services.\nPaul Johnson says:\n\nThe Chancellor left his provisional post-election spending plans effectively unchanged, despite reports that he would cut them back to ‘fund’ tax cuts.\nThose plans still look devilishly difficult to deliver. Sticking to them would require cuts to unprotected services (those not lucky enough to be covered by existing commitments and promises) of around 3.3% per year, under a plausible set of assumptions.\nThis compares to cuts of 6.1% per year to those areas between 2009–20 and 2014–15, and increases of 5.2% per year over this parliament. \n\n\n\n\n 3.45pm GMT \nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross says national insurance cut 'can't be stymied by SNP'\n\nJeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance rates by two percentage points for a second time has been “strongly supported” by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, because it is a Conservative party cut which offsets higher income tax rates levied by Scottish National party ministers in Edinburgh.The chancellor’s measure highlights a growing gulf in taxation policies between the two administrations.\nThe SNP and Green administration has used their devolved powers over income tax to slightly cut rates for those earning under £28,867 but increased them again for everyone earning above it, bringing in a new 45p “advanced” rate for salaries above £75,000 and raising the highest rate to 48p in the pound.\nThe Scottish Tories hope the national insurance cut will boost their chances of defending their seven Westminster seats at the general election.\nRoss said:\n\nA second national insurance cut in the space of four months is a huge boost to families and because national insurance is a reserved tax it can’t be stymied by the SNP.\nFreezing duty on fuel and whisky is another boost for hard-pressed Scots – particularly in rural areas, where people rely on their cars and many of our distilleries are based. The VAT cut for small businesses is equally good news.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.51pm GMT\n\n\n 3.40pm GMT \nIFS: Hunt taxes the smoke and mirrors Labour's plans\n\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is in witty mood as he analyses the budget:\n\n“We’ve learned to expect some degree of smoke and mirrors in the Budget. Today was no different, only on this occasion Mr Hunt decided to tax the smoke and to mirror the Labour party’s tax pledges on non-doms and North Sea oil.\nAlongside a new tax on vaping and an increase in tobacco duty, this was enough to allow Mr Hunt to announce another, well-trailed cut to National Insurance.\n\nJohnson welcomed the 2p cut in national insurance, which – when combined with the 2p cut from November’s Autumn Statement – means those on just above average earnings will gain around £1,000 a year.\nChanging the non-dom system, and reforming the child benefit tax credit, are also welcome, he says.\n\n\nRadical change this - allowing HMRC to collect household level information so as to reform high income child benefit charge.— Paul Johnson (@PJTheEconomist) March 6, 2024\n\n\nBut overall, Johnson says “this remains a parliament of record tax rises.”\nHe explains:\n\nSome bright spots, then, though the big picture on tax remains much the same. Come the election, tax revenues will be 3.9% of national income, or around £100 billion, higher than at the time of the last election. This remains a parliament of record tax rises.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.48pm GMT\n\n\n 3.40pm GMT \nTories challenge Labour to say what will happen to policies it planned to fund through tax measures Hunt has adopted\n\nGovernments don’t like performing U-turns, but for Jeremy Hunt there were two bonuses from lifting two of Labour’s tax plans; it funded his tax cuts, and might force Labour to drop some of its more attractive spending plans.\nTo emphasis this point, CCHQ has just sent a briefing note to journalists saying Labour must now explain whether it is going to abandon these policies, or find another way of funding them.\nThe Tories say these are the policies Labour was planning to fund with £1.6bn from the abolition of non-dom status.\n\nMore NHS appointments (£1.1bn per year)\nBreakfast clubs in schools (£186m per year)\nMore NHS equipment (£171m per year)\nMore NHS dental appointments (£111m per year)\n\nAnd the Tories says these are the policies that Labour plans to fund with £4.9bn from the extension of the windfall tax.\n\nHome insulation programme (£1.32bn a year)\nGreen-related jobs (£500m per year)\nSetting up GB Energy (£1.66bn a year)\nCreating a sovereign wealth fund (£1.46bn a year\n\nLabour is holding a briefing this afternoon, so we should get some sort of response then.\nThe Tories expect to raise more from the abolition of non-dom status than Labour said it expected to raise. But Labour’s version of the extension of the windfall tax is forecast to raise more than the Jeremy Hunt version, which he says will raise £1.5bn by 2029, and so not all the Labour revenue has been spent.\n\n\n\n 3.31pm GMT \n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, predicts that “the majority” of recent tax cuts may need to be reversed after the next election, to provide “adequate” public services levels:\n\nThe Government’s plans for the overall spending envelope imply that funding on unprotected departments would have to fall by over 3% a year in real terms, which is unrealistic in the absence of sustained productivity growth.\nThe majority of recent tax cuts may need to be reversed in the next Parliament in order to maintain an adequate provision of public services after the current Spending Review period.\n\n\n\nJeremy Hunt announced another round of tax cuts today - most notably another £10 billion cut to national insurance, just in time for the next election.

The most notable revenue raising measures he announced were around taxing on non-domiciled individuals, tobacco and vaping products, extending the energy profits levy and adjusting the Air Passenger Duty. \n“On balance though, this means that the Chancellor’s headroom at the end of the fiscal period is very limited and thus is dangerously close to breaking his own rules. The OBR expects around £9 billion of headroom to remain - if fuel duty remains frozen, this would get it down to £4.5 billion, which is virtually a rounding error. \n\nThe OBR point out that Hunt’s margin is much narrower than previous chancellors have judged wise:\n\n\nThe £8.9 billion margin in our central forecast against the debt falling target is lower than the average of £26.1 billion that Chancellors have set aside against their fiscal rules since 2010, and is a small fraction of the risks around any fiscal forecast.#Budget2024 pic.twitter.com/OEHaW4nZ9Y— Office for Budget Responsibility (@OBR_UK) March 6, 2024\n\n\nMichael Saunders, the former Bank of England policymaker who is now senior economic advisor at the consultancy Oxford Economics, points out that the current forecasts are based on \"“fiscal fantasies” – including that fuel duty will rise.\nSaunders says:\n\nOn paper, the Chancellor will just about meet his fiscal rules, and the OBR forecast that the public debt/GDP ratio will fall in five years. But these forecasts rest on fiscal fantasies. They assume that petrol taxes will rise in line with inflation, even though the government has decided against doing that for fourteen consecutive years.\n What’s more, they assume that the government will deliver a painful public spending squeeze – with little or no growth in real spending per head in the next few years – even though it lacks any credible plans to achieve this. The government has learnt to game the OBR framework by pencilling in future fiscal restraint without appearing to be serious about delivering it.\n\n\n\n\n 3.18pm GMT \nHouseholds still £870 worse off on average, Labour claims, because NI cuts don't compensate for freezing allowances\n\nLabour claims that, despite the cut in national insurance in the budget, households are still £870 worse off on average as a result of the tax measures taken by the Tories. Labour has calculated this figure on the basis that the cuts worth £21.4bn (by 2028-29) need to seen alongside the the impact of the extra £41.1bn raised by the freeze in thresholds and allowances for tax and national insurace.\nThose two figures from from this chart in the OBR’s report.\n\nUpdated at 3.29pm GMT\n\n\n 3.04pm GMT \nVaping tax could double cost of highest nicotine products\n\nThe government’s planned tax on vaping liquids could double the cost of the strongest e-liquids from 2026.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility say they expect it will raise £500m per year by the 2028-29 financial year, although there are “several uncertainties in the costing”.\nThe OBR explains:\n\nThe new tax applies a specified fixed amount of duty to a defined quantity of e-liquid and will be charged to UK manufacturers or importers. There are three rates that are differentiated according to the amount of nicotine content in the e-liquid.\nIt means that a vaping product that falls within the highest nicotine category and currently retailing at £3.00 (for 10 millilitres of e-liquid) will be subject to a £3.00 rate of duty (in 2026-27), raising its post-tax price to £6.60 (since we assume all of the duty will be passed through to consumers).\n\n\n\nVape e-liquid prices are to go up by as much as £3 depending on nicotine contentPrice changes to 10ml e-liquid bottle:✴️Nicotine-free - £1 increase✴️0.1-10.9mg nicotine - £2 increase✴️11mg or more of nicotine - £3 increasehttps://t.co/LlaPSL0dyM— Sophie Huskisson (@soph_husk) March 6, 2024\n\n\nThe budget documents released by the Treasury have more details:\n\nThe government will introduce a new duty on vaping products from 1 October 2026, with registrations for the duty opening from 1 April 2026. \nThe rates will be £1.00 per 10ml for nicotine free liquids, £2.00 per 10ml on liquids that contain 0.1-10.9 mg nicotine per ml, and £3.00 per 10ml on liquids that contain 11mg or more per ml.

In so far as there was a “rabbit”, it was “the abolition of national insurance”.\nThis is what Hunt said about employee national insurance, and about the fact that it in effect duplicates income tax.\n\nThis is the second fiscal event where we have reduced employee and self-employed national insurance.\nWe have cut it by one third in six months without increasing borrowing and without cutting spending on public services. That means the average earner in the UK now has the lowest effective personal tax rate since 1975 – and one that is lower than in America, France, Germany or any G7 country.”\nBecause Conservatives believe that making work pay is of the most fundamental importance, because we believe that the double taxation of work is unfair, our long-term ambition is to end this unfairness.\n\nThe Telegraph’s website currently has “Hunt signals the end of national insurance” as its lead headline on its budget coverage.\nBut the end of national insurance seems unlikely. According to the budget red book, the Treasury raises £168bn from national insurance contributions. This figure includes the revenue from employer national insurance contributions, but that is still a huge amount of money that would have be funded by cuts or “productivity savings” in the public sector.\n\nUpdated at 3.03pm GMT\n\n\n 2.42pm GMT \nExperts voice doubts about Brit ISA\n\nHunt’s plan for a British ISA is getting a rather lukewarm reaction from the City.\nAs covered at 1.02pm, it will give savers an extra £5,000 tax free allowance, to be spent on UK assetts. That’s on top of the £20,000 you’re allowed to put into your ISA each year.\nClaire Trott, divisional director of retirement and holistic planning at wealth manager St. James’s Place, fears that a British ISA will create more complexity.\nTrott says:\n\n“We welcome all opportunities for tax free investment with the ‘British ISA’ increasing the overall ISA allowance. However, it comes with restrictions on where you can invest which may be a turn off for some.\nIt also adds to the complexity of something that used to be simple, we now have multiple ISAs with various restrictions, which will probably mean more need for financial advice.”\n\nNimesh Shah, CEO of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, also has questions:\n\nIntroduction of the British ISA could give someone up to £26k in ISA savings per annum if they are also eligible for the Lifetime ISA.\nI question whether we need another form of ISA - wouldn’t it have been easier to increase the £20k ISA allowance which has remained stuck at this level since 2017/18.\n\nBloomberg’s Merryn Somerset Webb points out that few people manage to put aside £20,000 each year (in this economy?!), so it’s a symbolic gesture really:\n\n\nOnly around 15% of ISA investors use full allowance at moment so the new Brit ISA coming on top is as much symbolic as anything.

Along with Brexit, the so-called Jurassic Park FTSE 100 has suffered from a heavy lack of exciting new tech success stories, in stark contrast to US markets where tech giants from Silicon Valley have largely been responsible for the major outperformance stateside.\n\n\n\n\n 2.36pm GMT \nWhat you need to know about the new economic forecasts\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility have released a video to explain their new forecasts.\n\n\nRichard Hughes explains five things you need to know about our forecast#Budget2024 pic.twitter.com/mTcS9T1f6y— Office for Budget Responsibility (@OBR_UK) March 6, 2024\n\n\nKey points include:\n\nInflation has fallen faster than expected, and should drop below the UK’s 2% target later this year.\nMarkets expect interest rates to fall faster.\nThe medium-term outlook for growth is little changed, compared to November, partly due to higher economic inactivity.\nThe fiscal forecast is also little changed – lower inflation means that debt servicing costs are lower than expected, but also means lower growth from tax revenues\nThis has given the chancellor a net fiscal boost of £10bn per year over the next two years, but borrowing is largely unchanged by the end of the forecast period.\n\nOBR chief Richard Hughes says:\n\nIn his spring budget, the chancellor spends all of this windfall on another 2p cut to national insurance, and another freeze in fuel duty, whose cost is partly recouped by new taxes on vapes, carbon imports and non-doms.\n\nThere are no significant changes to the planned level of spending on public services, Hughes adds:\n\n\n\n 2.20pm GMT \nSunak faces rebellion from Scottish Tory MPs over plan to extend windfall tax\n\nJeremy Hunt faces a rebellion from Scottish Tory MPs over his decision to extend the windfall tax on energy profits until 2029, with one energy minister, Andrew Bowie, reportedly considering resignation.\nThe chancellor has been under intense pressure to end the levy from vulnerable Scottish Tories, including Douglas Ross, the party’s Scottish leader and the MP for Moray, a north-east seat close to Aberdeen, the UK’s oil and gas industry capital.\nRoss confirmed he will not vote for the measure, even though Hunt did listen to his pleas for a second cut to national insurance rates – a move which benefits Scottish employees who pay higher income tax rates levied by ministers Holyrood. (See 12.01pm.)\nThe Tories are defending three Westminster seats in north east Scotland at the next general election, including Bowie’s seat in West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, which he holds with a wafer thin 843-vote majority over the Scottish National party.\nWith Scottish opinion polls putting them as low as 15%, the Scottish Tories believe championing North Sea oil and gas jobs is their strongest suit – a position undermined by Hunt’s decision to extend the levy.\nTo their embarrassment, the Scottish Tories also have an opposition day debate at Holyrood later on Wednesday on the sector. It was intended to highlight Rishi Sunak’s boast at the Scottish Tories’ conference in Aberdeen last Friday “we have consistently been the only major party that has backed the North Sea oil and gas industry.”\n\n\n\n 2.13pm GMT \n\nStarmer accuses the government of ducking its responsibility to the victims of the infected blood and Horizon IT scandals.\nChaos is the Tories’ world view, he says. They see Britain’s problems as an opportunity to exploit.\nHe says they have left the UK a nation in limbo, and “maxed out the nation’s credit card”.\nBritain needs an alternative government, he says. And he ends challenging Sunak to call a general election on 2 May.\n\n\n\n 2.10pm GMT \n\nStarmer says it is only the record levels of immigration that have prevented an even deeper decline.\nThat is all the government has to promote growth, he says.\nThere is no ambition for cheaper, greener power, and no inclination to strenghten employment rights.\nAnd where is the urgency on housing, he asks. \nStarmer says Hunt has been taking lesssons in marketing from the Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow.\n\n\n\n 2.07pm GMT \nTax as a share of GDP to hit the highest level since 1948\n\nThe UK tax burden is heading towards its highest level since Clement Attlee was prime minister, when Britain was starting to pay down its war debts.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility reports that tax as a share of GDP will fall slightly this year (due to the cut in national insurance in January).\nBut it then rises gradually in every year of its forecast, rising to 37.1% of GDP in 2028-29.\nThat, the OBR says, which would be the highest level since 1948, and four percentage points above the pre-pandemic level of 33.1% of GDP in 2019-20.\n\n\nAre taxes going up or down? Up, still rising to 37% of GDP in 2028-29 = highest level since 1948 pic.twitter.com/JdNFaAHxbg— Torsten Bell (@TorstenBell) March 6, 2024\n\n\nThis rather clashes with the Treasury’s claim that the chancellor is “delivering lower taxes”.\nBut it’s a lower figure than last November, when the OBR forecast the tax take would hit a post-war high of 37.7% of GDP by 2028-29.\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm GMT\n\n\n 2.07pm GMT \n\nStarmer accuses the government of complacency. Britain deserves better than 14 years of stagntion, he says.\nBut all it got was the same old formula, party first and country second.\nHe says Hunt said the UK had grown more quickly than countries like Germany over the past 14 year.\nIn per capita terms, the figures are different. The UK has not grown in per capita terms since the first quarter of 2022, he says.\n\n\n\n 2.05pm GMT \nStarmer says Labour supports cut to national insurance in budget\n\nStarmer confirms that Labour supports the cut to national insurance.\nBut he points out that Rishi Sunak, as chancellor, promised the basic rate of income tax would be cut in 2024.\nAnd, on the NHS, he says Jeremy Hunt as health secretary promised a paperless NHS by 2018.\n\nUpdated at 2.06pm GMT\n\n\n 2.03pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons Starmer says the Tories have finally accepted Labour’s idea on non-doms. Has there ever been a better example of a party bereft of ideas?\nAnd why did they do not it earlier?\nIf they had, there would have been more than 3m hospital operations, and 1.3m more dental appointments, he says.\nAnd he tells Tory MPs that they should get used to these U-turns. It won’t be long before government asks them to back VAT on private school fees, he says.\n\n\n\n 1.59pm GMT \n\nStarmer says the story of this parliament is simple: a Conservative party clinging to the ideas of the past, and unable to generate growth.\nHe says the Tories have torched their reputation for fiscal responsibility, and any suggestion they will put the country first.\nPeople are paying higher mortgages because of the Liz Truss mini-budget, he says.\nAnd will recognise this as a con, he says.\nAnd a “Tory stealth tax is coming their way in the form of a higher council tax bill”.\n\nUpdated at 2.06pm GMT\n\n\n 1.56pm GMT \nStarmer describes budget as 'last, desperate act of party that has failed'\n\nThe division is over. The government won by 288 votes to 38.\nKeir Starmer is now speaking.\nHe starts by referring to the budget as “the last, desperate act of a party that has failed”.\n\n\n\n 1.53pm GMT \nOBR: Medium-term outlook remains challenging\n\nAs Hunt sat down, the Office for Budget Responsibility released its latest assessment of the UK economy – its Economic and Fiscal Outlook.\nThe OBR starts by saying that the UK’s near-term growth prospects have improved, thanks to inflation falling faster than it expected in November. That has led markets to expect a sharper decline in interest rates.\nThe OBR says:\n\nThis strengthens near-term growth prospects and should enable a faster recovery in living standards from last financial year’s record decline.\n\n\n\nLower inflation and policies in #Budget2024 help living standards to recover to their pre-pandemic peak two years earlier than expected in our November forecast. pic.twitter.com/IGLKIHxlT8— Office for Budget Responsibility (@OBR_UK) March 6, 2024\n\n\nBut the medium-term economic outlook “remains challenging”, the fiscal watchdog warns.\nThe OBR has lifted its estimate for the current UK population, following the 2021 Census and net migration since then. But, it also sees rising economic inactivity (more people are unable to work due too ill health).\nAnd that means the economy, as a share of the population, is expected to be slightly smaller than expected in November. That means even worse living standards:\nThe OBR says:\n\nOne of the biggest changes to our economy forecast is an increase in the size and growth of the UK population. But higher and rising levels of inactivity offset its impact on the overall size of the workforce, leaving our forecast for the level of GDP in five years virtually unchanged from the autumn, and the level of GDP per person slightly lower.\n\n\n\nGDP growth in 2023 was weaker than expected in our November EFO. But lower forecast energy prices and interest rates support slightly stronger growth over the next few years, leaving the level of GDP largely unchanged by 2028 relative to our last forecast.#Budget2024 pic.twitter.com/6MucV5Iiui— Office for Budget Responsibility (@OBR_UK) March 6, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.10pm GMT\n\n\n 1.51pm GMT \n\nHere is the Treasury’s news release about the budget.\n\n\n\n 1.47pm GMT \nBudget debate held up after SNP MPs force surprise vote on its provisions\n\nEleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, is now calling a vote on certain budget measures (taxes that come into force tonight) that have to go through as soon as the budget speech is over. Normally this is down by acclamation (government MPs shouting aye), so that the Commons can get on with listening to the opposition’s response. But some MPs have forced a division (by shouting no), and there is a vote.\nIt seems to have been the SNP who were forcing a division.\nAfter the speaker ignored Commons rules in a way that led to MPs not getting a vote on their Gaza motion last month, they have been talking about using more disruptive tactics at Westminster.\nThe division will take about 15 minutes, and then Keir Starmer will get a chance to respond to the budget.\n\n\n\n 1.41pm GMT \nHunt confirms 2p cut in national insurance, claiming average personal taxes now at lowest level since 1975\n\nHunt is now talking about national insurance.\nFrom April employee national insurance will be cut from 10% to 8%, and self-employed NICS from 8% to 6%.\nHe says, combined with the changes announced in the autumn statement, 27 million people will gain £900. And 2 million self-employed people will gain £650.\nHe says the OBR says this will put 200,000 more people in work. And it will increase GDP by 0.4%, he says.\nHe says this will bring personal taxes to their lowest level since 1975. \nAnd he says the Conservatives will continue to keep cutting national insurance.\n(There is a big difference between personal taxes and the overall tax burden. In 1975 VAT had only just been introduced, and it was levied at 10%. It is double that rate now.)\n\n\n\n 1.35pm GMT \nHunt says 500,00 families will gain almost £1,300 from increase in high income threshold for child benefit\n\nHunt says he will change the way child benefit is paid.\nAt the moment the high income threshold applies to individuals, not households. That will change, he says.\nAnd he says he is also increasing the higher income threshold. It will go up from £50,000 to £60,000.\nHe claims that almost half a million families will gain by almost £1,300.\n\n\nWe’re increasing the threshold at which parents start paying the High Income Child Benefit Charge, from £50,000 to £60,000.Making almost half a million families better off by an average of almost £1300 per household. pic.twitter.com/GkFPO0va7p— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.34pm GMT \n\nHunt’s decision to abolish non-dom status means Labour need to find another way to provide extra funding for the NHS (as Hunt says he is using the money to cut taxes for working people), points out Sky’s News’s Sophie Ridge.\n\n\nJeremy Hunt confirms the Gvt will abolish the current tax system for non domsWhich means Labour needs to find another way of paying for extra investment in the NHS https://t.co/izQWwjmPYN— Sophy Ridge (@SophyRidgeSky) March 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.31pm GMT \nHunt says he will raise £2.7bn by abolishing non-dom status\n\nHunt is now talking about abolishing non-dom status.\nHe claims Labour was only interested in this because it was a plan Nigel Lawson originally favoured.\nHe confirms that he will abolish non-dom status.

How can victims have confidence in the system?\nSunak says the rape action review plan is showing considerable progress. Sentences for rape have increased by a third, under a power that Labour voted against. Last year there was a 50% increase in rape charges, he says. And he says while Starmer was at the CPS rape convictions fell.\n\n\n\n 12.09pm GMT \n\nStarmer says there is a world of difference between a code, and binding national standards.

That’s because the speaker will also choose people not on the list, to ensure questions come in the government/opposition/government/opposition order. \nOn Monday George Galloway said he would try to get a question in today.

The Financial Times has some detail about how Hunt will do this. It says:\n\nThe chancellor is looking to scrap the two-century old concept of domicile, and change when individuals receive the tax break, the Financial Times has been told. The Treasury declined to comment. \nNon-domiciled people are UK residents deemed to have their permanent home or “domicile” outside the country. They can currently earn money from abroad without paying UK tax on this for up to 15 years, provided they do not bring any income or capital gains into the country. \nHunt will modernise the system, replacing the concept of domicile in tax with a statutory residence test that would define who benefits from a new system of tax privileges. \nHe will also encourage wealthy people to bring their foreign-held assets and money to the UK. Tax experts have long complained the current regime is complicated and disincentivises non-doms from bringing wealth into the country, as they are taxed when they do so.\n\nDarren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has described this as a “humiliating U-turn”.\n\n\n'Are they really in a position where they're so bereft of any ideas of their own?'Labour's @darrenpjones says if Jeremy Hunt announces he's scrapping the non-dom tax status in the Budget, it will be a 'humiliating u-turn for the Conservatives' pic.twitter.com/UEhRfscpKR— ITV News Politics (@ITVNewsPolitics) March 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.37am GMT \n\nJeremy Hunt is expected to extend the windfall tax on energy companies in the budget to help fund his national insurance cut. Extending the windfall tax is a Labour proposal that the Tories used to dismiss, and, according to a Daily Telegraph story, Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, is so angry about the move that colleagues thought he might resign. Ross is MP for Moray, in the north-east of Scotland, and he is worried that the potential impact on the oil and gas industry in Scotland will cost the party votes.\nIn their story, Nick Gutteridge, Dominic Penna and Simon Johnson say Ross had a row with Rishi Sunak about this at a reception on Sunday night. They report:\n\nThe leader of the Scottish Conservatives had doggedly sought out Mr Sunak across the crowded, stifling room, determined to give him a piece of his mind about the Treasury’s plans to extend the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas giants for an extra year.\nWhat followed was a “heated” discussion between the pair, with Mr Ross warning the move would hammer the Tory vote north of the border and the prime minister countering that it was necessary to deliver a National Insurance cut for millions of workers.\nA clearly dissatisfied Mr Ross then sought out Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, and delivered a last-ditch plea to him to drop the measure from Wednesday’s budget. While his demands ultimately fell on deaf ears, they prompted severe unease in Downing Street.\nNo 10 began to fear that their party’s Scottish leader was planning to resign in protest at the decision – a move that would have gone down well with core Tory voters in Aberdeenshire, but would have been a disastrous display of disunity on budget day.\n\n\n\n\n 11.25am GMT \n\nNormally the shadow chancellor would respond to a Commons statement by the chancellor, but on budget day parliamentary convention means that the leader of the opposition has to do it. Luckily, this is a task Keir Starmer has been preparing for. In his new biography of Starmer (which is excellent – I’ll write about it at more length on another day), Tom Baldwin quotes Starmer aide Chris Ward as saying that soon after Starmer became an MP in 2015 he started thinking about what he would do on days like today. “We’d book afternoons out to practise. There would be a budget and I’d say to him, one day you might have to respond to this, so we’d sit down, go through the Treasury’s figures together, and work out what he would have done if he had been leader,” Ward told Baldwin.\nToday’s budget has been drafted to hobble Labour as much as possible. In a good article for Politico, Esther Webber explains that there is a long history of chancellors acting like this. She says:\n\nGlen O’Hara, professor of modern history at Oxford Brookes University, points to the gaping trade deficit left for Labour in 1964, when outgoing Tory Chancellor Reginald Maudling infamously left a note for his successor reading: “Good luck, old cock … sorry to leave it in such a mess.” \nConservative Chancellor Norman Lamont’s pre-election budget in 1992 introduced a lower rate of income tax which Labour opposed, allowing the Tories to portray them as a “high-tax party.” The Tories unexpectedly went on to win the subsequent poll. \nJill Rutter, who worked in the Treasury alongside Lamont — and is now part of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank — confirms that “at the time, they all thought they were being super clever in terms of making life difficult for Labour.”\nShe cites more recent examples, too, including former Labour PM Gordon Brown’s introduction of a child poverty target just before the 2010 election — hard for any government not to honor, without appearing monstrous — and Osborne’s own austerity spending cuts ahead of the 2015 election, which proved difficult for Labour to undo without being cast as big spenders. \n\n\n\n\n 11.05am GMT \n\nJeremy Hunt has been posing for the traditional budget day photographs outside No 11 with his red box.\n\n\n\n 10.56am GMT \nHow taxes go down and up before and after general elections\n\nThere is a long history of governing parties cutting taxes in budgets just before general elections, and new governments (often from the same party) whacking them up again in the first budget after polling day. Jeremy Hunt is obviously in election bribe mode today, but this chart, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, which covers fiscal events up to last year’s autumn statement, suggests that what he is doing is not unprecedented. Denis Healey did something similar before the 1979 election, which Labour lost, and Geoffrey Howe before 1983, which the Tories won.\n\n\n\n 10.41am GMT \n\nJeremy Hunt has been talking about “great budgets” this morning. He did not quite say today’s would be in the list, but in a video broadcast on X this morning, the chancellor said:\n\nGreat budgets change history. The bit of history I want to change is to show people it is possible, if we stick to a plan through all the ups and downs, through all the challenges, it’s possible to have healthy growth, good public services, and to bring down taxes.\n\nReminder: the economy is in recession, polls suggest 80% of people think public services are in a fairly bad or very bad state, and at the autumn statement the OBR said taxes as a share of GDP were forecast to reach a postwar high in 2028-29.\n\n\nWe’re sticking to the plan. pic.twitter.com/kJefyMKndc— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 6, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.42am GMT\n\n\n 10.16am GMT \n\nJeremy Hunt told colleagues what was in the budget at an early morning cabinet meeting, and some of them seemed pretty cheerful as they were photographed on the way out. They don’t always emerge from cabinet smiling like this. Perhaps they were told to look positive, or maybe they were just pleased by what they heard.\n\n\n\n 10.04am GMT \n\nThere has been a lot of commentary (eg here) over the last 24 hours about how cutting national insurance by 2p in the pound is unlikely to help the Tories because they tried that in the autumn statement and their poll ratings have not budged. But, as Stephen Bush points out in his Inside Politics briefing for the Financial Times, this argument ignores an important factor motivating Rishi Sunak. Bush says:\n\nSo how successful was the 2p tax cut? In terms of the Conservative-Labour battle, not at all. Since the last fiscal statement, the polls have if anything worsened for the Conservative party. On Monday, polling by Ipsos put Tory support at 20 per cent, the lowest level since its survey began in 1978. The Conservatives have lost three by-elections on the bounce. But in terms of the internal battle within the Tory party, the national insurance cut has done its job, in that Rishi Sunak is still prime minister.\nThat’s the important political context to understand when Hunt will essentially try to do the same thing with a further 2p cut in national insurance. He will also hope that scrapping the “non-dom” tax regime will cause problems for Labour.\nOn that last aim, he will surely get at least some joy: scrapping the “non-dom” regime is one of Labour’s few tax rises and it is intended to fund many of their promises. Whatever alternative the party rustles up instead may be unpopular or unworkable or both. As far as the country as a whole is concerned, cutting national insurance did not move the dial in November and I doubt it is going to do so in March. And a Budget that doesn’t move the dial may, in the end, fail in its other aim of protecting Sunak from internal revolt.\n\n\n\n\n 9.48am GMT \n\nHarriett Baldwin, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, told LBC this morning that she “definitely” wants to see an increase in defence spending in the budget. That is also the view of Conservative party members, according to a survey by the ConservativeHome website published yesterday. It is assumed that Tory members want tax cuts above all, but the survey suggests that 74% of them think higher defence spending is more important. They said Jeremy Hunt should increase the defence budget “even if it leaves less room for tax cuts”.\n\nUpdated at 10.26am GMT\n\n\n 9.41am GMT \nUK fuel duty cut is regressive policy that benefits the wealthy, study finds\n\nRetaining the fuel duty cut in the budget is a regressive policy that benefits the wealthiest in society, who will save £60 a year, while those who earn the least will save just £22, according to analysis.

Looking at some of the newspaper front pages this morning, you might assume that it’s all done, and that today’s budget is a “good news” event for the Conservative party (which is in such a dire plight it may have forgotten what good news is).\n\n\nWednesday's DAILY EXPRESS: Hunt's tax cut gamble will put £900 in workers' pockets#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/m1aDPJoZ7O— Jack Surfleet (@jacksurfleet) March 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\nWednesday's DAILY TELEGRAPH: Tax cuts spark election talk#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/owfocEnPM0— Jack Surfleet (@jacksurfleet) March 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\nWednesday's TIMES: Hunt looks to win over voters with £900 tax cut#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/VxsbZmJIcP— Jack Surfleet (@jacksurfleet) March 5, 2024\n\n\nFrom what we know, it seems as if Jeremy Hunt is going to test the “election bribe” approach to politics to destruction with a giveaway budget that he hopes will revive his party’s fortunes by anaesthetising memory of the very large tax increases the government has already imposed since 2019, and setting a campaign trap for Labour.\nBut there are three big questions yet to be answered.\nFirst, is a 2p cut in national insurance the main story of the budget, or is there something much bigger to come? The 2p cut is now established as fact, but it is not entirely clear whether that is because the Treasury wanted the news out before the budget, or whether it was just forced into confirming what diligent reporting had uncovered. Budgets normally focus on tax changes taking effect in the budget year. But Rishi Sunak is also on record as wanting to cut income tax eventually to 16p in the pound, and sometimes chancellors announce tax cuts they plan to make a year or more in advance. Will we get some of that today?\nSecond, how will Labour react? Hunt will probably fund his tax cut by lifting two of the four tax increases proposed by Labour (which the Tories used to oppose) and by cutting plans for public spending after the election. Many in the Labour party would love to see Starmer promise to reverse any such cuts when he responds to the budget statement. But Starmer wants to fight the general election on terms set by Labour, not Hunt, and so he is unlikely to leap into such an obvious elephant trap. We might not get the full, considered Labour response today, but we will find out in what direction they are heading.\nThe final question is, if this is the most nakedly partisan budget of recent times, will it work? We certainly won’t know for sure today, but by 6pm we might be better placed to have a guess.\nHere is our overnight story on the budget by Kiran Stacey, Pippa Crerar and Phillip Inman.\n\n Related: Jeremy Hunt defies public services alarm with pre-election budget tax cuts \n\nAnd here is Phillip’s guide to what to expect from the budget.\n\n Related: What to expect from Jeremy Hunt’s spring budget \n\nMy colleague Graeme Wearden will be joining me later from the business blog, and we will be covering the budget in full, and then focusing on reaction and analysis.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n8.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet, where Jeremy Hunt will brief ministers on what’s in the budget.\n12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\n12.30pm: Hunt delivers his budget statement in the Commons. The speech will last about an hour, and when it finishes the budget red book, the Office for Budget Responsibility’s analysis, and all the other budget documentation will be published on the Treasury and OBR websites.\n2.30pm: Richard Hughes, chair of the OBR, holds a press conference.\n5pm: Hunt addresses a meeting of the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "The northern mayors can certainly become part of a regional renaissance (Editorial, 3 March), but there are some big issues that need to be addressed if the north is to really benefit. First, there’s a big democratic deficit in the city-region model of governance. One person is elected mayor, but without being part of a team of elected councillors (unlike the old Greater Manchester county council, abolished by Thatcher). All we have is an indirect accountability through the district leaders. It’s not good enough. Second, the areas covered by the city-region mayors only include parts of the north. Areas such as east Lancashire, with large and economically deprived towns including Burnley and Accrington, are not in the city region. Finally, there is an issue of identity with the city regions, outside the cities themselves. In your editorial you referred to Andy Burnham being “in Manchester”, though elsewhere you credit him as being the mayor of Greater Manchester, which has 10 large districts including my own town of Bolton, historically a proud Lancashire town. Bolton has never been comfortable being part of anything calling itself Greater Manchester. Why not extend the present Greater Manchester to take in much of the historic Lancashire to create a powerful county region (with or without Liverpool city region) – a Greater Lancastria, with a mayor working with democratically elected representatives, and strong devolved powers to put us on a par with Scotland and Wales?Prof Paul SalvesonBolton, Greater Manchester • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Was that it? Was that really it? Everything pre-briefed. No surprises whatsoever. Two percentage points off national insurance. Is that what you think my vote is worth? Because it worked so well when you knocked two percentage points off NI in last year’s autumn statement. That really shifted the polls. But hey, they say insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting a different result.  So let me bask in the giveaway you think will make up for all the damage the government has done over the last 14 years. Feeling good? Thought not. Everything about this budget was always going to be a total fiction. And it didn’t disappoint. Here we have a budget that was going to cut the overall tax burden, said the chancellor. Except it isn’t. Check through the small print and you will find that the Office for Budget Responsibility reckons the overall tax rate is at its highest since 1948. Every fiscal assumption that Jeremy Hunt has made is based on taxes going up. But let’s just run with the alternative reality. Take the same drugs that Jezza injects to get through the day. Just for the hell of it. After all, we aren’t going to have too much more of the Tories, so we might as well enjoy them while we can.  Here’s how it works. You’re just going to love the tax cut that means your taxes won’t be going up by quite so much as they otherwise might. I mean, it’s not as if the NHS and the transport system aren’t on their knees. Far better you get that extra 2p than someone bothers to care for your mother with Alzheimer’s. Old people are such a waste of space. That’s just the start. Because the government also doesn’t want you to know that your council tax will be going up by a minimum of 5%, to go a small way to providing the services that the Treasury aren’t interested in. Funny that that bit of the tax burden never got a mention. Which leaves growth. Hunt somehow failed to mention he can only get to a positive outcome by allowing more people into the country. At the same time as the Tories are trying to break international law by offloading planeloads of refugees to Rwanda. Go figure. Because Rishi Sunak can’t. It’s just a shame that for such an elaborate fiction, we have in Jezza such a piss-poor storyteller. Remember that he was only ever drafted in as chancellor out of desperation. When Hunt was the last man standing. The only Tory who looked as if he could vaguely reassure the country after the deranged 49 days of Liz Truss. He sort of looked safe. Someone unthreatening, if a bit useless. The sort of person you wouldn’t mind marrying your best friend’s daughter. Though preferably not your own. You would hope for more for your own child. Then Sunak took over and found himself lumbered with Jezza. Partly because there was a yawning lack of talent in his party, but also because further change would look like even greater chaos. So Hunt got off to a slow start and has now almost ground to a halt. There is literally nothing to him. He has less grasp of economics than my dog. The country’s finances are being run by a halfwit. Sajid Javid sat through the budget speech with his face distorted into Munch’s The Scream. He looked as if he had taken an overdose of fentanyl. For what would certainly be his last ever budget, Jezza had invited one of his sons to watch from the gallery. This could be construed as child abuse. It would be one of the longest, most painful 80 minutes in all our lives. There was no form, no order, no real conviction. It was as though someone had rustled up a bundle of papers and reassembled them in a random order. At least, that’s the only reasonable explanation for why Jezza sounded so confused He simply had no idea what was going on. “This is a budget for long-term growth,” Hunt began. He seemed to forget that was how he had started his last budget statement, and that we are now in recession. So he was immediately setting the bar low.   Related: ‘We all know how her show ends’: Jeremy Hunt’s worst budget day jokes    He rambled his way unconvincingly through a screed of numbers that turned out to be entirely imaginary. It was like being given access to a remedial reading class. He then committed a more obvious blunder: he froze fuel duty again, having said six months ago that the only way he could meet his fantasy fiscal rules was by raising fuel duty. He must think we are as stupid as he is. Initially there was some sympathetic encouragement from the Tory MPs. He may be a total loser, but he was their total loser. The best they had. But gradually, a deathly silence prevailed as they realised they had just run out of luck in the Last Chance Saloon. Sunak appeared to be in agony. His face a vision of despair. Michelle Donelan looked around, searching for someone to libel. Only Victoria Atkins roared her full-throated approval. But then, it’s not entirely clear if the health secretary ever really knows what is happening. Most of the noise came from the Labour benches. They hadn’t had so much fun in years. “Can you shout more quietly?” said the deputy speaker, Eleanor Laing. The final humiliation came when Jezza tried to pretend that doing away with non-dom status was entirely his own idea and not a deliberate attempt to steal Labour’s flagship policy. To make it harder for an incoming Starmer government. Not that Hunt really knew what he would do with the money he raised. Waste it, probably. Rish! nodded this one through. Hopefully he made sure that his wife had all her tax affairs in order before signing that one off. At last Jezza reached the final page and could sit down. It was over. For ever. He could at least console himself that his budget was unlikely to fall apart within a matter of hours. Mainly because there was so little to unravel. Every underwhelming detail had already been priced in. Everyone knew it was bollocks. The country that Hunt had described, in which everything had never been better, was one that was unrecognisable to everyone else. Jezza was no saviour rising from the street. If this was an election budget, then the election is lost."

        "content": "It is one of the more peculiar traditions of the budget: the fact that the chancellor, always one of the less flamboyant ministers in the cabinet, is meant to pepper their lengthy, data-laden speech with jokes.\nSome do it better than others. Philip Hammond had an undeniable, if deadpan sense of timing, while Rishi Sunak sometimes gave the impression that he didn’t quite know what a joke was. Jeremy Hunt falls somewhere between – enthusiastic, but not a natural. Here are some of his jokes from Wednesday’s budget, from the obvious to the obscure.\nAngela Rayner and capital gains tax\nIntroducing a cut to the rate of capital gains tax paid by higher-rate taxpayers when selling second homes, Hunt delighted the Conservative benches, and seemingly himself, by saying: “I see the deputy leader of the Labour party paying close attention, given her multiple dwellings.”\nThis is a reference to reports, mainly in government-friendly newspapers, suggesting that Rayner might have been liable to pay capital gains tax on the sale of her former council house before she became an MP.\nLess a joke than a chance to cheer up Tory MPs by letting them laugh at an opponent’s political misfortune, but no less effective for that.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Laffer curve\nPerhaps only a chancellor should be allowed to use a theory about optimal tax rates as a punchline to a joke, and even then only if it is delivered well. Hunt perhaps limped over the line on this front.\nIntroducing the capital gains tax plan, Hunt said the Treasury and Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believed a lower rate would bring in more revenue, as there would be more transactions.\n“Perhaps for the first time in history both the Treasury and the OBR have discovered their inner Laffer curve,” Hunt said, to polite chuckles.\nRachel Reeves the Tory\nArguably more forced was Hunt’s brief diversion when announcing the permanent extension of a tax break for the theatre and performance arts sector, with a dig at his Labour opposite number over taxes.\nThis section would be, Hunt said, of “particular interests to the shadow chancellor, who seems to fancy her thespian skills when it comes to acting like a Tory. The trouble is, we all know how her show ends: higher taxes.”\nReeves, on the benches opposite, grimaced. Others sympathised.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe effing education secretary\nAs every veteran of the working men’s club comedy circuit knows, when you face a tough crowd, you can do worse than lower the tone a bit.\nAnd so it was that in talking about schools, Hunt said he thought the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, “is doing an effing good job”.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a reference, obvious to all in the chamber, to Keegan’s unguarded comments to a TV crew in September amid the crisis over crumbling concrete in schools, lamenting that nobody had praised her for doing a “fucking good job”, while “everyone else has sat on their arse and done nothing”.\n \n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Former miners are “dying in abject poverty” and “can’t afford to bury themselves” while the government takes billions of pounds out of their pension funds, campaigners have said, on the 40th anniversary of the miners’ strikes. The National Mineworkers Pension Campaign said the former prime minister Boris Johnson “lied through his back teeth” when he promised in 2019 to end an arrangement that has seen the government take 50% of the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme surplus funds in exchange for a commitment that the pot’s value would not drop. In 2021, a Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee report recommended ending the deal, which was set up in 1994 without, campaigners say, sufficient input from the National Union of Mineworkers. The report said: “Allowing the arrangement to continue would appear antithetical to the government’s stated aim of redressing socioeconomic inequality and ‘levelling up’ left-behind communities.” The report acknowledged that the deal had been far more beneficial to the government than expected and recommended ending it. However, no action has been taken since the report, despite promises from the government, with campaigners claiming their pensions are being raided, leaving many ex-miners destitute. Charles Chiverton, a spokesperson for the campaign, said at least £4.2bn had been taken out of the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme, which could have been used to improve the lives of ex-miners and their families. Some members of the campaign estimate as much as £10bn has been lost through the deal. A fifth of members get as little as £10 a week from the pension scheme, with the majority of them getting £50 a week or less. Speaking about the effect on those who worked as miners for decades, including during the bleak period which began exactly 40 years ago when mineworkers took strike action in an effort to save their jobs, Chiverton said: “It’s just disgraceful that we’ve got members that have died in abject poverty. “They’ve not only had the coalmines shut down and the community devastated, which leaves so many black holes, they can’t even enjoy a trip out to the seaside like they would have done.” “The worst is that some can’t afford to bury themselves,” he said. The scheme had more than 300,000 members when it was set up and now has 115,000, as each year about 7,000 former miners and their spouses die.   Related: ‘The officer could have smashed her skull’: the 1984 miners’ strike in pictures   Numerous MPs from both parties have backed their cause, including the Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, who said he had raised the issue of “a fairer deal” with his own government. The campaigners said the scheme was administered by trustees who held a fiduciary duty to members but were not obliged to open up meetings, which were held in private, or publish the minutes of meetings for the members to scrutinise. They added that their request for an annual general meeting was denied. “The government control our scheme. We control nothing. So we’re, in effect, voiceless.” Chiverton said he believed, four decades on, that a Conservative government was making an example of miners, echoing the era of Margaret Thatcher. He said: “Not only have they taken our jobs and communities away from us, they’ve taken our retirement, our dignity. They’ve taken everything. And what for? To punish us for having the audacity to stand up and fight for our coalmines and our communities? Was that such a bad thing to do?” The strike, in which miners were killed, injured and imprisoned has left a traumatic legacy. Chiverton, who worked as a miner for 28 years and was only 20 years old when the strikes started on 6 March 1984, said: “There are programmes about the strike on the BBC and Channel 4 – I can’t watch it because it’s still too raw.” He still sees the impact of the pit closures on former mining communities, having worked for 15 years in the probation service and witnessed the arrival of destitution, drugs and crime into former industrial towns and cities. He added: “You wouldn’t believe what we’ve turned into, these once proud mining communities. “It breaks me. It does, honestly. It breaks me.” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “We remain committed to protecting mineworkers’ pensions, while striking a fair balance between scheme members and taxpayers. “Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme members are receiving payments 33% higher than they would have been thanks to our guarantee. “On most occasions, the scheme has been in surplus, and scheme members have received bonuses in addition to their guaranteed pension.”"

        "content": "Retaining the fuel duty cut in the budget is a regressive policy that benefits the wealthiest in society, who will save £60 a year, while those who earn the least will save just £22, according to analysis. Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday announced an extension of the 5p cut in fuel duty brought in during 2022, for which he has won plaudits across the rightwing press. But the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank found the freeze, expected to cost £5bn a year, is bad value for money and benefits the wealthiest in society who tend to own more cars, and drive less fuel-efficient vehicles such as SUVs. Combined, the fuel duty freeze, which has been in place since it was introduced as a temporary measure in 2011, and the 5p cut to fuel duty, have cost the Treasury £100bn since 2011, according to the SMF analysis. The two tax cuts to fuel are expected to knock £27bn off Treasury coffers over five years. The Conservatives attacked Labour’s ditched £28bn green investment promise over the same period as ruinously expensive.   Related: The Guardian view on budget tax cuts: stealing from the public | Editorial   Critics have said the fuel duty cut “helps the rich” while doing “little for the economy” as public transport worsens in quality. In total, the SMF found the bottom fifth of earners would receive just 10% of the savings, compared with the top fifth who would pocket 24%. Chris Todd, the director of the campaign group Transport Action Network, said: “We need to increase investment in public transport to help level up and give people better access to jobs, healthcare and recreation. Instead, we’re seeing services slashed to subsidise cuts in fuel duty. These cuts mostly help the rich and do little for the economy. Those in need suffer most from poorer services and the higher levels of pollution that will follow.” Sarah McMonagle, the director of external affairs at Cycling UK, said: “Far too many of us are dependent on our car but that’s because the government has failed to invest long term in public transport, cycling and walking, to give more people affordable, safe and reliable alternatives to driving. The public needs integrated transport policies and long-term investment, not political rhetoric about standing up for drivers.” The SMF has suggested more equitable and green ways to cut motoring costs, which would be investing in public transport, that “provide cheaper alternatives to driving for those who want to switch and decreases congestion for those who don’t”. The analysis found that for every 10% increase in public transport speed relative to driving, the average household saved £435 a year on transport costs. Electric vehicle drivers spend almost half as much fuelling their car as the equivalent petrol or diesel model, and the SMF has calculated that if the initial price of an electric vehicle was the same, households would save an average of £900 annually. The thinktank suggests the government should instead spend the money used to cut fuel duty to build charge points and help lower-income households afford electric vehicles. Gideon Salutin, a senior researcher at the SMF, said: “Listening to the rhetoric around fuel duty, you would think freezes provide immediate relief for low-income households and working-class commuters. But those are the households that tend to drive less, own fewer cars and travel more efficiently. “By constraining fuel duty, the government is wasting billions of pounds every year while robbing low-income households of cheaper options like public transport and EVs. These could pull millions out of poverty, but instead we’re wasting billions on unjust cuts.”"

        "content": "Peter Mandelson has received a lighthearted rebuke that “people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones” after he was accused of “fat shaming” Keir Starmer. The Labour peer was discussing the importance of presentation in politics when he compared the Labour leader’s appearance to the likes of Rishi Sunak. He said clothes and appearance were “not unimportant” in politics, noting on the Times Radio podcast How to Win an Election that “Starmer needs to shed a few pounds and that would be an improvement”. Mandelson recalled encouraging the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock to move away from “regimental style” dark-coloured ties, to ones with more small white polka dots”. He accused Tony Blair of not “compensating” him after he bought him a large amount of “expensive, colourful” ties “that showed boldness and confidence”. Even Gordon Brown was criticised for “being into brain power” instead of “tie power” as he often opted for bold red-coloured ties. Sunak has been widely criticised for his skinny suits, with Mandelson noting it “diminishes him rather than expands him”. In an effort to be even-handed, he went for Starmer’s body weight. In response, Wes Streeting told LBC: “As the shadow health secretary I’m against that kind of fat shaming, Peter Mandelson should know better. Let me tell you we have seen the odd paunch from [Peter] over the years so in glass houses people shouldn’t throw stones.” Starmer was a vegetarian for almost 30 years but now eats fish. He told the Table Manners podcast last year his children were raised as vegetarians but allowed to choose their own diet after they turned 10. In a biography by Tom Baldwin, the Labour leader confessed to indulging in a takeaway box of chicken when on the last train home to London from Sheffield during his tenure as shadow Brexit secretary. He said he was handed a takeaway box, adding: “I opened it sitting on a freezing-cold station platform and found it was chicken. I wasn’t going to get anything else at that time of night, so I ate every morsel – and very good it tasted too.”"

        "content": "Prime ministers should send their cabinet members to a school of government and stop the constant rotation of ministers to improve strategic thinking in Whitehall, a former cabinet secretary has said. Mark Sedwill, who ran the civil service for Boris Johnson and Theresa May, said effective government needed “longevity of personnel”, rather than a stream of new ministers without expertise in their portfolios. Speaking to a parliamentary committee on strategic thinking in government, Sedwill criticised the “tendency to reset the clocks and have a year zero” every time new ministers are appointed. Referring to the habit of politicians of making media announcements in order to dominate the headlines and appear active in government, Sedwill highlighted the “huge pressure because of the ‘grid phenomenon’”, adding: “Those [announcements] inevitably aren’t strategic, tend to be quite short term and aren’t always aligned with the other existing policy.” Over the last few years there has been unusually high turnover at the top of departments. Johnson appointed a slew of new ministers after mass resignations and Liz Truss had a short-lived cadre of ministers during her seven weeks in Downing Street. Sedwill said any new prime minister would be “well advised to put ministers in place and train them properly and leave them there as long as they can”. He said the UK appeared to “rotate ministers faster than elsewhere” and had a cabinet twice as big as that of the US president, with many top ministers not having any expertise in their area when they start the job. The former senior official supported the idea of a school of government with its own campus, where “rising stars” among ministers, MPs and officials could network and mingle. Asked how to develop the strategic thinking skills of ministers, he said: “Teach it to them. We don’t really teach ministers about government – they’re expected to sink or swim. “Political skills are critically important for a minister but they aren’t the only skills a really effective minister needs. They also need governance skills. But those things don’t arise naturally. You have to teach them. “We don’t really train ministers at all, but to be frank, if you really want them to be strategic, you need to give them time to be strategic.” In 2021, Johnson announced he would “invest in training for civil servants and for ministers, with high standards for online provision as well as the creation of a new physical campus”. There is currently a “government campus” programme of training for civil servants that has run online and in-person courses for officials since 2020, with a Leadership College for Government. However, there is not yet a direct replacement for the National School of Government that was closed down under the coalition in 2012 and provided a permanent headquarters for government training. Sedwill was giving evidence on Tuesday as part of the inquiry into strategic thinking in government that was ordered after the pandemic by the liaison committee, which is made up of select committee chairs and holds the prime minister to account. In written evidence to the committee, the former head of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, called for an end to the government handling crises over WhatsApp, saying the platform might suit gossip and informal exchanges but was inappropriate for important decision-making. Omand, who ran the UK intelligence service before becoming the permanent secretary of the Home Office and the Cabinet Office, criticised the way government was conducted in the pandemic and said future crises should be handled with “proper process”. He said in his evidence that ministers and officials often engaged in “gossip” and “informal exchanges” as they gathered for cabinet meetings, which helped let off steam when pressure had built up. “It is understandable that WhatsApp messages might fulfil a comparable function during lockdowns that limited much face-to-face contact,” he said. “But to judge by the evidence now made public by the Covid-19 inquiry, such exchanges (leaving aside the vile misogyny) had become the foreground means of forcing outcomes, not just sharing background mood music. “That Covid rationale no longer applies, if it ever did. It is essential to have a proper decision-making process if we are to survive a crisis in good order.” He added: “There is little point in devoting effort to identifying strategic opportunities and strategic threats and risks if, when the time for action comes, there is no proper process for weighing decisions against strategic goals and adjusting course accordingly.”"

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt’s constituency office in Surrey has been vandalised with graffiti saying “die Tory scum” on the eve of his spring budget statement. Police are investigating after the front door and two windows of the chancellor’s local office in Hindhead were defaced. The graffiti was discovered on Tuesday morning. Hunt’s constituency office was likely to have been vandalised between 8pm and 9pm on Monday, according to Surrey police. The chancellor and MP for South West Surrey said he would not be “deterred” by the attack on his office.  A spokesperson for Surrey police said: “Officers were called following reports of criminal damage at a property on Tilford Road in Hindhead, which is believed to have taken place between 8pm and 9pm on Monday 4 March. “The criminal damage involved graffiti being sprayed on the windows on the outside of the property. No one was present in the property at the time of the criminal damage. “If anyone has any information that could help our investigation, including any CCTV, dashcam or helmet cam footage, please contact us via live chat on our website quoting PR/45240025530.” The incident comes amid increased concerns about MPs’ safety and security arrangements. It was reported last month that three female MPs were given bodyguards and cars after a risk assessment. The MPs, who have not been named, have been given close protection by private companies and chauffeur-driven vehicles. Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, is understood to have been working with the Home Office, police chiefs and parliamentary authorities to bolster the safety and security of MPs. Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP and shadow international development secretary, recently spoke of how she carried a police alarm with her everywhere and only saw her constituents by appointment. Lindsay Hoyle recently warned of the growing threat to politicians. The Commons speaker also spoke of his deep concern about the security of MPs being a factor in his decision to break with precedent and allow Labour to table a vote during an SNP debate calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. He told MPs: “I will defend every member in this house. Both sides, I never ever want to go through a situation where I pick up a phone to find a friend, whatever side, has been murdered by terrorists. I also don’t want an attack on this house.” Hoyle added: “The details of the things that have been brought to me are absolutely frightening. I am guilty because I have a duty of care that I will carry out to protect people. It is the protection that led me to make the wrong decision.”"

        "content": "Michelle Donelan, the science minister, has apologised and paid damages after accusing two academics of “sharing extremist views” and one of them of supporting Hamas. In a statement posted on X, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology said she had deleted a tweet and letter published last year, and accepted what she termed a “clarification” from one of the academics, Prof Kate Sang at Heriot-Watt university in Edinburgh. Sang launched a libel action against Donelan after the minister published a letter to the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) which urged it to cut links with Sang and another academic, Dr Kamna Patel of University College London. Donelan had described her “disgust and outrage” at their appointment to an expert advisory group to Research England on equality, diversity and inclusion.   Related: UK research funding body in row with ministers over free speech and Gaza   UKRI is the umbrella agency responsible for channelling £3bn in higher education research funding, including to Research England. The institute suspended Sang and Patel while it carried out an investigation into Donelan’s allegations, which appear to have been triggered by a report by Policy Exchange. In a statement, Sang said: “I am delighted that this matter has now concluded, but very disturbed by the way in which Michelle Donelan and UKRI behaved. Had they asked me at the start, I would have explained the true position. “Instead, Michelle Donelan made a cheap political point at my expense and caused serious damage to my reputation. I propose to donate part of the damages she has paid to a charity.” Donelan’s complaint included Sang’s retweeting of a Guardian article from last October headlined “Suella Braverman urges police to crack down on Hamas support in UK”, to which Sang added the comment: “This is disturbing.” Donelan’s statement said: “I am grateful for Professor Sang’s clarification, and I am pleased to withdraw my original concerns in relation to this specific tweet.” She added: “As I said to the media at the time, and I want to reiterate now: I have never thought or claimed that Professor Sang, or any member of the board [of Research England’s expert advisory group], committed a criminal offence. I fully accept that she is not an extremist, a supporter of Hamas or any other proscribed organisation and I note that an independent investigation has concluded that there was no evidence that she is. I have deleted my original post to my X accounts.” Donelan’s department said that it had paid the damages and legal costs when asked who had done so, adding: “This was subject to all the usual cross-government processes and aims to reduce the overall costs to the taxpayer that could result from protracted legal action.” A No 10 source said Rishi Sunak had full confidence in Donelan, calling her “an excellent minister”. Peter Kyle, the shadow science secretary, said: “The secretary must prove she still has the confidence of the research community after using her department to make false allegations against academics.” He said accusing a researcher of sharing extremist material and sympathising with a proscribed group was a “new low in government standards”. Tamsin Allen, who represented Sang in her libel complaint, said: “Michelle Donelan has now withdrawn her false allegations and agreed to pay damages and costs to Professor Sang. It is extraordinary that a minister should be guided by a lobby group into making serious false allegations about private citizens without doing the first piece of due diligence.” On Tuesday UKRI’s board announced that its investigation “found no evidence in the public domain of support for a proscribed terrorist organisation or the sharing of extremist material and no grounds to remove any individual members of the Research England expert advisory group”. UKRI also said it had found no evidence of a breach in the expert advisory group’s terms of reference, and no failure to uphold the seven “Nolan” principles of public life. Patel said: “There was never any need for UKRI to investigate as it should have been obvious from the start that we had not breached the Nolan principles or expressed extremist views. Worryingly, it appears UKRI were steered by who made the claim and not its substance. It has been a distressing series of events and I am glad that it has concluded with no finding against us.” Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “This investigation completely exonerates our members and confirms Michelle Donelan’s unprecedented, politicised intervention was an outrageous attack on academic freedom.” Prof Ottoline Leyser, UKRI’s chief executive, said: “Our intention, as soon as these concerns were raised by the secretary of state, was to adopt a well-governed process to support evidenced, principled decisions. “I am grateful for the thorough work of all those involved in this investigation. I hope this will bring clear resolution in a way that best supports all of those who serve on our advisory groups, and research and innovation in the UK.”"

        "content": "This is the End. Beautiful Friend. This is the End. My only Friend, the End. Forget about Wednesday’s budget. That 2p reduction on national insurance that worked so well last year. That surprise decision to maintain the freeze on fuel duty for the 437th year in a row. Those cuts to public services that Jeremy Hunt is trying to pretend he hasn’t been briefing the newspapers about. None of this matters. Nothing is going to switch the dial. There is nothing more Rishi Sunak can do. If you don’t love him now, you never will. We are now in the Tunnel. That political parallel universe in which everything and nothing happens. You can take your pick. The news schedules are busier than ever but are forgotten within hours. Because nothing really matters. We are now on a rinse, spin and repeat cycle that will only end in a general election. Where the debate gets ever more extreme yet somehow less substantial. Most people have long since switched off. You can almost hear their screams of, ‘Make it stop’. Just count the days. Breathe deeply. Squeeze in an extra pilates session. Anything to distract yourself. Be of good comfort. The end is getting ever closer.  How can we be sure? Because Rish! has just done a video for Grazia. The inevitable kiss of death. You know there is no way out now. This is the fate of every party leader with an election imminent. But there is no comeback. Once sold, your soul can never be redeemed. This is the Sunaks relaxing at home together. Or rather Rish! and Akshata staring miserably into a camera while sitting on a sofa. A more excruciating five and a half minutes would be hard to find. You can see the look of death behind Rish!’s eyes. Even he – someone notoriously unself-aware – knows this is a video too far. But then he’s come too far to back down now. The wheels are spinning far too fast for him to get off now. All he can do is wait till they stop. Only then will he discover where he’s been spat out. So he smiles and smiles and smiles. And still he doesn’t come close to warmth or sincerity. It is the icy smile of a man praying that his wife doesn’t land him in it. Because Akshata, at least, still seems up for it. No one has told her there are no winners in this latest PR stunt. The best you can hope for is to come out unscathed. Either she is terminally bored with her life and finds mind-numbingly dumb questions a merciful release. Or she is a stunningly good actor. Put it like this: this is the level of interview you would even trust Chris Philp not to screw up. On second thoughts, perhaps not. Let’s start with the chores. Who makes the bed? Definitely not me, said Akshata. Full of energy, totes engaging with this. “I’m not a morning person. At college, Rish! – she’s even adopted my nickname for him – would come round and I’d still be in bed eating.” “Er, yes,” Sunak interrupted. This was too much information. Time to take control of the narrative. He really, really cared about bed-making. So much so that he would sometimes interrupt a meeting of the cabinet to go upstairs to the Downing Street flat to make sure it was done properly. SCOOP. How about loading the dishwasher? Rish! dived in. This was also very much his territory. He happened to also really, really care about this. If it wasn’t done properly, he would empty it and start again. KILL ME NOW. Literally, who cares? I mean, here we have a prime minister who has guided the economy into a recession. Who is prepared to break international law to fly a plane load of refugees to Rwanda. Who has done nothing to stop the NHS from falling apart. Who is now trying to fight a culture war that he has started. Who takes no responsibility for the extremism in his own party. And now we’re all supposed to think, “You know what, I can overlook all this because he loads the dishwasher. That’s my kind of guy. He gets my vote. What a human! What a hero!” Er … if it’s all the same, I’d be perfectly happy if Rish! never went anywhere near the kitchen provided he made a decent job of running the country. But that wasn’t the agenda. So on we went. How about the children? Akshata was quite strict with them about their schoolwork, but otherwise wasn’t that bothered. Rish! liked to give them snacks. Bless. But he also wished they would walk the dog from time to time. But then, why have staff? They can’t just sit around all day. Akshata admitted she had more leisure time than her husband. Who would have guessed? Though what she did with it, she wouldn’t say. Other than go to the odd spin class. Maybe she just puts her feet up on the sofa and manages her investments all day. So that when Rish! comes back from work saying the economy is in crisis again, she can tell him the good news that they have made another couple of million. And that was about it. Rish! didn’t have time to read. So bedtime was the same episode of Friends over and over again. Why bother, when you can just watch this video? This will knock you out quicker than your nightly dose of fentanyl. An exercise in sublime futility. Imagine being too boring for your new, blissed out neighbours in Malibu. Still, Rish! could at least console himself that he hadn’t committed the cardinal error of committing news. Unlike David Cameron, who in his BBC hagiography before the 2015 election, in between saying “Hail, good fellow, well met” to various tradesmen in Chipping Norton, let slip that he was too chillaxed for words and couldn’t face the prospect of running for a third term. Much too much like hard work. Well, that ended well, didn’t it? But life can be cripplingly unfair at times. You’d have thought that Dave would have run his course after Brexit. That he had done enough damage. Time to say bye byes. But for Dave there would be second, third or even fourth chances. For men like Dave there always are. Lord Big Dave is now foreign secretary. Generally thought to be doing a great job. We are supposed to be grateful that he is doing us the favour. The truth is he’s much the same as he always was. It’s just that the competition has become so much weaker. He only looks like a statesman because he’s up against the Tory class of 24. What goes around, comes around, I guess. There’s hope for Rishi yet."

        "content": "Mary Riley, who has died aged 101, was a pioneer in the field of town and country planning, and the first woman to be appointed a county officer in England and Wales, in 1973. She was also the first female chair of the Town and Country Planning Association (1983-86). It was on her watch that the TCPA launched the national Planning Aid service to give voice to communities affected by top-down decisions. Born in Liverpool, Mary was the daughter of Edith and Tom Burns, a purser in the merchant marine. It was a musical household, and at the age of six she was taken to a concert at St George’s Hall, afterwards shaking hands with Sergei Rachmaninov. She excelled at Holly Lodge girls’ school, then studied geography at the London School of Economics, which had been relocated to Cambridge due to the blitz. Living in Liverpool through the depression, then witnessing the wartime bombing on the city’s port, sparked Mary’s interest in seeking ways to reduce social and economic inequalities and rebuild for a fairer society. Graduating in 1943, Mary did wartime service at St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh. Once the second world war had finished, she took the civil service exams – coming, she claimed, third from top in the country – and joined the regional office in Birmingham working on social and economic planning for the West Midlands. Mary spotted exciting prospects in the newly created local planning authorities, and in 1949 successfully applied to be assistant county planning officer for Staffordshire council, leading their research team. By 1973 she was county planning officer for Staffordshire. Following reorganisation in 1974, all English planning departments had to prepare a longterm strategy. As chief officer, Mary led the team that enabled Staffordshire to be the first English county to do so, in the same year. As chair and later vice-president of the TCPA, Mary supported the work of Tony Gibson in his development of Planning for Real, a radical initiative in which local communities participate in working towards the future in their local area, and was a founder trustee of the Neighbourhood Initiatives Foundation set up in 1988. I came to know Mary during my time as director of the TCPA (1998-2001). She was a committed Anglican and a true Christian socialist. Her first marriage, to Dennis Riley, ended with his death. Her second husband, Desmond Matthews, survives her. "

        "content": "My friend and fellow councillor Peter Christie, who has died aged 73, was Britain’s first Green party mayor and the youngest mayor of Bideford in Devon. He joined the Greens (then known as the Ecology party) in 1981 after hearing a talk by Edward Goldsmith, founding editor and publisher of the Ecologist magazine. Within a couple of years he had been elected to Bideford town council, becoming mayor in 1985. He fulfilled that role on a further three occasions, topping the polls in the next 11 elections in which he stood.In 1991 Peter was elected to Torridge district council, becoming chairman in 2014. As a councillor he co-founded a local nature reserve, set up a scheme to help establish local businesses and highlighted many environmental issues. Born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, to Roy, a youth employment officer, and Sheila, a college secretary, Peter lived for a time in one of the prefabs hastily erected in that heavily bombed city after the second world war. His parents later moved to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, where he attended King Edward VI grammar school. After leaving school he had a gap year in the merchant navy (1969-70), sailing around the world with the Shaw-Savill line as an ordinary seaman. He then did some archaeological digging as a volunteer before completing a geography degree at Portsmouth Polytechnic (now University of Portsmouth), later undertaking an MA there. In 1976 he obtained a lecturing post in geography at North Devon College in Barnstaple, staying there until 2012, when he retired. On Saturdays, for the best part of 30 years, Peter also ran a secondhand book and record stall on Bideford market. Later it became a small shop staffed by a full-time employee.  As a historian he wrote, co-wrote or edited 41 books on North Devon history, plus more than 1,000 articles in the North Devon Journal and the North Devon Gazette, drawing on his extensive collection of local photographs and documents. In addition, from 2006 onwards Peter penned a weekly column, Bideford Life, for the North Devon Journal, and provided the newspaper with a regular page of old photographs and local history titbits. From 1991 until 2004 he was reviews editor for the Local Historian, magazine of the British Association for Local History.  A popular speaker on aspects of North Devon history, he was a trustee of Bideford Bridge Trust and North Devon Maritime Museum, and chairman of the North Devon Athenaeum.He is survived by his partner, Annette Waehler, his daughters, Jessica and Maeve, from his 1978 marriage to Judith Brown, which ended in divorce in 2001, and six grandchildren."

(See 3.51pm.)\n\n\nMark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has hit back at Rishi Sunak’s criticism of the policing of anti-war protests, dismissing claims officers are failing to enforce the law and saying officers were being labelled “woke and fascist” at the same time.\n\n\nJonathan Ashworth, a senior Labour frontbencher, has placed a bet on live television that Rishi Sunak will call a general election in May.\n\n\nDowning Street is facing a backlash from Conservative MPs and peers over moves to create a broader of definition of extremism in response to what Rishi Sunak describes as the threat of “mob rule”.\n\n\nMartin Lewis, the consumer champion, has told MPs that introducing financial education into the national curriculum in England may have been “counterproductive”. Lewis campaigned for this move, which was introduced in 2014. But, in evidence to the Commons education committee this morning, he said schools did not have the resources to deliver it properly. He said:\n\n\nI still think there is a real poverty of financial education in the UK … I think in many ways, getting it on the curriculum was a pyrrhic victory. In some ways, it was counterproductive.\n\n\n\n\n 5.16pm GMT \n\nKeeping primates as pets in England will be banned from 6 April, the government has announced. People will only be allowed to keep primates if they provide them with zoo-level welfare standards.\n\n\n\n 5.12pm GMT \nGreen party criticises Labour for not being willing to block Rwanda bill in Lords\n\nThe Green party has criticised Labour for not being willing to block the Rwanda bill. This is from the Green peer Jenny Jones ahead of the debate tomorrow, when peers will vote on further amendements to the bill.\n\nThis is a mess of a bill. It is illegal and nonsensical. We are being asked to indulge in another day of pointless chatter, with great legal minds drawing up detailed amendments that the government will ignore. And this is partly fuelled by the Labour party refusing to vote this bill down.\nThe Labour party are trying to rewrite the Salisbury Convention that says that the Lords should not stop anything in the government’s manifesto. Labour wants that to apply to all legislation passed by MPs, as the Commons is elected and the second chamber is not. Then what is the point of the Lords? Why don’t they join the Green party in calling for the Lords to be abolished and replaced by an elected second chamber?”\nLabour seem to hope that when they are in government, then the Conservatives will reciprocate, but that clearly isn’t going to happen.\n\nLabour has said that it is not constitutionally appropriate for the Lords to vote down a bill passed by the elected chamber.\nIn a thread on X last night Sunder Katwala, who runs the British Future thinktank, says there has been relatively little discussion of Labour’s decision not to hold up the bill. He does not go as far as Jones, in saying Labour should vote down the bill, but he suggests Labour might have been better advised to deploy aggressive delaying tactics in the Lords.\nHere are some of his posts.\n\n\nIt is widely understood/assumed across Lords groups- but almost entirely undebated in media & politics - that Labour Party has made a tactical decision to let the government push the bill through. Rather than to use a delay threat to insist on one of these amendments (or others)— Sunder Katwala (@sundersays) March 4, 2024\n\n\n\nIt is widely understood/assumed across Lords groups- but almost entirely undebated in media & politics - that Labour Party has made a tactical decision to let the government push the bill through. Rather than to use a delay threat to insist on one of these amendments (or others)\n\n\nLabour’s calculation: the risks of a “get Rwanda done” message about delaying the scheme (nb/scars of 2019) mean they need to give the government the bill *including* reviving govt chance of sending some planes to Rwanda (including removals that UK courts/ECHR would find unsafe)\n\n\nA much more *consequential* ethical decision (for MPs/peers) than votes on Gaza, which are emotionally, symbolically & politically significant. But whose real world impacts are minor. Here, the real life impact is much more significant (if planes go that might not, esp unsafely)\n\n\nEthics aside, the (unexplored & undebated) politics look questionable. Are the scars of 2019 seeing Labour generals fight last electoral war & give Sunak an unexpected gift? Is giving Sunak proof of concept on Rwanda really smart to stop him blaming Labour for failing to deliver?\n\n\n\n\n 4.38pm GMT \nBraverman calls for emergency legislation to restrict pro-Palestinan demonstrations\n\nSuella Braverman, the former home secretary, has told GB News that Rishi Sunak did not go far enough in his speech on extremism on Friday. She claimed that parts of London were becoming “no-go areas for Jewish people” as a result of the pro-Palestinian marches and she said Sunak should have announced emergency legislation to restrict them. She explained:\n\nWe need to be holding the police to account in a better way and I would have liked to have seen an emergency law introduced to actually empower ministers and empower all of those policymakers who are responsible for this issue to actually take steps to restrict some of these marches. \nThis has been going on now for four months. It’s become a weekly fixture. Parts of London have become a no-go areas for Jewish people. That is totally unacceptable. We’ve seen antisemitism skyrocket.\n\nIn its recent report on the protests, the Commons home affairs committee quotes evidence from the Metropolitan police saying that, although people have been committing hate crimes in “very small numbers” during the protests, the “overwhelming majority” of people attending have behaved lawfully and peacefully.\n\n\n'The time for words has come to an end, we need to see action.'Suella Braverman calls on Rishi Sunak to introduce emergency legislation to ban certain Palestine marches.📺 Freeview 236, Sky 512, Virgin 604🔓 Become a GB News Member: https://t.co/mNsRsGC8ef pic.twitter.com/Xt9DUrLOp6— GB News (@GBNEWS) March 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.51pm GMT \nEx-Post Office chair gives new details of 'stitch up' which he says led to Badenoch making false claims about his sacking\n\nThe former Post Office chair Henry Staunton has revived his claim that Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, and others have spread false claims about him to justify her decision to sack him in January.\nIn a letter to the Commons business committee, he gave his fullest account yet of the misconduct allegation about him that was used by Badenoch to part-justify her decision to dismiss him.\nIn a statement to MPs last month explaining why she got rid of Staunton, Badenoch said that when Staunton was chair “a formal investigation was launched into allegations made regarding his conduct, including serious matters such as bullying” and that “concerns were brought to my Department’s attention about Mr Staunton’s willingness to co-operate with that investigation”.\nLast week Staunton told the committee that it was actually Nick Read, the chief executive, who was being investigated over a misconduct allegation. He said the Post Office’s HR director had submitted an 80-page “Speak Up” whistleblowing complaint about Read, and that just one paragraph referred to him. It wrongly said he had made a politically incorrect comment, he claimed.\nIn his follow-up letter, now published, Staunton explained what had actually been said. He recalled:\n\nThe context of my conversation [with the HR director] was that whilst reviewing a list of shortlisted candidates for a NED [non executive director] position, I recounted, by way of example of the obstacles that I had encountered previously in my attempts to promote board diversity, a conversation I had had when I was chair of another organisation in which, a woman in a senior management role had said to me that she did not like appointing “girls” because they were, in her experience, “pains in the arses”. It was clear to the HR director at the time that I was not personally using offensive terms, if anything the opposite, and she confirmed that to me subsequently. Indeed, given the context it could not have been understood in any other way.\n\nStaunton said the HR director used some of this language in her whistleblowing complaint, to explain how she felt she was being treated at the Post Office. She was not complaining about Staunton, he said.\nHe said that in a subsequent interview with Post Office investigators the HR director said the “girls” and “pains in the arses” remarks came from Staunton. He said they then used this to discredit him. \n\n[The investigators] were clearly not interested in understanding the context of the remarks, which were quoting critically what was said by a third party on another occasion at another organisation. All they were interested in was the fact that they had stumbled on a pretext for widening the investigation to include me, which is why I can only consider this sham investigation as a stitch up …\nDespite the unbelievably weak grounds for launching an investigation into me personally which was prompted by a primary complaint by the HR director against the chief executive, and the chief executive alone, I have fully cooperated with the investigation, have answered all their questions to the best of my ability, and indeed have recently attended an interview with the barrister leading the investigation. I take assertions to the contrary by both the Post Office and the Business Department very seriously indeed. To me they are further evidence of the way closing ranks and covering people’s backs have, through this entire sorry episode, been given priority over getting at the truth. I do not recognise the false equivalence between the allegations against Nick Read, some of which are serious, and the allegations against me which are flimsy in the extreme.\n\nIn a separate letter to the committee, the Post Office said that the HR director’s “Speak Up” note runs to 12 pages, not 80 pages. It is being disclosed to the committee on the assumption that confidential material will not be published. The Post Office said Staunton may have been thinking of a separate, 80-page report into someone else.\n\n\n\n 3.08pm GMT \n\nThe Lords will shortly start a debate on foreign affairs. But David Cameron, the foreign secretary, will be closing the debate, in the early evening, and not opening it as an earlier post said, the speaking list reveals. Lord Ahmad, a Foreign Office minister, is the first speaker.\n\n\n\n 2.59pm GMT \nRewatching Friends, and who's best at stacking dishwasher - Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty discuss life at home\n\nRishi Sunak has discussed his irritation at an unmade bed as well as his bedtime habit of watching Friends reruns, in an interview with Grazia, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nJoined by his wife, businesswoman Akshata Murty, the prime minister answered a number of questions about household jobs ahead of International Women’s Day (March 8), including who cooks more and who is more likely to make the bed.\n“We found out how the country’s most high-profile couple share domestic duties,” Grazia UK’s Instagram caption read.\nSunak cut a quieter figure than his wife, who took the lead on answering questions, with the Conservative party leader jumping in to criticise Murty’s dishwasher stacking and his children’s lack of dog-walking.\nOn unmade beds, Sunak said: “It bugs me, so I actually sometimes come up back into the flat from the office after we’ve all left and make the bed, because I’ll be irritated if it’s not made.”\nAsked about his favourite job around the house, he replied: “Hard choice … dishwasher stacking, making [the] bed? Both have a nice, satisfying ending. Probably the bed.”\nSunak labelled his wife’s penchant for having plates in her bed when she was younger as “disgusting” and said “That’s me” when asked who is better at loading the dishwasher.\n“It requires redoing after you’ve been very enthusiastic,” he told his wife.\n“It creates more work. And then more goes in as a result!”\nHe also said he wishes his children were better at walking their dog, but admitted his wife reads more than he does.\n“I’m too exhausted when I get home at the end of every day, so I watch an episode of Friends and then go to bed. It never gets old,” he said.\n“We have watched the same episodes of Friends I don’t know how many times,” said Murty.\nMurty also conceded that her husband is “the better cook”, although Sunak added: “It’s mainly just breakfast on a Saturday morning – Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs.”\n\nUPDATE: You can watch the clip here.\n\nUpdated at 4.16pm GMT\n\n\n 2.49pm GMT \nPost Office chief executive Nick Read defends telling MPs he never tried to resign\n\nThe Commons business committee has published a series of letters from Post Office figures relating to its marathon hearing last week where Henry Staunton, the former chair, said he was the victim of a smear campaign led by Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary.\nAt the weekend the Sunday Times reported that Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, repeatedly threatened to resign unless he got a pay rise. There were suggestions that this implied he was not telling the truth when, in his evidence to the committee, he dismissed talk of his resigning.\n\n\nThe Sunday Times: Post Office boss said he would quit unless he got £1 million #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/OfrhIsSiw7— George Mann (@sgfmann) March 2, 2024\n\n\nIn a letter now published, Read told the committee he wanted to “clarify” when he meant when he answered no in response to a question about whether he had ever tried to resign as chief executive. He said:\n\nTo reiterate the response I gave on the 27th, I have never tried to resign. Nor have I ever issued a resignation letter or resigned verbally. Like many people in highly complex roles like this one, I have suffered frustrations – many CEOs have conversations privately with appropriate people in their organisation and I am no different. However, I remain here completely committed to doing the vitally important work to support Postmasters and transform the Post Office.\n\n\n\n\n 2.10pm GMT \nLabour to end UK exemptions for bee-killing pesticides outlawed by EU\n\nLabour will end exemptions for bee-killing pesticides that have already been outlawed in the EU but which the UK government has approved for four years in a row, Daniel Zeichner, the shadow farming minister has said.

The spokesperson implied that Sunak was not a warm supporter of this initiative.\n\n Related: C of E hoping to create £1bn fund to address legacy of slavery \n\nAsked if the church was right to propose a £1bn fund of this kind, the spokesperson replied:\n\nIt’s obviously a matter for the Church of England. For the government’s part, there is clearly no plan to pay reparations. It’s widely recognised the UK led the international efforts and was one of the first countries in the world to abolish slavery and we believe the most effective way for UK to respond to our history is to look to the future …\nThe UK is making a real difference in the lives of people today through things like our overseas aid programmes, including in the Caribbean and Africa where we are investing in infrastructure, security and prosperity. \n\nThe spokesperson also pointed out that, in his speech on extremism on Friday, Sunak talked about his pride in Britain’s history. The spokesperson quoted the passage from the speech where Sunak said:\n\nNo country is perfect, but I am enormously proud of the good that our country has done. \nOur place in history is defined by the sacrifices our people have made in the service of our own freedom and that of others. \nAnd when these groups tell children that they cannot - and will not - succeed because of who they are, when they tell children that the system is rigged against them or that Britain is a racist country, this is not only a lie, but a cynical attempt to crush young dreams, and turn impressionistic minds against their own society. \n\n\n\n\n 1.12pm GMT \nLabour criticises Sunak over 40,000 people arriving in small boats since he became PM\n\nMore than 400 people arrived in the UK in small boats yesterday – the highest number crossing the Channel in a day so far this year, PA Media reports. The figures came out as the Home Office announced that the UK and France will lead a “customs partnership” involving other European countries intended to disrupt the supply of materials used to assemble small boats.\nPA says:\n\nHome Office figures show 401 people made the journey in seven boats. This suggests an average of around 41 people per boat.\nIt comes after 327 migrants crossed the Channel on Sunday in eight boats, meaning 728 people were recorded arriving within 48 hours.\nThe latest crossings take the provisional total number of UK arrivals so far this year to 2,983.\nThe second highest daily total recorded to date in 2024 was 358 migrants arriving on January 17 in eight boats.\nThe figures suggest more than 40,000 migrants have arrived in the UK since Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022, with over 72,000 arrivals recorded since the Rwanda deal was signed six months earlier.\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing, asked about the lastest figures, the PM’s spokesperson nsisted the UK’s joint work with France was “already delivering”, with more than 26,000 crossing attempts prevented in 2023 at an interception rate of 47%.\nAsked about the government defeats in the House of Lords last night on the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill, the spokesperson said:\n\nThere is still an option for the Lords to work for the House of Commons, protect innocent lives from perilous journeys across the Channel, and we hope that they will take that opportunity in future votes.\n\nThe spokesperson also refused to say whether or not the government has found an airline willing to fly migrants to Rwanda if the government orders flights to leave once the bill becomes law.\nCommenting on the latest arrival figures, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said:\n\nThis is the prime minister who promised the British people he would stop the boats, but has now seen more than 40,000 arrivals on his watch. This is the prime minister who said his strategy was working, yet is presiding over the busiest start to a year on record in terms of Channel crossings.\nUnder Rishi Sunak, independent reports show our border security has become a farce, billions are being spent on asylum hotels, and the Home Office has just lost thousands of asylum-seekers. Everything this prime minister touches fails, and our country deserves better than his weak, incompetent leadership.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.12pm GMT\n\n\n 12.53pm GMT \nMark Rowley hits back at criticism of Met's handling of marches, suggesting police can't be both 'woke and fascists'\n\nSir Mark Rowley has hit back at Rishi Sunak’s criticism of the policing of anti-war protests, dismissing claims officers are failing to enforce the law as “inaccurate” and claiming officers were being branded as “woke and fascist” at the same time.\nThe Metropolitan police commissioner spoke out on Tuesday after police leaders were last week summoned to a summit at Downing Street.\nIt was followed on Friday by the prime minister’s speech on extremism where he claimed forces – with the Met bearing the bulk of demonstrations – were managing rather than policing protests.\nAddressing the London policing board, Britain’s top officer said that claims “we are not where the law permits” were inaccurate, and that despite “warm words” offering support for police taking robust action, officers feel undermined with some facing death threats.\nRowley also said the majority of demonstrators were peaceful.\nOn Friday Sunak said:“This week I have met with senior police officers and made clear it is the public’s expectation that they will not merely manage these protests, but police them. And I say this to the police, we will back you when you take action.”\nIn his first comments since the PM’s speech, Rowley said: \n\nWe’re always operating in a very challenging political environments where tensions remain high and hate crime is still a long way above pre-October 7 levels.\nPolicing is used to being criticised. But where it isn’t justified, I do worry about the impact it has on our officers and staff, and on public confidence as we strive to operate without fear or favour.\nAt the moment, one side of the debate seems to say that we are guilty of two-tier policing and the other side says that we are oppressive and clamping down on the right to freedom of speech.\nIn this context of polarised public debate, I do think sometimes that we’re the first people who are able to be labelled simultaneously, woke and fascists …\nTo suggest that we are not where the law permits, as the law allows policing robustly, is inaccurate. At each of the major protests where the majority have been peaceful, we’ve seen wrongdoing and we’ve acted.\n\nHe said 360 arrests had been made in total including for public order and terrorism offences. Of those arrests, 90 were of far right supporters with police believing Suella Braverman’s comments immediately before a protest on Remembrance Sunday weekend, at least in part, incited trouble.\n\n\n\n 12.19pm GMT \nVoters overwhelmingly favour measures to reduce cost of living over more spending on public services, poll suggests\n\nWith Jeremy Hunt expected to cut personal taxes in the budget tomorrow, partly using revenue or headroom created by a further squeeze on public spending, many campaigners have pointed out that opinion polls suggest that this is not what voters want. There is a lot of polling suggesting people believe better funding for public services should be a higher priority than tax cuts. Only yesterday we published polling commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggesting almost three quarters of people are “very worried” or “fairly worried” about funding for the NHS and other public services, while fewer than half of them worry about tax levels.\nBut today YouGov has published new polling showing that, when the debate is framed using different language, voters overwhelmingly favour personal giveaways over more money for public services.\nIn his commentary, YouGov’s Matthew Smith reports:\n\nIn February, two separate YouGov polls showed that most Britons would prefer the government prioritise public spending over tax cuts …\nA variation of that same question which more explicitly notes that the cuts would be on taxes that “everyday people pay” closes the gap considerably, with 41% supporting tax cuts in this scenario, although this is still lower than the 47% who would prefer to put money towards public services.\nHowever, if rather than asking about tax cuts we instead ask about “measures to reduce the cost of living (e.g. measures that reduce food, energy and housing bills)”, then a remarkable shift occurs. Now, fully 64% would rather prioritise cost of living measures, compared to only 26% who would want to put the money towards public services.\n\nThis is a boost to Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, because it validates the decisions they are taking in the budget (as least in electoral terms – their priority), although, almost certainly, it won’t come as any surprise to them. The Conservative party knows a huge amount about public opinion because it commissions a lot of research like this for its own use.\nThe YouGov findings aren’t all positive for the government. They also show that 79% of people think public services are in a bad state.\n\n\n\n 11.44am GMT \nLabour challenges SNP over hint from senior figure party should consider not sending MPs to Westminster\n\nThe reverberations are continuing on Tuesday after the SNP’s deputy leader Keith Brown suggested at the weekend that his party’s MPs might withdraw from Westminster following the general election.\nBrown mused on the notion in a weekend newspaper column, resulting in private exasperation from many SNP MPs and public dismissal of the idea by other senior party figures - and it has since been seized on by opponents who like nothing better than evidence of Nationalist disarray.\nToday, Labour’s shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray has written to SNP leader Humza Yousaf demanding answers over the SNP’s official position on the matter. Yousaf has already dismissed the suggestion, insisting that “actually most of Keith’s piece was about the fact that we need SNP MPs down in Westminster standing up for Scotland.”\nBrown wrote that the issue of taking up seats needed to be “re-examined” in the wake of the row over the SNP’s Gaza motion, and “whether it is right to confer any legitimacy on an institution determined to deny democracy in Scotland”.\nHis comments don’t come out of nowhere – last week it was reported that some MPs were considering a campaign of “disengagement” with day-to-day parliamentary activities, amidst ongoing fury at the way the speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, dealt with the chaos and aftermath of the vote, but the party’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, later denied this.\nCertainly, this apparent mixed messaging is a gift to Scottish Labour – their current general election line is that the SNP say they want to “send a message” to Westminster, while Labour wants to “send a government”. Any suggestion that the SNP want to disengage more formally from the Commons only strengthens that message. \n\n\n\n 11.35am GMT \n\nSir Mark Rowley, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, has been giving evidence to the London Policing Board this morning. As Vikram Dodd reports, Rowley used the session to hit back at implicit criticism from Rishi Sunak about the way the police have been dealing with the pro-Palestian marches.\n\n\nSir Mark Rowley hits back at the PM's criticism of the policing of protests; says claims \"we are not where the law permits\" is inaccurate, despite \"warm words\" officers feel undermined and police are simultaneously being labelled as \"woke and fascist\".

They report:\n\nHunt is expected to extend for a further one year a “temporary” 5p-a-litre fuel duty cut and again scrap an inflation-linked rise in the levy, according to government insiders. No government has raised fuel duty since 2011.\nWhile [a further extension of the “temporary”fuel duty move would be welcomed by Conservative MPs, some believe Hunt will unveil a bigger prize in his March 6 Budget: a headline-grabbing 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax. \nSuch a move would cost about £14bn a year, but Hunt could just about fund it by shaving £5bn off future public spending, deploying £7bn of the sparse fiscal “headroom” allotted to him by official forecasters, and raising several billion pounds through targeted tax rises.\n\nBut Steven Swinford in the Times says national insurance will definitely be cut.\n\nJeremy Hunt will cut national insurance by 2 per cent in the Spring Budget tomorrow \nIt will cost £10bn and be worth £450 for the average worker. He will sell it as £900 worth of tax cuts when combined with 2 per cent NI cut in Autumn Statement \nAs per @SamCoatesSky legislation for NI cut will be brought forward next week, enabling it to come into effect in April \nCuts to income tax were deemed too expensive and potentially inflationary\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE:Jeremy Hunt will cut national insurance by 2 per cent in the Spring Budget tomorrowIt will cost £10bn and be worth £450 for the average worker. He will sell it as £900 worth of tax cuts when combined with 2 per cent NI cut in Autumn StatementAs per @SamCoatesSky…— Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) March 5, 2024\n\n\nCutting national insurance is cheaper than cutting income tax because pensioners do not pay it. Swinford says a 2p in the pound cut in employee national insurance would cost about £10b, while a 2p cut in income tax would cut £13.7bn.\nBut Sunak is said to have been pushing for a cut in the basic rate of income tax. That is partly because it is a visible tax cut than national insurance, partly because it benefits pensioners (who now constitute the core Tory vote) and partly because there is some evidence that people fear a national insurance cut means there is less money for benefits or pensions because they wrongly think NI funds benefits. (It doesn’t, or at least not directly; it’s just another tax, with the revenue going into the government’s general spending pot).\nSunak is also on record as promising to cut income tax. As Christopher Hope from GB News points out, as chancellor in March 2022 Sunak said in the spring statement that he would bring income tax down to 19p in the pound in 2024.\n\n\nRemember when Rishi Sunak - as Chancellor - said this time two years ago that he would cut income tax by 1p “before the end of this Parliament, in 2024”. Will the current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt deliver on Mr Sunak’s promise tomorrow? pic.twitter.com/9yY3Lo211o— Christopher Hope📝 (@christopherhope) March 5, 2024\n\n\nLater in 2022, during the summer Tory leadership campaign, Sunak proposed reducing the basic rate of income tax to 19% in 2024, as the first stage in a process taking it down to 16% in 2029.\n(Sunak initially avoided promising tax cuts in the campaign, because he was arguing for fiscal responsibility and attacking Liz Truss’s plans for unfunded tax cuts. He relented as he realised he was losing. Truss beat him anyway.)\nOne possibility is that Hunt will make an announcement covering both national insurance and income tax, with some cuts coming into force this years and others proposed as options for after the general election.\n\n\n\n 10.12am GMT \n\nIn a Spectator blog yesterday, Katy Balls said she did not think Rishi Sunak was likely to go for a May election. Referring to the dire Ipsos polling for the party, she said:\n\nWhile a May election has been discussed previously by No. 10 aides, it is unlikely. The argument for going early is that things will only go worse as the year goes on, so why not cut your losses and go now. However, polls such as this one make it rather hard to argue that going to the polls before the Tories need to is a good idea. What’s more, while there are plenty of problems coming up the track, the current picture is not good – the Tories will not want to call an election while the UK is in a technical recession.\n\n\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \n\nUnder election law a general election has to be held 25 working days after the dissolution of parliament. The House of Commons library has produced a useful briefing paper listing all the possible dissolution/election dates that Rishi Sunak could choose. For an election on Thursday 2 May, parliament would have to dissolve on Tuesday 26 March (three weeks today). But there is normally a day or two between the announcement of an election and dissolution, to allow time for non-controversial legislation to be passed in a rush (a process known as the wash up), and so Sunak would probably announce the election on Monday 25 March, or the previous week.\n\nUpdated at 12.28pm GMT\n\n\n 9.57am GMT \nSenior Tories criticise No 10 plans to broaden extremism definition\n\nDowning Street is facing a backlash from Conservative MPs and peers over moves to create a broader of definition of extremism in response to what Rishi Sunak describes as the threat of “mob rule”, Ben Quinn reports.\n\n Related: Senior Tories criticise No 10 plans to broaden extremism definition \n\nThe Times has splashed on a version of this story.\n\n\nTuesday's TIMES: Tories divided over new definition of extremism#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/VVFVtfqPAg— Jack Surfleet (@jacksurfleet) March 4, 2024\n\n\nIn his Times story Matt Dathan says Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, is due to announce the new, tougher definition of extremism within weeks. Dathan says:\n\nUnder proposals being considered, the definition would ban anyone in Whitehall, government bodies or quangos from engaging with or funding groups or individuals that meet the new definition. It is non-statutory, not a new criminal definition, so would only affect who government bodies, officials and ministers could engage with and fund …\nThe draft definition … would define extremism as the promotion or advancement of an ideology based on intolerance, hatred or violence that aims to undermine the rights or freedoms of others.\nSecondly, it would include those who seek to undermine or overturn the UK’s liberal system of democracy and democratic rights.\nAny groups or individuals who intentionally create a permissive environment for either of these would also be banned from working with government bodies. It is understood that this would include influencers on social media who are not extremists themselves but deliberately play down the danger of extremism.\n\n\n\n\n 9.49am GMT \n\nPhilip Cowley, a politics professor, put these posts on X yesterday explaining why he thought Rishi Sunak might go for a May election.\n\n\nI have long thought the election will be late 24 or even early 25. But I can see two things might work towards it being earlier.— Philip Cowley (@philipjcowley) March 4, 2024\n\n\n\nI have long thought the election will be late 24 or even early 25. But I can see two things might work towards it being earlier.\n\n\nThe first is that there is good data showing that, in many ways, things gets worse for the Tories with every month. Demographic changes and mortgage renewals alone are not helpful.\n\n\nThe second is the PM. While he doesn’t exactly strike me as a risk taker, he is numerate (something that cannot be said of all MPs) and takes data seriously. Plus, it is not as if he needs this job, in the way that some do.\n\n\nHe is a portfolio career guy. He isn’t going to spend the rest of his life on the backbenches or in the Lords. We can run a sweep on how long he will continue to serve the good folk of Richmond after his tenure in No10 ends, but we’d all bet low.\n\n\nSo in normal circs, you’d take the Micawber approach and cling on, hoping for something to turn up,it strikes me as quite possible that he becomes convinced that things will only get worse and he may as well go down fighting now and then he can do something that pays better...\n\n\nI still think late is more likely, because it would be a hell of a thing to be 20+ points behind and call an election. But, if someone really has convinced you that they will only get worse...?\n\n\n\n\n 9.40am GMT \nJonathan Ashworth bets Rishi Sunak will call general election in May\n\nGood morning. Westminster chatter about the prospect of Rishi Sunak calling the general election in May (specifically on Thursday 2 May, the most obvious date for a spring election) has been getting louder and louder in recent days, and this morning Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, ratcheted that up a notch by betting Kay Burley on Sky News that it would happen then.\nAshworth said:\n\nAnd by the way, this election, I think, is coming in May. I think it’s definitely coming in May. The Conservatives are planning for May.\n\nBurley offered to bet him that it wouldn’t. Being probably less wealthy than Piers Morgan, and certainly less vain and crass, Burley proposed a £10 bet, not a £1,000 one. Ashworth accepted, and they shook hands on it, with Ashworth suggesting that the money goes to a charity for the children of alcoholics.\nLabour has been prediciting for ages that the election will be in May, but most journalists at Westminster have, until recently, not taken this particularly seriously. Labour has its own reasons for claiming May is the date in Sunak’s diary. If Sunak delays, Labour can claim he “bottled” it. And, internally, pushing this line serves a “no complacency” purpose, ensuring the party is ready for May if it has to be.\nBurley was reflecting the conventional which is based on precedent, and the fact that in the postwar periods prime ministers facing likely election defeat have almost always delayed polling day for as long as possible. Even when No 10 is in permanent crisis, being prime minister is an extraordinarily exciting job and nothing else Sunak does in his life will ever feel quite so important. You don’t give it up lightly, and party leaders find it easy to convince themselves, Micawber style, that, if they wait six months, something might turn up.\nBut recently there has been a lot more talk about May being an option, fuelled by reports claiming that some in No 10 are pushing the idea.\nLast week, Steve Back, the photographer who covers Downing Street, and who specialises in long-lens shots showing what documents people are carrying as they enter No 10, posted these on X.\n\n\nA prediction from me !! Rishi will announce election 2024 on the 28th of March.— PoliticalPics (@PoliticalPics) February 28, 2024\n\n\n\nA prediction from me !! Rishi will announce election 2024 on the 28th of March.\n\nAnd, in reply to someone who asked if he was willing to bet on this (not Kay Burley), he replied:\n\nAs a non betting chap, I will stand you a few sherries in the Red Lion ! If and a big if am I wrong, not forgetting I see documents through my lens!!\n\nAnd in a report in the Mail on Sunday at the weekend Glen Owen and Anna Mikhailova said the thinking in Sunak’s circle is changing.\n\nUntil recently, Mr Sunak’s advisers were near-unanimous: leave the Election until the last possible moment to give the flagging economy time to pick up. However, the fraught buildup to Jeremy Hunt’s budget on Wednesday has cast doubt on the wisdom of this strategy.\nAs one pivotal figure said: ‘Six weeks ago we were looking at a £30bn pot to distribute in the form of eye-catching, potentially gamechanging tax cuts. Now, because of the rising cost of government borrowing, that has more than halved” …\nA well-connected MP said that autumn will be the time when bills arrive for issues such as the infected blood scandal, which could top £11bn, plus £2bn more for the victims of the Post Office miscarriages of justice, just as hundreds of thousands of voters are coming off fixed-rate mortgages and on to higher deals.\nThe MP added: ‘I’m definitely on Team May.’ As The Mail on Sunday reported last month, meetings have been held in government offices to make contingency arrangements for an Election on 2 May, the same day as the local elections.\nIf Mr Sunak went to the country on the same day it would at least avert any attempt by Tory MPs to oust him if the results are as bad as expected.\nThose on ‘Team May’ also point out that Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour is now divided over the Gaza conflict – as demonstrated by Mr Galloway’s victory over his party – and argue that the opinion polls are showing no sign of budging.\nIndeed, the legal migration figures due to be published at the end of May are expected to be ‘a horror show’, and with another summer of small boat crossings on the horizon, the party’s ratings could sink below the current 20 per cent to ‘extinction levels’, with the Tories even potentially being overtaken by Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.\n\nGreg Hands, the minister for London, was doing an interview round for the government this morning, and on Times Radio, when asked if he thought there was any prospect of a May election, he said no.\nHands is a former Conservative party chair. But he was sacked from this job in November and given a more junior ministerial job instead. If there is a secret No 10 plan for a May election, he is unlikely to know about it.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n9.30am: Andy Cooke, chief inspector at HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee.\n10am: Martin Lewis, the MoneySavingExpert founder and consumer champion, gives evidence to the Commons education committee about financial education. At 11am Damian Hinds, the education minister, gives evidence at 11am.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n11.30am: Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\n3.10pm: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, opens a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Lords.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "Martin Lewis, the financial advice expert, has accused the government of undermining his efforts to ensure children in England are taught about mortgages and credit cards, saying schools are suffering from a “poverty” of financial education. Addressing the education select committee, Lewis said the successful campaign he led in 2014 to add financial topics to the national curriculum has had little to show for it in the decade since. “Getting it on the curriculum was a pyrrhic victory. In some ways it was counterproductive,” Lewis told MPs. “We campaigned hard to get it on the national curriculum. We got it on the national curriculum in England. At that point, a lot of resources were pulled that had been voluntary and private sector. And then we had the change in the way that schools work – the academisation programmes, the free school movement – all of which means they don’t have to follow the national curriculum.   Related: The Money Saving Expert: how Martin Lewis became the most trusted man in Britain   “So the holy grail of trying to get it taught on a compulsory basis in every school, which is what getting on the curriculum was about, became self-defeating.” Lewis said that even those schools that did want to teach the topic were hampered by lack of resources and the failure to make the subject a high priority. “Frankly, the amount of resources the state and government has put in since then has been completely flaccid, and at a detrimental level. So while I can’t say that I regret we won the campaign at the time, I’m not sure it really changed the game in any way, because the rules were changed afterwards about what being on the national curriculum means, and I still think there is a real poverty of financial education in the UK. “Much of it comes down to a lack of resourcing for schools or lack of resourcing for teacher training and a lack of emphasis being put on this, for headteachers who are already overstretched.” Lewis said that where schools teach financial education, the topic is split between maths and citizenship classes. He called for schools to appoint a financial education coordinator to ensure it was being covered coherently in both areas. Damian Hinds, the schools minister, was asked by the committee if the government would expand financial education in primary schools to teach younger children. Hinds said there was already “explicitly” financial aspects of maths taught in infant school, but that there was a “further opportunity” to help teachers get better resources for the subject. “I want there to be more financial education. I would like for kids to say they had remembered it and had found it useful,” Hinds said."

        "content": "In rain-lashed Sunbury, a picturesque commuter town strung out along the swollen River Thames, there is scant enthusiasm for the Conservatives ahead of Jeremy Hunt’s much-trailed pre-election budget – even among the party’s erstwhile supporters. Dodging the puddles, barrister Simon Wheatley, 67, describes himself as “traditionally Conservative; at the moment, undecided”. “I suspect I am so presently disaffected that I probably won’t vote,” he adds. Asked whether Hunt could tempt him with budget giveaways on Wednesday, he sighs. “My fear is that it’s become terribly political, and not necessarily with an eye to long-term economy”. Outside a nearby parade of shops, a sprightly grandmother, who declines to be named, describes the “real quandary” she faces in the general election as a Conservative party member. Sunbury sits in the ex-briefly-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s constituency of Spelthorne, at the top of the M3. The 59-mile motorway, which carves its way south-west out of London, and in summer is thronged with weekenders heading for the New Forest and the coast, tells a tale of the UK’s changing political landscape. En route to the northern edge of Southampton, it passes through a string of other Tory seats, some of which have not changed hands for many years. These bustling commuter towns and cities, with their rural hinterlands, were not the battlegrounds of the last general election in 2019, when the action was concentrated hundreds of miles north, in the “red wall”. But while the Conservatives may well be safe in Spelthorne, where Kwarteng is stepping down, the election battles in at least three of the constituencies along the M3 corridor – Surrey Heath, Basingstoke and Winchester – will be hard-fought.  Prof Will Jennings, from Southampton University, an elections expert, says: “That sort of M3 corridor – call it the blue wall, call it just the south of England – is home to the sorts of demographic that are increasingly challenging for the Conservatives. “They used to be areas that were affluent, car-owning, employed. Those demographics, through the period of political change we’ve seen over the last five years, since Brexit, have drifted away from the Conservatives. It doesn’t mean all these seats are going to go red and orange but it does mean that the Conservatives are going to have some real fights on their hands.” A short drive down the M3 from Sunbury, at the Lib Dems’ constituency HQ in Camberley town centre, parliamentary candidate Al Pinkerton, an academic at Royal Holloway, University of London, is ready for one such battle. The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has not yet been confirmed as the candidate here, in his Surrey Heath constituency – but Pinkerton and his team have spoken to about 3,000 voters since the new year. He says they are hearing the same laments repeatedly – about the state of the NHS, the cost of living, sewage in the rivers, and a broader mistrust of politicians – including, he says, some people saying they will back the rightwing Reform party. “People used to say about Surrey, it was the old joke, stick a blue rosette on – insert farmyard animal here – and it would win. It’s just not the case. Even though we have fought hard for that change, it’s happened remarkably quickly.” He points to the change of control on Surrey Heath borough council, which the Lib Dems took over from the Tories last May, after a series of risky investments blew a hole in the finances.  Interactive  As to whether Hunt could win plaudits in a constituency like this one with a giveaway budget – evidently the hope at Westminster – Pinkerton is sceptical. “I don’t know, I don’t have a crystal ball. But when I speak to people, they have tax cuts baked into their thinking, and they reserve the right not to be persuaded by it.” Another half an hour south-west, the M3 skirts the southern edge of Basingstoke constituency, which has been Conservative since 1924, barring a year in the noughties when the sitting MP quixotically joined the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). Its MP, Maria Miller, calls Basingstoke the “economic powerhouse of Hampshire”. She points to recent government spending in the town, which has expanded dramatically in recent decades. And she highlights a statue of local hero Jane Austen – who spent more time there than in Bath, she says – which Miller raised the funds to erect. “We’ve had massive investment in our roads, in our schools. What we want to do now is to make sure that the NHS, which is probably the bit of public services that finds it most difficult to expand, can catch up,” she says. “What I think people in Basingstoke will be looking for from the budget is how they can get to keep more of the money they earn. The cost of living is a significant pressure in the south-east.” Some voters tell a different story. Just around the corner from the Austen statue, in the historic town centre, ultra-runner Adam McCartney, 40, has just bought a head-torch for a round-the-clock competition. “I feel like it’s got more run down, especially at this end of town. The shopping centre could do with filling up: that is a bleak place to be. When it first opened, every one of those units was filled, and now it’s very much not,” he says. “It’s been a steady decline. Over the past few years it feels like it’s accelerated. It feels like the incumbent Tory regime have just left it to it – they’ve abandoned it and thought, ‘there’s just enough there to keep people going, so we’ll leave them to it’.”  The newly selected Labour candidate, Luke Murphy, lists a by-now familiar series of issues that come up in his doorstep chats. “GP appointments, registering with dentists, the state of the top end of town. It’s just people’s day-to-day experience.” Murphy acknowledges he has a tough challenge if he wants to unseat Miller, pointing out that a Labour win here would be historic. The swing required, of 12.2%, is strikingly similar to the 12.7% average shift his party would need nationwide to win a majority, according to recent research by veteran election-watchers Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher. On a walkabout through the Festival Place shopping centre, Murphy is greeted by Deborah Reavell, 77, who says she is “excited” about the election, and highlights the gaps in NHS services. “Well, that’s universal isn’t it? You have to use Dr Google, and sort yourself out.” Twenty miles to the south-west of Basingstoke is the historic city of Winchester, home to the prestigious public school that educated Rishi Sunak. This affluent, semi-rural constituency returned a Labour MP in Clement Attlee’s postwar landslide, and was Lib Dem from 1997-2010, but since then has been solidly Tory. With boundary changes drawing in parts of neighbouring MP Flick Drummond’s seat, she will stand here for the Conservatives, while the incumbent, the former health minister Steve Brine, is standing down. Paul Morgan, the managing director of office supplies company Warrens Office, says Winchester is thriving. “I think we’re insulated from other parts of the UK because we’re only an hour from London,” he says, highlighting the bustling high street, increasingly a leisure destination. “I think a lot of people are high earners, connected with London. They may drive around in a 20-year-old Volvo but they’ve got cash on deposit and they’re insulated. So I think we’re not representative of the rest of the UK.” Despite being relatively upbeat about the outlook, he is scathing about the Tories’ record. “The Conservatives have lost the right to govern, based upon their current performance,” he says. “What the Conservatives have missed as an overarching principle is that they should be the party of lower taxes.” And while Morgan is no fan of Labour – “I can’t think of a situation where they’ve left the country, after a period of government, in a better state than when they started” – he thinks some voters here will either abstain, or switch to the Lib Dems. “But that’s not based on desire, it’s based on the least worst option.” The Lib Dem candidate, Danny Chambers, a vet who specialises in treating horses, says his many conversations with voters have highlighted the same concerns echoed up and down the M3 corridor – a deep mistrust of politicians and despair at the state of public services, especially the NHS – which appear unlikely to be patched up by a single budget, however generous. “They just feel taken for granted; they feel like no one’s ever knocked on their door before, no one’s ever cared. I think people are desperate for better public services, and that’s everything from roads that don’t have potholes in it, to a sewage system that’s not leaking stuff into rivers, to NHS care. People would rather get the mental health care they need for their kid, who’s struggling, or the social care for their grandad, than a tax cut.” Back on Winchester high street, Geoff Evans, 72, laments the current crop of politicians – on all sides – as the worst he’s seen in his lifetime. “Professional politicians, they haven’t got a clue. Half of them haven’t got the common sense they were born with,” he says. “I hate to say it, but the best thing, if it would ever be possible, is to bring back Margaret Thatcher.”"

        "content": "A senior Labour frontbencher has placed a bet on live television that Rishi Sunak will call a general election in May. Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, put his money where his mouth was on Tuesday when he agreed a £10 bet with the Sky News presenter Kay Burley that the election would be held in May. They shook hands, with Ashworth suggesting that the money should go to a charity for the children of alcoholics. “I think everything the Conservatives are doing in terms of both their advertising on social media and the political positioning suggests to me that May is their preferred choice,” Ashworth told Times Radio. “I think it’s going to be May. And I think Rishi Sunak now needs to name the date because there’s so much uncertainty. And businesses, companies seeking to invest in the UK economy need certainty, which is why I’m challenging Rishi Sunak to offer that certainty and confirm a May election.” The prime minister said in January that he was working on the assumption that he would call a general election “in the second half of this year”. However, the Guardian understands that Labour has been readying its plans to put the party on a battle footing for a poll sooner than the end of the year and that frontbenchers received a presentation by strategists last week on the possibility of a May election. Leaving the election until later in the year holds out the possibility of the Conservatives being able to garner some support if interest rates fall further. However, the argument for calling on in May is premised on the notion that things can only get worse for the Conservatives if they wait. The party’s support has fallen to the lowest level in more than four decades, according to an Ipsos poll, which put support for the Tories at 20% at the end of February, down seven percentage points in a month. Labour was on 47%. Greg Hands, the minister for London and minister of state for trade policy, replied “no” when asked on Times Radio on Tuesday if he believed there was a chance of an election being called in May. The former chancellor George Osborne has said that Sunak is planning a general election on 14 November, as the prime minister seeks to maximise the amount of time he has to recover the Conservatives’ poll deficit. Speaking on Political Currency, the podcast he hosts with the former Labour cabinet minister Ed Balls, Osborne said he had been told Sunak’s team was working towards the date in mid-November as the target for an election. “My working assumption is that we will have a general election in the second half of this year,” Sunak said in January, using a phrase that might give him some room to change his mind should circumstances change. However, he has since been sheepish when quizzed by broadcasters to name the date."

        "content": "Downing Street is facing a backlash from Conservative MPs and peers over moves to create a broader of definition of extremism in response to what Rishi Sunak describes as the threat of “mob rule”. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, is expected to unveil plans next week that would allow the government, universities and local authorities to cut off links to groups identified as “extremist”. Organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain and protest groups such as Palestine Action are among those that could be affected by the non-statutory move to block groups from funding or accessing venues if they are regarded as promoting an ideology that undermines “British values”. The plan was reported by the Observer last year. A minister said on Tuesday that he would not be happy if, for example, gender-critical feminists were labelled as extremists by a change of government policy. The trade minister Greg Hands told Times Radio that the prime minister had talked about taking on extremism and the government needed to work on definitions. “The communities secretary, Michael Gove, is doing that right now. More work is being done. But obviously we need to target real extremism and not just a difference of views, honestly held views about these things,” he added.  The rightwing Tory MP Miriam Cates and Lord Frost, the high-profile rightwing peer, are among those who have expressed opposition amid concerns that the move could have an inadvertent impact on anti-abortion groups, advocates for socially conservative causes and those opposed to transgender rights. “Any attempt to define extremism or fundamental British values is very risky because one person’s extremism is another person’s sincerely held and lawful belief,” Cates told the Guardian. “An obvious is example is where I regularly call trans rights activists extremists for believing a man can be a woman just because he says he is, and that this gives him the right to enter women-only spaces, but equally I am called an extremist for believing there are only two biological sexes and that you can’t change sex.” “These are debates that we should be able to have lawfully in society. We should be able to call each other extremists, but it also means those views should not be banned,” said the MP, one of the leaders of the New Conservatives grouping of Tory MPs. In a move that also raises the prospect of unusual alliances emerging between those who might disagree on other issues but who are united by hostility to the proposals, Cates said she would be raising her concerns with the government and other MPs Frost, Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator, said on X that he was “very much” in agreement with a tweet by Cates who had used the platform to say that a “broader definition of extremism” was not needed. “What we need is proper enforcement of the laws we have against, for example, incitement to violence,” added Frost. The proposals come after a speech outside Downing Street last Friday in which Sunak claimed extremist groups in the UK were “trying to tear us apart”. In a statement that came hours after George Galloway won a byelection in Rochdale, the prime minister said: “You cannot be part of our civic life if your agenda is to tear it down.” The address contained no detail of new policies, save for a pledge that the government would “redouble” support for the Prevent counter-terrorism programme, demand that universities stop extremist activity on campus and take action on extremists entering the UK. Ministers are also considering proposals to ban MPs and councillors from engaging with groups such as the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil. The plans, put forward by the government’s adviser on political violence, John Woodcock, say mainstream political leaders should tell their representatives to employ a “zero-tolerance approach” to groups that use disruptive tactics or fail to stop “hate” on marches. A spokesperson for Palestine Action, a direct action group that has been among those which reports have suggested could be identified as extremist, said any change would not stop its activists and that it was continuing to draw support. “There have been attempts before to define extremism before and it did not work, but when we are talking about British values as they are I refuse to believe that it amounts to supporting genocide in Gaza,” she told the Guardian. “If anything, the recent announcements show that lobbying politicians and going on marches have failed to change this country’s stance on Israel. The group’s main targets are the sites of an Israeli arms manufacturer. One of its co-founders who went on trial last year with others for damaging Elbit Systems Limited’s UK sites said they were justified because they were trying to stop people being bombed."

        "content": "British negotiators have flown to India in a last-ditch attempt to clinch a trade deal amid concerns that Narendra Modi’s administration intends to hold out for a Labour government. A team of negotiators led by a senior civil servant flew out on Monday with a mandate to resolve the goods and services chapters, which are among the thorniest outstanding issues in the talks. Boris Johnson and Liz Truss also sought to secure a multibillion pound free-trade agreement (FTA) with India, a booming economy of 1.4 billion people. It is seen as one of the biggest Brexit prizes. A UK government official said the British delegation was making a “last-gasp attempt to clinch an FTA before the Indian election campaign pauses talks”. But they added: “UK negotiators are hearing from India that they will get more out of Labour on visas and social security. That has been the impact of Labour’s trip to India and meeting with trade minister, Piyush Goyal.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, met Goyal during a trip to Delhi last month. His visit rankled with government figures who are concerned that India may decide to hold out until after the UK general election in the hopes of getting a better deal from Keir Starmer’s government. Labour is projected to win a majority. Visas and social security are among the most politically sensitive parts of the proposed deal. India wants to secure more visas for Indian workers and an agreement to claw back social security payments they make while working in the UK. Visas are especially tricky for Rishi Sunak, because Conservative MPs are deeply concerned about net migration into the UK, which hit a record high in 2022. Some figures around the business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, are increasingly pessimistic about the India deal and see a free-trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council as being within closer reach. Badenoch met trade ministers from all six GCC countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – in Abu Dhabi last week. The UK-India negotiations have been in the final stages for weeks, and both sides are now privately warning that time is running out before India’s general election campaign begins. India’s election is expected to take place in April or May. The electoral commission is expected to set an exact date in the next few weeks, and trade talks will be suspended once the campaign begins. If the UK election happens this spring, the next few weeks may be Sunak’s last chance to finalise an agreement. But if, as expected, it happens in the autumn, there is a narrow window for a deal to be agreed over the summer. The UK and India are currently in their 14th round of negotiations, which began on 10 January. Johnson had originally hoped to sign an agreement by Diwali in October 2022. A spokesperson for the Department of Business and Trade said: “We have always been clear we will only sign a deal that is fair, balanced and ultimately in the best interests of the British people and the economy. The UK and India continue to work towards an ambitious trade deal that works for both countries.” A Labour spokesperson said: “No negotiations have taken place between the Labour party and the Indian government. If the UK government fail to deliver on another one of their promises, they have only themselves to blame. Labour will always value and seek to deepen the connections between our two great trading nations.”"

        "content": "Until George Galloway’s Rochdale byelection win, few may have taken notice of the Workers party beyond those intrigued by the minutiae of the far left. Others may have flicked through some of its literature, such as “Ukraine and the origins of the special military operation”, a 44-page pamphlet using Vladimir Putin’s term for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and echoing Kremlin talking points on the conflict. But the win last week has suddenly catapulted it to national prominence as a vehicle for challenges that could deprive Labour of votes in scores of constituencies where anger at Keir Starmer’s stance on Gaza may now have a focus.   Related: George Galloway targets Angela Rayner’s seat after he is sworn in as MP   In some cases the challengers will be Workers party candidates attempting to piggyback on Galloway’s success. Galloway’s first speech in London since becoming an MP again will be not in parliament but in Lewisham on Tuesday in support of his party’s candidate for borough mayor. In other cases it will be independents backed by the party. Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who represented the family of Shamima Begum, is backed by the Workers party in a challenge to Labour’s Rushanara Ali in Tower Hamlets. The party is also supporting Andrew Feinstein, a former ANC MP in South Africa, in his challenge to Keir Starmer in Holborn and St Pancras, although Galloway said he may yet be moved to “a more winnable constituency”. Feinstein, who resigned from Labour in recent weeks, is considering standing but is currently engaged in consulting with local community groups. “Our party has doubled in the last two weeks and the number of people applying to be candidates has grown massively,” Galloway said, adding that most were former Labour members apart from “one or two further to the left”. While the Workers party originally thought it would stand about 50 candidates, it was now on course to field as many as 90, while Galloway said negotiations would take place with “well-placed independents”. “It’s our job to take chunks out of Labour, and it’s our intention to replace Labour,” he said. Formed in 2019 in an effort to pick up disaffected former Labour members who had supported Jeremy Corbyn, the Workers party drew on the support of the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist), or CPGB-ML, a tiny Stalinist grouping that came with some personnel as well as links to China in particular. CPGB-ML would later withdraw from the Workers party, and the latter has continued to recruit figures with slivers of support on Britain’s political fringes. Chris Williamson, the former Labour MP who was suspended from that party in a row over antisemitism and who now presents a show on Iran’s Press TV channel, joined last year. He is joint deputy leader along with Andy Hudd, a trade unionist who has represented Aslef members, and Peter Ford, a former British ambassador to Syria whose criticism of western states’ policy in the Middle East and hostility to Nato has found a home in the party. While Gaza has been the catalyst for the Galloway breakthrough and is likely to be a central rallying cry, the party is seeking to build a leftwing identity at odds with the supposed leftwing metropolitan elite behind Labour. A red, white and blue symbol in the shape of a cog combines a nod to patriotism and the notion of an industrial working class. On other foreign policy fronts, the party is starkly at odds with the UK political mainstream, and unafraid to publicise it. In the week that Galloway won in Rochdale, a Workers party delegation was taking part in the ‘World Festival of Youth’ in Russia. Though not a Workers party member, another key figure in Galloway’s orbit is James Giles, a London councillor who leads the Kingston Independent Residents Group and who was his campaign manager in Rochdale. Giles says there has been a spate of councils where independents have taken over as the main opposition. “Most of these people are on the left or are looking for a genuine left alternative, and also have a very strong anti-war belief,” he said. The alliance between the Workers party and independents could also be critical to the political fate of Corbyn, who faces a challenge in holding on to his Islington North seat. The former Labour leader would have been walking Galloway into the Commons chamber when the latter was sworn in as an MP but had forgotten he had a prior commitment, Galloway told the media on Monday, suppressing a smile. Giles said Galloway would “absolutely” be backing Corbyn in Islington, and the two men will be working together in parliament. • This article was amended on 6 March 2024 to clarify that Andrew Feinstein is considering standing in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency but is still consulting on this."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-03-04T18:59:50+00:00",
        "content": "Angela Rayner has faced questions over the last two weeks on whether she was liable to pay capital gains tax (CGT) on the sale of her former council house before she became an MP. Labour’s deputy leader has said there is no case to answer and has dismissed a string of stories in the Mail on Sunday based on claims in a book by Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory deputy chair, as a “constant stream of smears”. But she is coming under pressure to explain her personal financial affairs after a series of reports in the newspaper suggested she still had questions to answer. What’s the background to the story? Rayner lived in rented council properties before moving to one on Vicarage Road, Stockport. It is unclear when she moved there. In January 2007, the then mother of one who worked as a local council care worker and union official for Unison bought the £79,000 property using the right-to-buy scheme first brought in by Margaret Thatcher in 1979. As a result of the scheme she got a 25% discount off the property’s asking price, equating to £26,000. A year after buying her first home Rayner had her second child, her first with then partner Mark Rayner, a Unison official. He already owned a home at Lowndes Lane, about a mile away. Their son was born prematurely at 23 weeks and spent eight months in intensive care. Rayner has said she required continuing support from a wide network of friends and family, including her brother, during this period. The couple decided to keep their separate properties during this period. It is unclear which property was her main residence or whether they lived apart. In 2010, the pair got married, a year after having their second child. For the eight years she owned the Vicarage Road property, Rayner was registered on the electoral roll there. She was not registered to vote elsewhere and did not rent out the property during this time. In March 2015, Rayner sold her home for £127,500, making a profit of £48,500. At this point, she was registered at this address on the electoral roll, until her husband sold his home in 2016. What questions does she now face? Homeowners have to pay capital gains tax after they have sold a home that has increased in value – but they are exempt if it is their main full-time residence. Substantial improvement costs can also be deducted from a homeowner’s CGT bill. Married couples who both have individual properties can only have one main residence between them under tax law. When reports about her property first emerged Rayner tweeted: “As with the majority of ordinary people who sell their own homes, I was not liable for capital gains tax because it was my home and the only one I owned.” Sources close to her suggested that her thread on X was a “shorthand” account but it prompted further scrutiny from the media and tax experts on her understanding of her responsibilities under tax law. According to Ashcroft’s unofficial biography, Rayner re-registered the births of the two sons she had with Mark to her husband’s house in 2010. It is unclear which address was on their birth certificates previously. As a result of the reports, Rayner has faced questions about where she lived for the first five years of her marriage, as under electoral rules voters are expected to register at their permanent address and could face penalties for providing false information. Dan Neidle, a tax expert, said: “Mark and Angela either nominated her property as their joint main residence so he (Mark) had tax to pay and she didn’t. Or a lot of building work was done on her property. “I don’t think this is a very big issue, I don’t think there’s much tax to pay and I’m uncomfortable with forcing MPs to divulge their personal financial information. “But seeing as this has got out into the public domain, it seems sensible for her to provide information otherwise people’s imaginations will conjure scenarios that are much worse than the reality.” The reports also raised questions about Rayner’s purchase of her home under right-to-buy rules, which state tenants can only apply to buy their council house if it is their “only or main home”. Is this damaging for Rayner? Rayner has partly explained her family’s circumstances and said she had taken expert tax and legal advice, although it is not clear when, which told her that she had not been liable to pay CGT on the sale of her Vicarage Road home. Keir Starmer has backed his deputy, saying he has “full confidence in all of the answers she has given” on her tax affairs.  Tory MPs have already accused Rayner of “staggering hypocrisy” for wanting to reform Thatcher’s flagship policy as she had “personally benefited from the right-to-buy discount”. Tory party sources say they believe there is evidence of potential wrongdoing and intend to continue asking awkward questions in the run-up to the general election, believing they have found a weak spot.

There’s a House of Commons resolution dating back to 1688 that requires a new MP to be introduced by two current MPs at their swearing in. So all eyes were on who had drawn the short straw to stand with George Galloway. One early contender had been the Tory MP David Davis, who takes his libertarian principles seriously. He may not like what you say, but he believes in your right to say it. But even he melted away after the prime minister’s deranged rant outside Downing Street on Friday evening. These days you can be found guilty of crimes against humanity in Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party for even thinking of observing parliamentary convention by coming to someone like Galloway’s aid. Davis has now been sent to the gulags for 20 years re-education. The other MP who had been in the frame was Jeremy Corbyn. He and Galloway go back decades. Old muckers from way back. What could possibly go wrong? “Oh, you meant this Monday at 2.30pm? I could have sworn you said next Monday. I am so, so sorry but I seem to be double booked.” That was more or less the message Jezza sent Galloway some time over the weekend. George didn’t seem entirely convinced by the sincerity of the apology. It seems that even long-term critics of Starmer’s Labour party have their breaking point. Being seen to endorse Galloway might not help Corbyn’s chances of re-election. George was doing his best not to let it get to him. He wasn’t a man who held grudges. Much. Back to square one then. Wanted. Two MPs prepared to put principle before party. Step forward the Conservative MP Peter Bottomley. He had no skin in the game and as father of the house it fell to him to take one for the team. He would do it in the interests of democracy. Just so long as no one imagined he derived any pleasure from it. The Alba MP Neale Hanvey was a little more forthcoming. He had never met Galloway before. Might never speak to him again in the future. But the people of Rochdale had a right to be represented in parliament. So straight after prayers, the three men stood in a line at the bar of the house. The clerk summoned Galloway, and Bottomley and Hanvey drifted back to the seats. Everyone else in the Commons waiting for the start of the levelling up departmental questions studied their phones diligently. Or put on the expression of someone doing their best to look as if they weren’t really there. This was dirty business. Something far, far beneath them. Galloway strode forward. Without his trademark Fedora. He insists that he only wears the hat to hide the injuries he received when he was attacked in the street by a man wearing a T-shirt with an Israel Defense Forces logo. But the doctors have done a good job on him and there were no scars on show. So it’s just possible that the hat is also an affectation. George wouldn’t be the first MP to suffer from a surfeit of vanity. Wherever he goes, his giant ego is there before him. Like most narcissists, the only fool for whom he makes allowances – for whom he has a total blindspot – is himself. It was all over in a matter of seconds. Galloway held the Bible in one hand and swore allegiance to the king. No cameo winks for the cameras. Just straightforward as if he meant it. Then he’s had a lot of practice. Over a 37-year political career he’s been MP for Glasgow Hillhead, Glasgow Kelvin, Bethnal Green and Bow, Bradford West and Rochdale. For three different parties. He is a man forever looking forward. Not one to indulge in remorse. Il ne regrette rien. Nor does he feel the need to make amends. Just move on and leave the wreckage to whoever follows. His primary loyalty always has been to himself. For Sunak, Galloway’s byelection victory had been the end of days. Kiss goodbye to democracy. Though you might have thought he would have been thrilled. Finally he had a Public Enemy Number One. Someone on whom to pin all his extremist hate. George was Rish!’s acceptable face of Islamophobia. Dislike George and you would be given a free pass – a papal indulgence – on your hatred of all Muslims. Sunak’s pleas for a more open, inclusive society have always been decidedly one-sided. We all get to hate the foreigners Sunak wants us to hate. And the thing is, there is a lot about Galloway to dislike. His self-importance is breathtaking. Most MPs suffer from an excess of self-regard, but George is off the scale. It has never crossed his mind that he is not right about everything. If there are angels – and George is Catholic so there certainly are – then they are on his side. Getting the order of primacy here is vital. In all things political – in all things spiritual – it is George who is doing God the favour here. Not the other way round. He’s barely even got time for the angels. Speak to the hand and all that. But the reality is that Galloway owes his election to the success of the democratic system. Not its failure. Labour screwed up big time – they are the real villains here – and Rochdale would rather have Galloway or an independent than a Tory. Who could blame them. Democracy did not come undone. It triumphed. No one died. Rochdale got what it asked for. As it will at the next election when Galloway will probably be just a little wrinkle in history. In search of yet another constituency to disappoint.   Related: Writing off George Galloway ignores his dangerous appeal to both far left and right | Michael Chessum   Until then, it’s George Time. And he’s going to make the most of it. Worried he may not be able to get many opportunities to speak in parliament, he chose to hold court for a gaggle of hacks looking for a story on a slow news day. So the Ego had Landed. Was in its element. First boasting about how he was far brighter and had served far longer than either Sunak or Starmer. He may be right, though he should aim higher. Then setting out his campaign to get Rochdale its own postcode. That’s the last anyone will hear of this. Next it was on to questions from the media. Here was his opportunity to settle scores and gratuitously insult whoever he liked. This was George living the dream. Sometimes he even forgets which side he’s on. Other than his own. He offers something for everyone on the extremes. Both the far right and far left can find something to love. His party – the Workers’ Party of Britain (current membership into at least two figures) – would take out Angela Rayner and the Labour elite. He alone could save the UK in its hour of need. All other MPs were intellectual minnows. Israel had no right to exist in perpetuity. Neither did the UK. He alone was blessed with the truth. He wouldn’t admit to past mistakes because he had never made any. Cue a couple of sideswipes at the BBC and GB News. Also Richard Tice. With Galloway you’re only ever a couple of law suits away from martyrdom. He was loving this. The presence of the media proved he still had it. He mattered. He was back. Though whether he would notice if there was no one there is another matter. For George the song always remains the same. My Song."

        "content": "George Galloway has said he will target more seats in the next general election including the deputy Labour leader’s after his swearing-in at Westminster following last week’s Rochdale byelection victory.\nSpeaking outside parliament, Galloway singled out Angela Rayner’s constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne, where she is defending a majority of 4,263, as an example of where his Workers Party of Britain, or a candidate backed by it, could cause havoc for her chances of re-election.\n“There’s at least 15,000 supporters of my point of view in her constituency. So we’ll be putting a candidate up against her, either a Workers party candidate or more likely an independent camp candidate that we support, and that will vitally affect the election of the nearby deputy leader,” he said.\n“And there are many constituencies in London, from Ilford to Bethnal Green in the heart of the City of London, in Birmingham, in other parts of the West Midlands, in north-west England, in the towns around Rochdale, Oldham, Blackburn, Burnley, Nelson, Bury. We’ll be putting candidates up in all these places and we will either win or we will make sure that Keir Starmer doesn’t.”\nEarlier on Monday afternoon Galloway was sworn in and escorted into the Commons chamber by two sponsors, the Conservative MP and father of the house, Peter Bottomley, and Neale Hanvey of Scotland’s Alba party.\nGalloway, a former Labour MP, promised to work with the Scottish National party to force another vote on Gaza, compared Israel’s actions to the Holocaust and predicted his party and other independents would tap into anger over the conflict to alter the course of the election.\nHe was watched from the public gallery by his wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, and a small group of others including James Giles, a London councillor who leads the Kingston Independent Residents party and was involved in the Rochdale campaign.\nGalloway, who won almost 40% of the vote in last Thursday’s vote after a campaign centred on the conflict in Gaza, held a copy of the Bible as he swore an oath of allegiance to the king, before shaking hands with the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, and leaving the chamber.\nSpeaking afterwards to the media, Galloway borrowed from a Trumpian political slogan, saying: “It’s my job to try to make Rochdale great again.” He said he would attempt to speak either during prime minister’s questions or in the debate on the chancellor’s budget statement on Wednesday.\nHe chided journalists for their coverage of his campaign and his focus on Gaza, saying: “If the byelection had been in February of 1940 or 41 would anyone seriously have condemned me for putting the crimes of the Holocaust at the centre of my election campaign?\n“And yet the same fourth estate seemed or pretended to find it inexplicable that I would put a genocide in Gaza in front of the voters in a byelection in 2024.”\nGalloway also took aim at Rishi Sunak, claiming the prime minister had really just been “speaking about Muslims” during his address outside Downing Street in which the Conservative leader warned of a threat to democracy. This was the imminent theme of his election campaign, said Galloway, who accused Sunak’s party of “whipping up Islamophobic racist fervour” with the assistance of the broadcaster GB News.\nHis return to the Commons means he will have represented five different constituencies: Glasgow Hillhead, Glasgow Kelvin, Bethnal Green and Bow, Bradford West, and Rochdale."

        "content": "\n 6.13pm GMT \nEarly evening summary\n\n\nRishi Sunak has suffered three defeats in the House of Lords over his Rwanda bill. The government lost the first two by majorities of 102, and in the third division, which has just finished, the government lost by a majority of 110. Further votes are due as the debate carries on tonight, and there will be another report stage debate on the bill, with votes on amendments, on Wednesday. (See 4.50pm and 5.58pm.)\n\n\nDowning Street has criticised the BBC presenter Chris Packham after he defended Just Stop Oil’s right to protest outside the homes of MPs.\n\n\nGeorge Galloway has been sworn in as the MP for Rochdale as parliament returned for the first time since the Workers party leader’s byelection win last week.\n\n\nUnder a Labour government there would be “no option of a life on benefits”, the party has said, as it set out plans to reduce the number of young people not in work, education or training.\n\n\n\n\n 5.58pm GMT \nSunak suffers second defeat as peers say bill cannot treat Rwanda as safe until treaty provisions implemented\n\nThe government has lost a second vote in the Lords on the Rwanda bill. Lord Hope’s amendment was passed by a majority of 102. It says the government cannot treat Rwanda as a safe country until the provisions of the UK-Rwanda treaty have been implemented.\n\nUpdated at 5.58pm GMT\n\n\n 5.53pm GMT \n\nTom Pursglove, the Home Office minister, prompted laughter from MPs in the Commons earlier after he claimed the government publishing a stack of Home Office reports had led to ministers “being criticised for doing precisely what it is they said they would do”, PA Media reports.\nResponding to the urgent question from Dame Diana Johnson, Labour chair of the home affairs committee, Pursglove said:\n\nI have to say it is rather surprising that ministers are being criticised for doing precisely what it is they said they would do.\nWe said, and actually I was pressed on this a couple of times, and I was asked when these reports would be laid, I said that that would happen soon. I then subsequently said that that would happen very soon and that commitment was fulfilled.\n\nJohnson pointed out that home affairs correspondents, including from pro-Tory papers like the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, have written to the Home Office to complain about the publication of so much important material all at once.\n\n\n\n 5.44pm GMT \n\nBack in the Lords Lord Offord, minister for exports, told peers that the government would not be implementing the Rwanda bill until Rwanda has enacted the changes to its immigration system mandated by the new treaty. He argued that this made Lord Hope’s amendment (see 5.07pm) unnecessary. But Hope said he was going to push it to a vote anyway, and peers are voting now.\n\n\n\n 5.38pm GMT \n\nToday’s Ipsos poll suggests that the Labour lead over the Conservative went up by 5 points from January to February, reaching 27 points at the end of last week. (See 11.17am.)\nBut Deltapoll has some better figures for the Tories. Its lastest polling suggests the Labour lead fell by seven points over the course of last week, and that it is now “only” 14 points.\n\n\n🚨🚨New Voting Intention🚨🚨Labour lead narrows to fourteen points in the latest results from Deltapoll.

(See 11.17am.) It’s here.\nAnd here is a chart suggesting that Rachel Reeves now has a bigger lead over Jeremy Hunt on who would be the most capable chancellor than she or any other shadow chancellor has had at any point since 2010.\nA reader asked about the SNP in the Ipsos polling. Ipsos did not mention the SNP figures in their press release this morning, because GB-wide polls aren’t a reliable guide to the situation in Scotland, but voters in Scotland were polled, and the SNP numbers are in the tables. You can read them here.\n\n\n\n 5.09pm GMT \n\nLord Deben (John Gummer), the former Tory cabinet minister, spoke up in favour of the amendment. He said he objected to the current text of the bill because it required peers to assert that Rwanda was a safe country, when the reforms to its immigration system mandated by the new treaty have not necessarily been implemented.\n\n\n\n 5.07pm GMT \n\nIn the Lords peers have now started debating the next set of amendments to the Rwanda bill, which all deal with ensuring that Rwanda implements the reforms to its immigration system promised in the treaty with the UK signed after the supreme court ruling.\nLord Hope of Craighead, a former deputy president of the supreme court and the convenor of the crossbench peers, has moved the lead amendment in this group. His lead one, amendment 4, changes the bill so that Rwanda is only treated as a safe country “when, and so long as, the arrangements provided for in the Rwanda Treaty have been fully implemented and are being adhered to in practice”.\nIn his speech, Hope said he would push this to a vote if he was not satisfied by the assurances he got from the minister.\nLord Hodgson, a Conservative, spoke next. He said Hope’s amendment would render the bill, if not unworkable, at least inoperable.\n\n\n\n 4.50pm GMT \nSunak suffers defeat on Rwanda bill as peers vote by 102 majority to insist it must be compliant with international law\n\nThe opposition won the vote by a huge margin. Amendment 2, intended to ensure the Rwanda bill is fully compliant with international law (see 4.40pm), was passed by 274 votes to 172 – a majority of 102.\nThis is the government’s first defeat on the bill.\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm GMT\n\n\n 4.40pm GMT \nPeers vote on amendment to ensure Rwanda bill fully compliant with rule of law\n\nShami Chakrabarti, who tabled some of the amendments being debated in this stage of the report stage debate, closes the debate on “rule of law” amendments with a short speech accusing Michael Howard (see 4.11pm) and Lord Stewart (see 4.31pm) of “gaslighting” peers with their comments about the House of Lords.\n(The two Tory peers made contradictory arguments, with Howard saying the bill was rectifying a mistake made by the Lords, and Stewart insisting the bill was just implementing the court’s wishes.)\nChakrabarti withdraws her amendment saying that instead she would like to see peers vote on the simpler one tabled by the Labour party, in the name of Lord Coaker. This is amendment 2 and it adds a line to the bill saying that it will take effect “while maintaining full compliance with domestic and international law”.\nPeers are voting on this now.\nIn a note describing the purpose of the amendment, Coaker says “it seeks to ensure that the eventual Act is fully compliant with the rule of law”.\n\n\n\n 4.31pm GMT \n\nLord Stewart of Dirleton, the advocate general for Scotland, is speaking for the government in the Lords debate. He says he does not accept that the government is ignoring the supreme court ruling on the Rwanda policy with this legislation. Instead, because of the treaty with Rwanda that goes alongside the bill, putting the Rwandan government under an obligation to implement the reforms required by the supreme court, the government is acting on the supreme court’s concerns, he says. \n\n\n\n 4.23pm GMT \n\nHere are some more comments from peers speaking in the Lords debates on “rule of law” amendments to the Rwanda bill.\nLady D’Souza, a crossbencher and former Lords speaker, said the bill was a “legal fiction” because it was “writing into law a demonstrably false statement that Rwanda is a safe country to receive asylum seekers and thereby forcing all courts to treat Rwanda as a safe country, despite clear findings of fact”.\nLabour’s Shami Chakrabarti told peers that the opposition wanted the bill changed to ensure compliance with international law.\nKen Clarke, the Tory former chancellor, said he was opposed to the bill, and hoped it would be challenged in the courts. He said:\n\nI can’t recall a precedent in my time where a government of any complexion has produced a bill which asserts facts, a matter of facts, facts to be fact, and then goes on to say that this should be regarded legally as a fact interminably until and unless the bill is changed, and then goes on to say that no court should even consider any question of the facts being otherwise.\nIt’s no good blaming the Human Rights Act, I do not think it probable that the British courts were going to come to any other conclusion.\nAnd if the Labour party allow this bill to go through, I very much hope there will be a legal challenge, and the supreme court will consider it obviously objectively again.” would ensure compliance with the rule of law.\n\n\n\n\n 4.11pm GMT \n\nMichael Howard, the former Conservative party leader and former home secretary, told peers in the Rwanda bill debate that the supreme court was not entitled to rule that Rwanda was not safe as a country, because that was a decision for government. He said all the government was doing with its bill was restoring its right to take this decision for itself. He explained:\n\nIn resolving to decide this issue for itself, the supreme court was trespassing on the province of the executive and, if there is any breach of the principle of separation of powers in this matter, it is not the government that is guilty, it is the supreme court.\nAll the government is doing in this bill is to reassert its responsibility, as traditionally understood by the principle of the separation of powers, for executive decision-making. And there is a reason why it is the government, and not the courts, which has that responsibility. It is because it is the government, and not the courts, which is accountable. The courts is accountable to no one – they pride themselves on that.\nBut accountability is at the heart of democracy. That is why the government is fully entitled to bring forward this bill and why much of the criticism which is directed at it for doing so is, for the reasons I have given, fundamentally misconceived.\n\n\n\n\n 4.05pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 3.57pm GMT \n\nIn the House of Lords peers have started their debate on the report stage of the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration). The list of amendments is here, and peers are currently debating amendment 1, a cross-party amendment intended to ensure the bill’s compliance with domestic and international law, and other “rule of law” amendments.\nJustin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, is speaking now. He defends the case of underlining the importance of complying with international law, because he says international law is there to stop governments doing things that are wrong.\n\nUpdated at 4.12pm GMT\n\n\n 3.48pm GMT \n\nThe Alba MP Neale Hanvey has said he was happy to sponsor George Galloway (see 2.43pm) when Galloway took his seat in the Commons. This is from Georgia Roberts from BBC Scotland.\n\n\nAlba’s @JNHanvey says he was happy to introduce Galloway in Commons: “Refusing to support any new member is not only a parliamentary discourtesy, it is an insult to the electorate and their democratic voice. Such schoolyard behaviour has no place in a functioning democracy.”— Georgia Roberts (@GeorgiaZemoreyR) March 4, 2024\n\n\n\nAlba’s @JNHanvey says he was happy to introduce Galloway in Commons:“Refusing to support any new member is not only a parliamentary discourtesy, it is an insult to the electorate and their democratic voice. Such schoolyard behaviour has no place in a functioning democracy.”\n\n\n\n\n 3.43pm GMT \nKendall says 'hidden unemployment' caused by people being ill takes real joblessness rate to 20% in some places\n\nLiz Kendall’s speech this morning was described by Labour as her first major speech in her role since she became shadow work and pensions secretary last September. But anyone expecting new policy, or at least fresh thinking on welfare issues, will have been disappointed. In this respect it was a blank sheet.\nBut some of the rhetoric was interesting, and it did include a compelling critique of the government.\n\nKendall argued that “hidden unemployment” caused by people not working because they are ill takes the unemployment rate up to 20% in some places. She said:\n\n\nWe are the only country in the G7 whose employment rate hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe reality is, increasing numbers of people are leaving the labour market and no longer even looking for work.\nThis parliament has seen the highest increase in economic inactivity for 40 years.\nAnd the number of people out of work because of long term sickness is at an all-time high.\n2.8 million people not in work because of poor health.\nThe over 50s: mostly women, struggling with bad hips, knees and joints; often caring for elderly parents at the same time.\nYoung people with mental health problems; many lacking basic qualifications.\nWith all these problems far worse in Northern towns and cities, which the Conservatives promised to ‘level up’ but have once again born the brunt of their economic failure.\nIn places like Blackburn, Sunderland, Middlesborough and Hull, including these ‘hidden unemployed’ takes the official unemployment rate from 5 to 20 per cent.\nThis is unacceptable.\n\n\nShe said benefits for sick people would soon cost more than spending on defence. She said:\n\n\nFor all the Tory claims about being tough on benefits, over the next five years there will be 600,000 more people on incapacity and disability benefits and these benefits will cost an extra £33bn.\nThat’s more than our day-to-day expenditure on defence.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility says the sustained rise in health-related worklessness is holding back growth and living standards while putting ever greater pressure on the public finances.\nYet all we get from the Tories is more of the same.\n\n\nShe said that 200,000 people aged 24 or younger are out of work due to ill health – double the number a decade ago – and she listed Labour policies that would help them. The plans include: specialist mental health support in every school, 1,000 new career advisers in schools, technical excellence colleges for skills training, a growth and skills levy replacing the much-criticised apprenticeship levy, employment advisers in Young Futures hubs and and overhaul of the access to work support scheme for young disabled people.\n\n\nShe said Labour would not allow young people to choose a life on benefits. She said:\n\n\nThis is our commitment to young people.\nWe will invest in you and help you build a better future, with all the chances and choices this brings.\nBut in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that’s on offer.\nUnder our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.\nNot just because the British people believe rights should go hand in hand with responsibilities.\nBut because being unemployed or lacking basic qualifications when you’re young can harm your job prospects and wages for the rest of your life.\nThis isn’t good enough for young people or for our country.\nUnlike the Tories, Labour will not let a generation of young people go off track before they’ve even begun.\n\nThis was almost identical to the sort of language used by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when they launched their new deal for working people before the 1997 election. But under current rules there are conditions attached to benefits – healthy people cannot just choose “a life on benefits” without having to show they are looking for work etc – and Kendall did not propose any changes to the way sanctions work.\n\n\n\n 3.28pm GMT \nGalloway says he will run candidate against Angela Rayner at general election, and claims he could cost Labour many seats\n\nGalloway claims the fact that journalists have turned up for his al fresco press conference show that they realise he is not just a one-off, and that he represents a large number of people.\nHe says Angela Rayner has a majority of just 3,000. But there are 15,000 people in her constituency who support his point of view. He says he will put up a candidate against her – either a Workers Party of Britain candidate, or someone with the same point of view.\nAnd he says there are many other constituencies that are similar,\n\nThere are many constituencies in London … Bethnal Green in the heart of the City of London, in Birmingham, in other parts of the West Midlands, in north-west England, in the towns around Rochdale, Oldham, Blackburn, Burnley, Nelson, Bury.\nWe’ll be putting candidates up in all these places and we will either win or we’ll make sure that Keir Starmer doesn’t win.\n\n\n\n\n 3.21pm GMT \n\nGalloway says Rishi Sunak is using protest as a wedge issue.\nHe says Sunak is trying to force Keir Starmer to either stand up for the right to protest, or to defend the crackdown being planned by the government.\nThe next election will be about Muslims, he claims, and about the taking away of civil liberties in this country.\n\n\n\n 3.19pm GMT \n\nGalloway is now taking questions.\nHe says his first speech will be about Gaza. He says genocide is taking place there. He says journalists do not accept that. But if he had been standing for election in 1940 and 1941, he would have been entitled to campaign on the Holocaust, he says.\n\n\n\n 3.15pm GMT \nGeorge Galloway says Commons has declined since he was elected in 1980s\n\nGeorge Galloway is giving a press conference now outside St Stephen’s entrance at the House of Commons.\nHe says he has served longer in the Commons that Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer put together.\nHe says staff at the Commons have been welcoming to him, even if other MPs have not. But none of them have behaved badly. \nHe says the place has declined since he was first elected in 1987. In those days there were 100 MPs in the Commons who were prominent “figures in the land”. But that is not the case now, he says.\nHe says he hopes to speak on Wednesday, either in PMQs or in the budget debate.\nHe says he has a lot to say. He says the country is at a dangerous point, perhaps similar to what it faced in 1940. But there is no Churchill figure to remedy the situation.\nThe country is facing problems like child poverty. Rochdale used to be one of the richest towns in the country. He says he wants to make it great again.\nIn particular, he wants to save the football club, he says.\nHe wants to reopen the open air market. And he wants to bring a maternity unit to the town. He says it is a town where you cannot be born, you cannot die, and you cannot be locked up.\nHe says Rochdale should have its own postcode. At the moment it has an Oldham postcade. But the letter R is available; the town should get it, he says.\n\n\n\n 2.43pm GMT \nGeorge Galloway takes seat in Commons\n\nGeorge Galloway has taken his seat in the Commons (a term used to mean that he has sworn the oath of allegiance, and as a result is entitled to take his seat – like all MPs taking their seat, he never actually sat down, and he left the chamber straight afterwards).\nHe was escorted into the Commons by Sir Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP who is father of the house, and Neale Hanvey, the leader of the Alba party (Alex Salmond’s fringe Scottish nationalist party), who were acting as his sponsors.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.05pm GMT\n\n\n 2.07pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 2.07pm GMT \nScrap plans to scan accounts of benefit claimants or risk new scandal, MPs told\n\nPlans for automated surveillance of millions of bank accounts to catch welfare cheats should be scrapped, campaigners have said, warning the approach risks a repeat of the Post Office Horizon scandal. Robert Booth has the story.\n\n Related: Scrap plans to scan accounts of benefit claimants or risk new scandal, MPs told \n\n\n\n\n 2.01pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 1.58pm GMT \n\nGeorge Osborne, the Tory former chancellor, claimed in his podcast last week that there has been “friction” between No 10 and the Treasury in the run-up to the budget. And in the Sunday Times yesterday Tim Shipman wrote:\nThere have, however, been broader tensions between Hunt and No 10. “Rishi doesn’t think Jeremy is as clever as him, and his team think Hunt isn’t imaginative enough,” a Whitehall source said. “Hunt is resentful that he doesn’t get invited to the morning meetings and that he cut £22 billion in tax last year and he got no credit, because No 10 immediately started talking up tax cuts this year.”\nHunt had privately talked up plans to make a major move to make housing more affordable, but Sunak vetoed changes to stamp duty. Now, it is understood, the budget contains no major measures to appeal to younger voters struggling to get on the housing market.\nOne official said: “Jeremy’s just a bit absent really. He isn’t really in the room for the big decisions and spends most of the time tweeting about Surrey.” Another said: “We have no strategy because 10 and 11 don’t talk: 10 talks up tax cuts and then 11 has to talk them down. Honestly, it’s a mess.”\nAt the No 10 lobby briefing, asked if Rishi Sunak thought that Jeremy Hunt was timid, or lacked imagination, the PM’s spokesperson replied:\n\nAbsolutely not. The chancellor is working very closely with the prime minister to deliver our plan for the economy and obviously the chancellor will be setting out further measures in line with that on Wednesday at the budget.\n\n\n\n\n 1.33pm GMT \n\nRussia’s leak of a conversation by German military officers involving details of British operations on the ground in Ukraine is “worrying on a number of levels”, Tobias Ellwood, the former chairman of the Commons defence committee, has said.\nDan Sabbagh and Kate Connolly have written about the leak here.\n\n Related: British soldiers ‘on the ground’ in Ukraine, says German military leak \n\nEllwood told the Today programme this morning:\n\nThis interception and the leak of military planning discussion is worrying on a number of decibel levels.\nFirstly, why the obvious, why wasn’t basic concept protocols followed? But it also revealed a tension, I think, between senior German military who want to see Taurus dispatched and the German Chancellor, who seems increasingly focused on his political survival rather than what’s best for the continent. And it’s also how this plays out in Germany.\n\nAt the No 10 lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson said investigating the leak was “a matter for Germany”, which remained “a very close Nato ally”. As PA Media reports, the spokesperson declined to comment on UK operations in Ukraine, beyond saying there was a “small number of troops” providing protection for British diplomats and training for Ukrainian forces.\n\n\n\n 1.10pm GMT \n\nThere will be one urgent question in the Commons today at 3.30pm, on the Home Office’s decision to publish 13 reports from the former independent chief inspector of borders and immigration last week on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\nAFTER 1530 TODAY:UQ - @DianaJohnsonMP - asking for a statement on the publication of 13 reports by the former Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration on 29 February, and on how the Inspectorate will now operate in the absence of a Chief Inspector or Deputy— Labour Whips (@labourwhips) March 4, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.51pm GMT \nPaul Scully says Tories heading down 'ideological cul-de-sac' as he announces he won't contest election\n\nThe former minister Paul Scully has announced he will stand down at the next election in a statement suggesting the Conservative party has “lost its way” and is heading down “an ideological cul-de-sac”.\nScully, who is MP for Sutton and Cheam and whose ministerial jobs included being minister for London, said that after nine years in parliament he did not want to stand again in a thread on X.

I fear the electorate already is!...\n\nScully has always been seen as being on the liberal wing of the Conservative party, which is why there was surprise last week when he gave an interview claiming there were were “no-go areas” in Birmingham and east London. He apologised, saying his words had been “misconstrued”.\nIn his thread today he said that he had been trying to condemn the behaviour he personally ended up being accused of (stigmatising certain groups and areas) and he said the response he attracted on social media confirmed him in his decision to stand down.\nScully’s call for the party to focus more on housing and help for renters follows the revelation last week that the government is set to water down the renters (reform) bill. \nIn his Sunday Times story about the budget yesterday, Tim Shipman said “it is understood, the budget contains no major measures to appeal to younger voters struggling to get on the housing market”.\n\nUpdated at 12.52pm GMT\n\n\n 11.57am GMT \n\nLabour will not let a generation of youngsters “go off track”, shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said in a speech this morning setting out plans to reform opportunities for the under-24s.\nShe said that along with the help that a Labour government would provide, young people “have a responsibility to take up the work or training that’s on offer”.\nAlmost 851,000 young people aged 16-24 are not in education, employment or training – an increase of 20,000 in a year.\nIn her speech Kendall said: \n\nIf you can work there’ll be no option of a life on benefits.\nNot just because the British people believe rights should go hand-in-hand with responsibilities, but because being unemployed or lacking basic qualifications when you’re young, can harm your job prospects and wages for the rest of your life and this is not good enough for our young people or for our country.\nUnlike the Tories, we will not let a generation of young people go off track before they have even begun.\n\n\n\n\n 11.53am GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nIn by-elections, it’s normal for the returning officer to read out the number of spoilt ballots. This wasn’t done at Rochdale. Do you know how many were spoiled? I would have expected there to be quite a large number, and it would be useful to know if many Labour supporters expressed their views this way, so this could be an important number. But I haven’t been able to find it anywhere.\n\nRochdale council, which organised the byelection, tells me there were 167 spoilt ballot papers last week.\nThat figure on its own its pretty meaningless. But the House of Commons library has an invaluable briefing on elections data which says at the last general election 0.36% of all ballot papers were spoilt. This figure has been going up over the past 20 years. In the Rochdale byelection spoilt ballot papes were 0.54% of the total.\n\n\n\n 11.36am GMT \nFormer Tory leader Michael Howard says 'nobody knows' if Rwanda policy will work, but there's 'good chance' it will\n\nMichael Howard, the former Conservative party leader, has said that he cannot be sure that the Rwanda policy will work, but that he thinks there is “a good chance” that it will.\nHoward sits in the House of Lords, where this afternoon peers will start voting on the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill as it starts its report stage.\nThe bill says officials and courts should consider Rwanda a safe country for deportation purposes, and the government believes that once it becomes law it will be able to send asylum seekers arriving in the UK on small boats to Rwanda, and that this will deter others from making the same journey across the Channel.\nIn an interview on the Today programme, asked if he thought the bill would stop the boats, Howard said:\n\nI think the whole purpose of the bill is to provide a deterrent. And I think it has a good chance of working.\n\nAsked how he could know that, Howard replied:\n\nNobody knows it, because it hasn’t been tried yet in this country, but there are examples from other countries …\nIn Australia a similar system has been proved to be a deterrent. That gives us some reason to believe that this too will be a deterrent. \nAfter all, France from which the people come to cross the Channel, is a perfectly safe country. And if people have the option of staying in France or going to Rwanda, it’s a fair bet that they might choose France.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.38am GMT\n\n\n 11.17am GMT \nSupport for Tories in Ipsos polling hits lowest level for more than 40 years, with Labour 27 points ahead\n\nSupport for the Conservative party is at its lowest level for more than 40 years, according to polling from Ipsos.\nAccording to its latest monthly political monitor, Labour is on 47% (down 2 points on the previous month), and the Conservatives are on 20% (down seven points).\nIpsos says this is the lowest score that Tories have had since it started this regular poll tracker in 1978.\nHere is more on the figures from the Ipsos news release.\n\nLabour 47% (-2 pts), Conservatives 20% (-7), Liberal Democrats 9% (+2), Green 8% (+1), Reform UK 8% (+4), Other 7% (+2). Making Labour’s lead 27 points, up from 22 in January. \nThe Conservatives’ share of 20% is the lowest ever recorded by Ipsos in our regular political monitor series, which has run since 1978. Previous Conservative low points were 22% under John Major in December 1994 and May 1995, 23% in July 1997, shortly after Labour’s landslide win and 23 per cent in December 2022.\nHalf (50%) of those with a voting intention say they have definitely decided who to vote for – but 45% may change their mind. There are also signs of a growing enthusiasm gap, with only 62% of Conservatives saying they certain to vote, vs 76% of Labour voters (which feeds through into the headline voting figure) – last month the gap was just 4 points.\n\nIt is often said that any poll finding that is particularly newsworthy, because it is striking and unusual, is likely to be wrong. All polls are subject to a margin of error and they are most reliable when considered alongside other polls, as a guide to trends in opinion, rather than in isolation. The Guardian’s opinion poll tracker does not show Tory support collapsing further in January or February.\nBut the Ipsos polling also suggests Labour is comfortably ahead of the Conservatives on economic policy and on leadership, the two areas seen as crucial for electoral success.\nOn policy, Ipsos says:\n\nLabour are seen as having the best policies on managing the economy by a margin of 31% to the Conservative score of 23%. In October the parties were neck and neck.\nOn taxation, Labour are seen as having the best policies over the Conservatives by a margin of 32% to 19%.\n40% think Labour have the best policies for people in work, 15% think the Conservatives have the best policies.\n43% think Labour have the best policies for public services in general, 11% think the Conservatives have the best policies. \n35% think Labour have the best policies for the level of public spending, 16% think the Conservatives have the best policies.\n29% think the Conservatives have the best policies for Britain’s businesses, 25% think Labour have the best policies. In September 2021 the Conservatives lead on this by 41% to 17%.\n30% think the Conservatives have the best policies for Britain’s financial services sector, also known as the City, 22% think Labour have the best policies.\n\nAnd on leadership Ipsos says:\n\n19% are satisfied with the job Rishi Sunak is doing as prime minister (-1 from January) and 73% say they are dissatisfied (+7). His net rating of -54 is a record low for Mr Sunak.\nKeir Starmer’s ratings have also fallen since January. 29% are satisfied with his performance as Labour leader (-1) and 55% are dissatisfied (+7). His net score of -26 is only slightly above his lowest finding of -29 in May 2021.\n\nIpsos polled just over 1,000 people between 21 and 28 February.\nGideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos, said: \n\nThe historical comparisons continue to look ominous for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives. The Ipsos political monitor series started in the late 70s and has never recorded a Conservative vote share this low – and the job satisfaction trends for the prime minister and his government since he took office are also heading downwards. \nCombined with Labour taking leads on issues of economic credibility to go with their traditional strengths in public services, this means the Conservatives face big challenges across a number of fronts if they are to turn the situation around.\n\n\n\n\n 10.32am GMT \n\nHere are some of the budget stories from today’s papers.\n\nOliver Wright and Steven Swinford in the Times say Jeremy Hunt wants to cut national insurance by 2p in the pound. They report:\n\n\nJeremy Hunt is drafting plans for up to £9 billion worth of tax rises and spending reductions in an effort to balance the books and pay for a potential 2p cut in national insurance …\nHunt is not expected to cut income tax as he focuses instead on further reductions in national insurance, which is only paid by those in work. Cutting national insurance is cheaper than income tax and will allow Hunt the flexibility for further budget announcements.\nThese will be paid for by a series of “stealth” tax rises amounting to up to £4 billion, along with potential plans to reduce government spending after the next election. They include removing tax breaks from second-home owners who rent out their properties as holiday rentals, reducing the scope of “non-dom” tax relief and extending the levy on the profits of North Sea oil and gas companies.\n\n\nGeorge Parker in the Financial Times also says Hunt wants to cut personal taxes. He says:\n\n\nThe chancellor has been looking at an “emergency package” of revenue raisers to pay for personal tax cuts, including stealing Labour’s plan to scale back the “non-dom” tax regime, securing between £2bn and £3bn a year. \nAlso on Hunt’s list of potential revenue raisers are an increase in air passenger duty for business travel, an extension of the windfall levy on oil and gas producers, a tax on vapes and abolishing the furnished holiday let regime, according to those close to the Budget process. \nHunt could raise a further £5bn to £6bn a year if he cuts public spending plans in the next parliament, a controversial idea which has led to claims from economists that he is funding tax cuts now by making “fictitious” promises about the future. \nThe chancellor is also planning to use the Budget to insist he can make the state leaner and more efficient: he has already announced plans to cut civil service numbers to their pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\nDaniel Martin, Benedict Smith and Luke Barr in the Daily Telegraph say Hunt is considering an increase in business class air fares. They say:\n\n\nAir passenger duty is split into three categories: a reduced level for economy, a standard level for business class and a higher level for private jets.\nFor those in business class, the charge is £13 for domestic flights, £26 for up to 2,000 miles, £191 for up to 5,500 miles and £200 over that.\nAltogether, it raises £3.8 billion a year, so an increase could potentially bring in hundreds of millions more.\n\n\n\n\n 10.12am GMT \n\nMore than 300 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on the day a seven-year-old girl died when a boat capsized, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nHome Office figures show 327 people made the journey in eight boats on Sunday, taking the provisional total for the year so far to 2,582. This suggests an average of around 41 people per boat.\nIt comes after the French coastguard said the girl who drowned had been trying to cross the Channel with her pregnant mother, her father and three siblings in a boat carrying 16 people.\nAnother couple, two men and six young children were also on board when the boat got into difficulty in the early hours of the morning off the French coast, the Prefet du Nord said. They were all taken to hospital in Dunkirk.\n\n\n\n\n 9.56am GMT \n\nThis chart from the New Economics Foundation shows how households in the richest quintile (20%) gain 12 times as much as households in the poorest quintile. \nThe chart shows the figures as £2bn compared to £0.2bn, but the £0.2bn has been rounded up from £160m. (See 9.33am.)\nAnd this chart from the NEF shows much much households would benefit from a 1p in the pound cut in national insurance, compared with a £60 per month increase in universal credit, by income vingtile (5%).\n\n\n\n 9.33am GMT \nRichest households will benefit 12 times more than poorest from national insurance cut, says thinktank\n\nGood morning. On Wednesday Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, will deliver the last budget before the general election. As usual, there’s an expectation management process going on, influencing a lot (but not all) of the pre-budget reporting, but the political backdrop makes it more complicated than usual. The standard approach is to play down expectations in advance, so that when an unexpected tax cut or spending announcement comes out in the last five minutes of the speech, MPs and the media are surprised and impressed, and the coverage takes off on a cloud of positivity. But with the Conservative party still about 20 points behind in the polls (the latest figures are on the Guardian’s poll tracker), No 10 and the Treasury have been talking up the propect of tax cuts for months because that is the only way of holding off a Tory party mutiny. Hunt’s scope for giveaway measures is limited, but on his own side expectations are still high and the best reporting over the weekend and today suggests that 1p in the pound cut, almost certainly to national insurance rather than income tax, is already in the bag, and that a 2p cut might be a possibility.\nThis morning the New Economics Foundation has published research saying that if Hunt does cut national insurance in this manner, the richest households will benefit 12 times more than the poorest in cash terms. This is not a surprising or controversial assessment; much the same was said when Hunt cut national insurance by 2p in the pound in the autumn statement. But it is a point that has not received much attention in the debate in recent days, partly because Labour does not want to be seen as opposing a possible tax cut that would benefit ordinary workers.\nHere is an extract from the NEF’s news release.\n\nIf the chancellor announces a 1p cut to national insurance in this week’s budget, it will benefit the richest 20% of households 12 times more than poorest 20%, with those on the highest incomes receiving an additional £424 per year compared to £34 per year for those on the lowest. \nIt means £2bn of the £4.8bn tax cut will go to the wealthiest, while the poorest will benefit by just £160 million. \nAt the same time, households in London and the south east will be the biggest winners, gaining £252 per year on average compared with a £175 annual increase for households across the North. \n\nAnd this is from Sam Tims, a senior economist at the NEF.\n\nEverywhere you look, from our schools to hospitals to high streets, our country is falling apart at the seams while millions of people struggle to get by. Yet at the same time our chancellor is pushing for tax cuts that the country does not want, and that will benefit those who already have the most. \nNot only will this reduce government income in the immediate future, but it will also worsen inequality making us all poorer and harming the country’s prospects. \n\nAs Richard Partington and Aletha Adu report, new polling from YouGov supports the claim that tax cuts are not a priority for many people.\n\n Related: Budget plans risk ‘second lost decade’ of living standards, Jeremy Hunt told \n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10.30am: Liz Kendall, the shadow work and pensions secretary, gives a speech \n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n2.30pm: George Galloway, the new MP for Rochdale, takes his seat in the Commons.\n2.30pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\nAfter 3.20pm: Peers begin the report stage of the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "I totally agree with Caroline Lucas’s condemnation of Rishi Sunak’s nauseating speech on Friday (‘I’m still reeling from Rishi Sunak’s shameless, dangerous speech’, 3 March). Sunak’s hypocrisy was breathtaking, even by this government’s low standards. No one has done more to promote division and intolerance than the Conservatives, or to demonise and insult those they dislike or disagree with. Since 2010, we have seen the Home Office hire a fleet of vans telling immigrants to “go home”, heard the unemployed described as skivers not strivers, homelessness described as “a lifestyle choice”, opponents of Brexit portrayed as unpatriotic or ridiculed as “remoaners”, rightwing vigilantes vandalising Ulez cameras in London defended, and senior Conservatives recently insulting the Muslim (Labour) mayor of London. Meanwhile, young people are routinely derided as snowflakes, while anyone who believes in social justice or basic human decency is sneered at for being woke. All of this while ministers, claiming to be defenders of free speech against cancel culture, introduce voter ID laws (calculating that citizens who are less likely to vote Conservative will also be less likely to have official ID), curb the rights to protest and strike, try to bully the BBC into becoming a government mouthpiece and regularly demand the scrapping of human rights legislation. If Sunak is worried about threats to democracy posed by intolerance, extremism and mob rule, he and his senior colleagues should collectively look in the mirror.Pete DoreyBath • I felt a tingle of excitement when Rishi Sunak’s impromptu press conference was announced (Extremists trying to tear us apart, says Rishi Sunak in impromptu No 10 speech, 1 March). I thought that someone in No 10 had a sense of history, and wanted to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the “Who governs Britain?” election, as a prelude to an announcement that we would get a chance to answer that same question next month. But I soon realised that I was as deluded as cabinet members seem to be about the state we’re in. It’s a bit late for Sunak to start hand-wringing, either as a response to democracy having thrown up a result that he doesn’t like or as faux concern at the tone of modern political discourse. We are not experiencing “mob rule”, but those with power have provoked and stoked anger, disillusionment and disengagement. Unlawfully suspending parliament, and then briefing against members of the judiciary as “enemies of the people” when they delivered their verdict, have been a more serious assault on democracy than the chanting of any slogans.Les BrightExeter • I’m concerned at the use of the word “insurgent” to describe two individuals who have stood in a byelection to be democratically elected as a member of parliament (Report, 1 March). While George Galloway’s views may not be to everyone’s taste, his and David Tully’s success in Rochdale reflects a dissatisfaction with the government and opposition rather than the violence and struggle that this word implies. On the day that the front page read “Democracy is at threat from ‘extremists’, claims Sunak”, we needed the Guardian to tread a less inflammatory line.Matthew ClarkHadlow, Kent • Marina Hyde’s article explains why many voters such as myself will vote in the coming election out of a sense of duty, not enthusiasm (Look at the political hellscape of Sunak, Anderson, even Starmer and ask: are they making my life any better?, 27 February). There seems to be no depth to which these politicians won’t dogo to get down with the people. Even the opposition hesitates to call out such behaviour, for fear of alienating “key voters”. What it reveals is the contempt with which politicians view the electorate. Do they really think “red wall” voters are will enthused more by appeals to misogyny and Islamophobia, that than by fixing their broken schools and hospitals? Research shows that low-income voters in multi-ethnic areas are more relaxed about having Muslim neighbours than those of the higher income groups, who are less likely to mix socially with other ethnic groups. Is the truth of the matter that it is the latter group to whom Lee Anderson appeals. As for misogyny, is it not a case of Tory MPs thinking that most low-income male voters have the same misogynistic attitudes they hold. I suspect that any survey of male Tory MPs would demonstrate a higher levels of Islamophobia, sexism and misogyny thatthan is current in the nation as a whole. The sad truth is that most of us have little in common with these Tory MPs.Derrick JoadLeeds • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Under a Labour government there would be “no option of a life on benefits”, the party has said, as it set out plans to reduce the number of young people not in work, education or training. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, said the party would recruit 8,500 more mental health workers and promised that the sickness benefits bill would fall under Labour. Kendall did not specify what form the tougher measures on universal credit would take. “Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits,” she said in a speech to the centre-left Demos thinktank in London, where she sought to outline Labour’s commitment on “investing” in young people. “Not just because the British people believe rights should go hand in hand with responsibilities. But because being unemployed or lacking basic qualifications when you’re young can harm your job prospects and wages for the rest of your life.” The tough language on welfare – reminiscent of 90s-era New Labour – prompted concern about the implications of sanctions for those struggling with mental health issues.  Kendall also spoke of overhauling jobcentres to end a “tick-box culture” and devolving employment support to local areas “because the man – or even woman – in Whitehall can never know what’s best for Leicester, Liverpool and Leeds”.  She took aim at what she described as “Tory claims about being tough on benefits”, and said that over the next five years there would be 600,000 more people on incapacity and disability benefits, costing an extra £33bn. Kendall made the speech as new figures revealed that almost 851,000 young people aged 16-24 were not in education, employment or training (Neet) – an increase of 20,000 in a year. It was largely driven by the increase in young men who are Neet. Kendall was challenged in a question-and-answer session by Ollie Steadman, a policy and campaigns manager at the charity Mind, who prefaced his comments by welcoming her emphasis on the need for “quality” work. But he added: “Many of the same people might feel a bit concerned about the talk around responsibility, and potentially for it to lead to sanctions and a kind of wider system or harsher system that doesn’t get mental health.” Steadman said afterwards: “Supporting disabled people to find long-term, fulfilling work can only be achieved by taking a supportive approach. Punitive action does not work and only pushes disabled people further into poverty. Whoever forms the next UK government should restore trust in the benefits system by establishing a commission led by disabled people to redesign benefits assessments.” Kendall responded to his question by saying there was clear evidence that having a good job was very good for mental health, adding: “We know that if you’re in good work, your relapses can be cut by a third or even half. That’s better for you. It’s better for the NHS, it’s better for taxpayers.” Other concerns were expressed by Dr Michael Orton, of the Institute for Employment Research at the University of Warwick, who welcomed much of what Kendall had outlined, in particular around devolving employment support.  “But there are questions as to how this differs from programmes going back to the 1980s and which the evidence shows have marginal impact at best,” he said. “Some critical issues weren’t mentioned including fluctuating health conditions, which standard jobs can’t accommodate, and the need to update our social security system to meet new challenges not repeat punitive approaches which do more harm than good.” Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, welcomed Kendall’s plans to help tear down obstacles that prevent people from getting into and staying in employment, but he added: “We also need reform of an overly punitive benefits system which too often has harmed the very people it was set up to help.”"

        "content": "Foster families and social workers are demanding an independent inquiry after it emerged that Home Office-employed staff forced refugee children to play a game to guess who would be the next one to be placed in foster care. In a letter published today in the Guardian, the British Association of Social Workers, the Fostering Network, the Refugee Council and Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (ECPAT) are among 20 bodies saying that children are being failed, abused and exploited because of the current Home Office system. The letter says: “In our work with refugee children, we repeatedly see how they are being failed. Hundreds of unaccompanied children missing from hotels still have not been found. Children systematically wrongly age-assessed are treated as adults and placed in the same bedrooms as unrelated adult strangers. There is a culture of callous disregard for children’s basic right to dignity. “It is time for the government to carry out a wide-ranging independent inquiry into the treatment of unaccompanied children who come to our country seeking safety.” The Home Office launched an internal inquiry after the “game” was disclosed on Thursday by a report on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children written by David Neal, the sacked borders watchdog. An inspector working for Neal at one of four hotels where dozens of children were living was shocked to hear that they were gathered together when one of their number was to be placed with a foster family. “One team leader described the process by which they would disclose to the children who would be the next to leave for a placement,” the report said. “This involved ‘making a game of it’, asking them to guess who would be next, before revealing their name. Inspectors considered this to be insensitive in the extreme and undoubtedly upsetting to the children.” In the reinspection of four hotels where children were being housed, the borders inspector found there was no guarantee that staff had been given regular disclosure and barring services clearances. In evidence to the reinspection, the Home Office reported that 147 children had left the hotels without supervision and remained unaccounted for between July 2021 and 8 September 2023. Neal was sacked last month as independent inspector of borders and immigration after disclosing details of some of 15 reports that he had submitted up to 11 months ago. Thirteen of the reports, totalling 900 pages, were released by the Home Office on Thursday – the same day as the Sarah Everard report, immigration statistics and a hard-hitting NAO report revealing the cost of the Rwanda scheme. The Home Office was accused by Labour of attempting to bury bad news. Neal has accused Rishi Sunak of breaking his pledge to deliver reforms of the Home Office and Border Force. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The safety and welfare of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children is our utmost priority. After the inspections findings, we launched a full investigation into the inappropriate behaviour of the support worker, who was removed from site immediately and did not return. “Since the two Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration inspections in 2022 and 2023, we have closed all seven hotels used to accommodate unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.”"

        "published_date": "2024-03-03T17:08:51+00:00",
        "content": "The former Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who has died aged 80, was one of the last miners in Britain to be elected to the House of Commons. He took his seat as the MP for Blyth Valley following the 1987 election, two years after the collapse of the miners’ strike and a year after the closure of Bates colliery, in Blyth, where Campbell had worked underground since 1958.  Before his election to Westminster, where he stayed in office until he stood down in 2019, Campbell had spent more than two decades as an elected officer of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). He was among the original flying pickets in the 1984-85 miners’ dispute and was arrested twice during the bitter confrontations of the divisive strike.  He had also spent 18 years as a local councillor, and at Westminster he spoke with the authentic voice of his community, regarding his lifelong dedication to fighting for employment and for the future of the Blyth Valley as a simple matter of duty, while his uncompromising political career was defined by his belief in a representative democracy. A socialist and member of the leftwing Campaign group of MPs, he happily espoused any cause that might advance the interests of his constituency, thus winning a reputation as a rebellious member of the “awkward squad”. He was a popular man, forgiven much for his gusty sense of humour, who was always guided by his principles and his Roman Catholic faith; he repeatedly refused to support any moves to relax abortion law.  He was as prepared to vote, in 2017, against the party line on Brexit – as laid down by Jeremy Corbyn, whom he had nominated as leader – as he had consistently opposed the Iraq war under Tony Blair. At one point in his 32 years in Westminster he was named by the whips as the second most rebellious MP in the Commons, and he also topped a “plain-speaking” poll by TheyWorkForYou.com in 2015 as the MP who spoke with the greatest simplicity and ease of understanding. A month after his first election he voted against a pay increase of 21.9% for MPs and announced that he would take home a miner’s weekly pay of £210 and donate the rest to his constituency party.  The money was used to finance an office to deal with what was at the time 5,000 annual queries. When he retired at the 2019 election, Campbell spoke of his pride at the fact that he had secured an enterprise zone status for the Blyth estuary, won funding for new school buildings and for dealing with the problems of drug abuse in the area, but said: “The big one was just being there to help people.” In 1998 he was ordered out of the Commons’ chamber for refusing to withdraw after calling a Conservative “a hypocrite”. When Margaret Thatcher died in 2013 and MPs were recalled over Easter to pay tribute to the former prime minister, he declined to attend on the grounds that it would be hypocritical of him to do so, given his unremitting criticism of her role in the closure of the coal industry. He was embarrassed, however, following the revelations of the MPs’ expenses scandal that emerged in 2009, when he agreed to return £6,200 of £87,729 he had claimed for furnishing his second home in London, saying that taxpayers’ money should not have been used for furniture. “We were miles out of order,” he said. Born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, now Tyne and Wear, Ronnie was one of eight children of Edna (nee Howes) and Ronald Campbell, a joiner. In 2005 he was reunited with a half-sibling born to his mother, the prison reformist Eric McGraw, who had been adopted as an infant. Ronnie attended a state primary school and Blyth Ridley high school, leaving aged 14 and signing on at Bates colliery after his 15th birthday.  He was elected to the NUM branch committee in 1965 and joined the Labour party in 1967. Two years later he stood for election to Blyth borough council, of which he was a member for five years. From 1974 until 1988 he was a Blyth Valley councillor, chairing the environmental health committee and vice-chair of the housing committee. In 1986, when Bates pit closed down, Campbell signed on for the dole and planned to become a care worker. The NUM agreed to sponsor him as a parliamentary candidate and he unsuccessfully sought selection for nearby Berwick. Meanwhile the former Labour MP for Blyth Valley, John Ryman, had fallen out with his constituency party, resigned from Labour and announced he would not stand at the next election. Campbell won the selection to replace him by a single vote. At Westminster he became a member of the select committee for the office of the ombudsman in 1987 and subsequently of the public administration committee (1997-2001) and of the health and social care committee (2005-2007). He announced his retirement at the next election in the summer of 2019 and stood down in December when his seat fell to the Conservative candidate, Ian Levy. In 1967 Campbell married Deirdre McHale, a county councillor. She survives him, as do their children, Edward, Sharon, Barry, Shaun, Brendan and Aidan.  • Ronald Campbell, miner and politician, born 14 August 1943; died 23 February 2024"

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt has been forced to contribute more than £100,000 of his own money to his constituency Conservative party to bolster his chances of re-election, official records show, amid warnings that he is set to lose his seat. Hunt’s Godalming and Ash constituency is a target seat for the Liberal Democrats, and a Survation poll projects that he is on course to become the first chancellor in modern times to lose at a general election. Electoral Commission records show that he has given £105,261 to the South-west Surrey Conservative association over the last five years. The chancellor’s personal donations to the association under the last three Conservative prime ministers stand in stark contrast to the total £4,447 he gifted under the leadership of Theresa May and David Cameron. The most recent accounts for Hunt’s local association have warned that its “balance sheet is at a less than satisfactory level”. A note stated that members’ annual subscriptions were due to increase this year. Donations to the chancellor’s association were down by almost 50% in 2021. South West Surrey received only £42,693 in donationsthat year, down from over £80,000 in 2020. A Labour source said: “This tells you everything you need to know about the state of the Conservative party, with the chancellor seemingly spending more time dishing out personal cheques to prolong his political career than fixing the economy his government has wrecked. “And on the same day the chancellor is talking about clamping down on money being wasted, he might want to look at how he is spending some of his own money.”   Related: Jeremy Hunt’s seat under threat as voters put NHS ahead of tax perks   Hunt said on Sunday: “I hope to be chancellor after the election.” However, the poll in his constituency shows the Lib Dems on 35% of the vote, the Tories on 29% and Labour on 22%. When local voters were asked to outline the issues that would determine how they would vote, health and the NHS was top, while only 4% said tax was a key issue. Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “It’s no wonder that Jeremy Hunt is on the brink of his losing his seat when people across Surrey are furious they can’t get GP appointments, that their hospitals have been left to crumble, and water firms are still allowed to pollute their rivers. “In the chancellor’s own back yard, food bank demand is surging after his government failed to get a grip on the cost of living crisis. Liberal Democrats are fired up in Surrey to oust Conservative MPs who have taken people for granted.”"

        "content": "A future Labour government would reduce the number of foreign countries that receive development aid, Lisa Nandy has said, arguing money should go to the poorest states, not middle-income ones. The shadow international development secretary told a meeting of diplomats and NGOs at the ODI thinktank (formerly the Overseas Development Institute) this week that there should be a shift in the focus of aid and that Labour would take “a more strategic approach based on Britain’s unique strengths”. Nandy, who has been consulting a range of former development aid ministers, said the current minister, Andrew Mitchell, had told her UK aid was being sent to 33 countries when Labour left office in 2010. “We’re now working in 88, with just a fraction of the budget,” she said. Nandy stressed a Labour government would “never pull out the rug from under countries who rely on us. “But this is not 1997. Our economy is not twice the size of China’s, and the world’s debt is no longer primarily owed to countries like ours.” Nandy’s comments come amid debate in her party about how it should approach foreign aid. There are those who want Labour to rapidly return to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid, but she reiterated that in government the party would only return to the target – ditched under Boris Johnson’s premiership – when circumstances allowed. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is understood to be engaged in the discussions, with a view to getting value for money from Britain’s aid spend. “But the immediate task will be to ensure that our development budget is spent on development and not raided constantly by badly managed departments across Whitehall,” Nandy said, referring to its use by the Home Office on refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. “It’s poor value for money. It’s depleting badly needed resources, and it undermines our reputation in every corner of the globe as a long-term reliable partner.” Nandy said Labour was looking at whether the British government could provide guarantees to developing countries risking unmanageable debt burdens, and back a push for an international definition of unsustainable debt.  “The UK is home to the City of London and the legal jurisdiction where many of these debts are settled. These countries need us, and we owe it to them to help,” she said. Labour is likely to come under particular pressure from NGOs, including Save the Children and Oxfam, to restore the aid budget back to 0.7% of national income. Charities were among those who last year described UK aid cuts as a “death sentence” for children in the world’s most dangerous places."

        "published_date": "2024-03-03T14:00:01+00:00",
        "content": "Less than a fifth of the projects approved by Michael Gove to improve towns across England have been completed, the government has admitted, in the latest sign of the problems facing his levelling up agenda. Responses from Gove’s department to freedom of information requests show that fewer than 20% of the projects sanctioned under the £3.6bn towns fund were on track to be finished by the end of February. Fewer than half will have been completed by the next election, even if it is held in November, the figures show. The data is the latest example of how difficult the Conservatives have found it to meet the promises the party made at the last election to use post-Brexit freedoms to reduce regional inequality in England. The Guardian revealed last year that councils were having to scale back or freeze levelling up projects because of soaring costs and that Gove’s department was handing back nearly £2bn of housing money after struggling to find projects to spend it on. Jack Shaw, a local government expert who uncovered the figures, said: “Given this was a flagship policy priority at the last general election, the expectations on the government to deliver new infrastructure in places that have historically been ignored were high. “Inflation and interest rates have prevented some projects from making progress, but the government has also failed to respond to those changes and has instead asked places to reduce their ambition. Come the election, current evidence suggests the government will have failed its pledge to ‘level up’ communities.” The towns fund was announced immediately after the last election, with Gove promising it would give “underinvested towns the much-needed funding and support to get going on their long-term plans”. The fund was a key plank in his levelling up plan to improve infrastructure outside London and major cities. Projects include a new investment zone around Blackpool airport, an industrial centre in Grimsby and the regeneration of Bedford’s train station. Since then, however, high inflation has eaten into large parts of Gove’s budget and made it increasingly difficult to complete building projects. The Guardian reported last year that at least £500m had been lost from levelling up projects because of rising costs, with leisure buildings, high streets, museums and public spaces all being hit. Many councils have stalled or reduced their plans as a result of higher costs, and some say they have found it a lengthy and bureaucratic process to get Whitehall officials to approve their alterations to the original plans. A report by Thurrock council last November showed the authority struggling under the pressures of higher inflation. The council was due to spend £22.8m on improving Tilbury town centre, including a new community hub, a youth centre, new cycle paths and a new jetty. In November local officials warned there had been “significant cost price inflation” since the plans were submitted, forcing them to review the entire scheme to make sure the council did not overspend. The report added: “There has been a significant delay in the confirmation of the business cases due to the need for further reassurance and assessment work on governance by [the levelling up department] and the commissioners.” The figures unearthed by Shaw show that out of 973 towns fund projects, only 154 are due to have been completed by the end of February. By the end of November, that figure rises to 385, just 40% of the total. More than 170 projects are due to finish in March 2026, the official deadline given by Gove for spending all the towns fund money. A few are scheduled for completion after that date, but officials indicated this could be because they were relying on other sources of funding to finish the projects. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “All of the money which was allocated from the towns fund is on track to be spent by March 2026 as planned, with more than 100 projects already completed. The rate at which projects are being completed is entirely consistent with the delivery timeframes we have set out.” Labour said the problems were a further indication of the issues with ministers in Westminster trying to dictate how local authorities across the country spend their money. Justin Madders, the shadow levelling up minister, said: “The Tories’ begging-bowl approach to levelling up forces leaders to spend time, effort and taxpayers’ money bidding for uncertain and tightly ringfenced pots of money. This sticking-plaster approach won’t give local leaders the tools they need to drive growth in their local area and live up to their best potential.” • The headline of this article was amended on 5 March 2024. An earlier version said that less than 20% of “levelling up projects” have been completed; in fact, as the article itself explains, it is 20% of projects under the towns fund, which is a subset of the overall levelling up budget."

        "content": "George Galloway’s victory in the Rochdale byelection has been greeted with a shrug of complacency by most commentators. After all, Galloway has a habit of pulling off shock byelection wins only to disappear quickly afterwards, and his success this time owed much to happenstance. Perhaps if Labour had not been forced to suspend its candidate after he was recorded at a public meeting claiming that Israel had planned the 7 October attacks, Galloway would not have won. Perhaps the whole episode tells us little about the outcome of the forthcoming general election, let alone the future of British politics. Then again, perhaps not. Things would be more straightforward if we could take Galloway, and the Workers’ Party of Britain (WPB) that he leads, at face value. They claim to be a leftwing outfit that won Rochdale on a surge of pro-Palestinian sentiment in the wake of Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza. But the truth is murkier. During this campaign, Galloway’s team sent out more than one set of correspondence. One, addressed to Muslims in the constituency, urged voters to “use your vote to send Keir Starmer and the Labour party a message – stop supporting genocide, stop supporting Israeli aggression, and stand with Palestine”. His other election address, targeting a different demographic, tells another story. It trumpets Galloway’s record of backing Brexit, opposing Scottish independence and supporting family values. A whole paragraph is dedicated to outlining his opposition to transgender rights and his conviction that “God creates everything in pairs”. “I believe in law and order,” the letter reads. “There will be no grooming gangs in Rochdale. Even if I have to arrest them myself.” It ends with a deliberate nod to Donald Trump, promising to “make Rochdale great again”. Alienated white voters were a key part of Galloway’s winning coalition. The WPB is as much about social conservatism as it is about leftwing economic policies. It promises decent housing, better-funded public services and workers’ rights. But it also promises to combat the “ridiculous intersectional ideology of radical liberals”, and to put a stop to net zero. Perhaps this is why Nick Griffin, Britain’s most famous far-right leader, called for a vote for Galloway in Rochdale, saying Galloway “understands the position of working-class white Britons on immigration”. Chris Williamson, a former Labour MP and now the WPB’s deputy leader, was asked on the BBC’s Today programme if he would like to distance the party from Griffin’s endorsement. He declined to do so. Galloway’s political shift can be measured in organisational terms. When he was expelled from the Labour party in 2003, he joined Respect, a broad leftwing party that emerged from the movement against the Iraq war. Galloway last stood for Respect in 2015, when he lost Bradford West to Labour. By 2020, he had shifted gear entirely, founding All for Unity, an unsuccessful attempt to bring together Scottish unionists, including Tory and Ukip figures, before the 2021 Scottish parliament elections. Now, Galloway leads the WPB, which campaigns, in its words, “for the workers not the wokers”. Whereas Respect often relied on the activist work ethic of the Socialist Workers’ Party (SWP), the WPB was until recently backed by the Communist party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist), an explicitly Stalinist organisation. The authoritarian, socially conservative group made excellent bag-carriers for Galloway’s long march away from the left.   Related: ‘They don’t represent us’: Rochdale voters on why they deserted major parties   Across Europe, figures are toying with the same strategy. Sahra Wagenknecht was until recently a prominent spokesperson for Germany’s Left party. She split last year to found her own project and is now polling at about 7% before May’s European elections. Like Galloway, she espouses an explicitly conservative agenda on culture war issues and opposes environmentalism. She has long called for a rolling back of Germany’s acceptance of refugees, once warning that “there should be no neighbourhoods where natives are in a minority”. Like Galloway, she was critical of Covid lockdowns, playing to an audience otherwise courted by the far right. And, like Galloway, Wagenknecht has spoken about Putin’s right to push back against “Nato aggression”. There are plenty of caveats to Galloway’s success in Rochdale. The demographic coalition he is trying to unite – Muslim voters angry about Gaza and socially conservative white working-class voters – are not obvious bedfellows. It is more than possible that Labour will regain the seat at the general election. But politics is about more than election results, and after a decade of upsets it is unwise for anyone to write off what Galloway represents. Received wisdom has him down as a fringe left figure whose moment in the sun will pass. The opposite is the case: Galloway is no longer bound by the left, and freed from it he is dangerous. • Michael Chessum is a freelance writer and socialist activist  Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "Leading economists warn today that Jeremy Hunt will “cost the country dear” if he gambles on pre-election cuts to tax and spending in this week’s budget. Two former advisers to the Treasury, backed by other economists, said that instead of decisions aimed at “sabotaging prospects for the next government”, the chancellor should focus on the long-term national interest with measures to spur investment and growth.   Related: The budget: what Jeremy Hunt needs to do – and the pitfalls he must avoid   In a statement to the Observer, Dimitri Zenghelis, a former head of economic forecasting at the Treasury, and Anna Valero, a former member of the chancellor’s economic advisory council, said the country needed to break out of a cycle of short-termism. “Tax cuts to stimulate a pre-­election consumer spending spree is the last thing the British economy needs and will cost us all dear,” they said. “For over a decade, economic short-termism and low and volatile investment has saddled the country with macroeconomic instability, stagnant living standards and one of the poorest productivity performances among major economies.” Warning against using the budget for political reasons and to satisfy demands from Tory MPs to slash spending and cut tax, they added: “Instead of sabotaging prospects for the next government, the chancellor should announce a package of measures to drive UK innovation and competitiveness, spur productivity and unlock new, intelligent and sustainable forms of growth.” On Saturday there were signs of tension between No 10 and the Treasury over tax and spend decisions, with Rishi Sunak said to be pushing harder for tax reductions. Government sources said a move to reduce a planned rise in public spending for 2025 from 0.9% of GDP to 0.75% (which would raise £5bn) was “still live”, as was the ­prospect of more tax cuts. A further reduction in national insurance, in addition to the 2% announced last autumn, or in the basic rate of income tax have both been under consideration. Another option being considered is scaling back the benefits “non-doms” receive from the tax system. Such a move – which the Tory government has previously claimed would drive wealth out of the country – would be seen as nakedly political because Labour has promised to use the £2bn it would raise from scrapping non-dom tax status to fund its flagship policy of breakfast clubs in all state primary schools, as well as more dental appointments. Labour sources have indicated that if the government does scale back tax breaks for non-doms, Keir Starmer’s party may not be able to fulfil its policy commitments should it come to power. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility informed the Treasury that the amount of “fiscal headroom” it has – around £13bn to fund any giveaways – had fallen over recent days due to the state of the national finances, lessening Hunt’s room for manoeuvre.   Related: Toxic budgets: the UK chancellors who left a poisonous legacy   Of that £13bn, around £5bn is expected to be accounted for by freezing fuel duty again while a further 1% cut in national insurance would cost another £4.5bn. Ben Zaranko, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the chancellor was “sailing very close to the wind” if he was to meet his rule of having debt falling as a proportion of GDP within five years. “If the government was serious about getting debt falling, it would aim to meet this target with a greater degree of ‘headroom’ rather than seek to spend every last penny,” he said. “The chancellor faces a clear temptation to ‘pay for’ immediate tax cuts with unspecified post-election cuts to public services, thereby leaving the difficult business of allocating those spending cuts to the next government. He should resist that temptation. If he wants to cut taxes, he should spell out where the spending cuts will fall.” David Gauke, a former Tory Treasury minister, said: “If they are going to bet the house on lower taxes, that will make them look less fiscally credible. That is a political risk as well as being an economic risk. “They may think they are just passing on problems to a future government but it will also damage the Conservatives’ wider economic reputation if they go down that route.” Gauke added that Hunt’s reputation was at stake. “This is probably his last big job and his last budget. If I was Jeremy Hunt my priority would be ensuring that my reputation and the Conservatives’ reputation for good economic management is enhanced not diminished, rather than trying to gamble that a big tax cut would be transformational, which I don’t think it would be. It certainly wasn’t last autumn.” On Saturday as budget talks continued between No 10 and 11 Downing Street, the Treasury announced £800m of investment by 2029 in a series of measures across the police, NHS and justice system to improve productivity in the public sector. To help get police officers back to frontline tasks, over £230m will fund the rollout of time-saving technology including automated redaction of personal information such as name badges in shoplifting incidents, irrelevant faces from body-worn cameras and number plates from video evidence. Hunt said: “We shouldn’t fall into the trap of thinking more spending buys us better public services. There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we’re sick.” Zenghelis, now at Cambridge University, and Valero, from the London School of Economics, blamed what they described as Hunt’s “arbitrary debt rules” for “stunting UK growth”. They said that higher borrowing would be more than justified so long as the money was spent on vital infrastructure that would boost growth. Hunt is expected to tell parliament on Wednesday that he has constructed a budget that will bring down the ratio of debt to annual national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), in the final year of his five-year forecast. Under the terms of the rule, the debt to GDP ratio is allowed to rise for four years, as long as it falls in the fifth year of projections for the economy and the public finances provided by the Office for Budget Responsibility – the Treasury’s independent forecasting unit. UK GDP is about £2.1tn and the cumulative debt position is about the same, leaving a debt to GDP ratio of about 96%. Zenghelis and Valero said: “The time has come to reform the fiscal rules and banish the myth of fiscal headroom. Debt is not a burden if it finances resilient, sustainable and productive investment. “The stop-start nature of the UK’s investment means there are significant underspends from year to year and lots of money is wasted. This is a contributing factor to falling living standards.”"

        "content": "Sadiq Khan has condemned Rishi Sunak for failing to call out “racist, anti-Muslim and Islamophobic” remarks by a senior Tory MP, following the prime minister’s Downing Street address in which he criticised political extremists. In a blunt response to Sunak’s unusual intervention, the London mayor said the prime minister had still not fully addressed the nature of the remarks made by former Tory vice-chair Lee Anderson, who said Islamists had “got control” of Khan and London. Khan, one of the most powerful Muslims in public life, warned that the past few weeks had seen “a concerted and growing attempt by some to degrade and humiliate minorities for political and electoral gain”. This follows another fractious week, in which George Galloway won the Rochdale byelection after a bitter contest. Following the result, the prime minister made an impromptu speech on Friday night stating that democracy was under attack and criticising voters for backing Galloway – whose pitch was focused on Gaza and heavy criticism of Israel. However, Khan said Sunak and his team had still not fully addressed the remarks made by Anderson last month. While the Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party, ministers have refused to say the remarks amounted to Islamophobia. “We are a week on from the racist, anti-Muslim and Islamophobic remarks made by a senior Tory MP,” Khan told a London Labour conference last night. “The prime minister has failed to condemn them for what they are – even as he stood outside No 10 and spoke out against extremism – and neither has anybody around him. “What we are witnessing is a concerted and growing attempt by some to degrade and humiliate minorities for political and electoral gain. We have been here before – in 2016, when the Tories waged a disgraceful campaign against me, against us. We cannot let them try it again.. As the poison of antisemitism and Islamophobia continues to infect our politics, now more than ever, we need to display our best values rather than our worst fears.” The Conservatives received further criticism after reports that Anderson, who has refused to apologise for his comments about Khan, appeared with former prime minister Liz Truss at a party fundraiser in Nottinghamshire on Friday. Many Tory MPs suspect Anderson is planning to defect to Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit party. Jonathan Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, said it “beggars belief” that Anderson continues to attend Tory party events. “Given that Rishi Sunak deems Mr Anderson unfit to be a Tory MP, he now needs to bar him from fundraising for the Tory party,” he said. “Unless he takes action, Rishi Sunak will again be exposed as weaker than ever, and out of control of his chaotic, divided party.”   It may be that they don’t have the votes to win seats, but as we always see, when it comes to it, people panic  Labour MP    Meanwhile, Galloway’s victory in Rochdale has caused nervousness among many Labour MPs. Some are already under local pressure to strengthen their criticism of Israel. While many see Galloway as a unique character with a track record of by-election victories, some believe a coalition of Muslim and leftwing voters concerned about Labour’s stance on Gaza could cost the party seats. A slate of independent candidates to run against those Labour MPs who failed to back a Gaza ceasefire in a vote last year is being drawn up, with the first tranche of names set to be announced soon. While few of those who stand will have a chance of winning a seat, some Labour MPs are concerned that Keir Starmer’s team are underestimating the threat posed by such candidates, because they could take Labour votes and let in the Tories in tight contests. There are also concerns about their impact on party management. “It may be that they don’t have the votes to win seats, but ... when it comes to it, people panic,” said one Labour MP. The row comes as Khan is warning that his chances of claiming another term as London mayor have been exaggerated by polls suggesting he has a significant lead over Susan Hall, the Tory candidate. His team believes the impact of the switch to a first-past-the-post system, as well as changes to voter ID that they believe will suppress the Labour vote, will effectively erase the 5% winning margin Khan enjoyed at his last election. He said last night that he was in what he believed was the toughest contest of his political life. “With no second preferences, the choice is between me and the most divisive, hard-right candidate the Tories have ever put up in London,” he said."

        "content": "Michael Gove has accused the Scottish National party government of running down Scotland because of its “devastating” obsession with independence, as he tried to rally Conservative activists in Aberdeen. Gove, an Aberdonian who is now the most prominent Scot in the UK government, said Scotland’s institutions had been neglected by the SNP because it had focused so heavily on the constitution at the expense of public services. “We have to look at their record, their stewardship of the essential elements of Scottish civic and public life. And it is a devastatingly depressing story,” he told delegates at a Scottish Conservative party fringe meeting. “Every single one of the institutions that makes Scotland great and makes us proud to be Scots has been run down under the SNP Scottish government and it’s been run down because of their relentless unilateral focus on division, separatism and re-asking a constitutional question which was supposed to have been settled for a generation in 2014.” His speech, which delighted delegates, came as fresh polling evidence emerged about the significant electoral challenge the Scottish Tories face at the general election when they defend seven Westminster seats. The latest poll for the Scottish Electoral Study found that 58% of former Tory voters in Scotland now expected to vote for other parties, with a significant number switching to Labour. In October 2023, the same study put that defection rate at 42%. Last week, a Survation poll found Scottish Tory support in a Westminster vote had slumped to 15%, nearly half the support for the Conservatives in early 2020. Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, said the Scottish Tories needed to focus on the UK government’s record of investing in Scotland in the runup to the election. It had spent several hundred million pounds through the levelling-up fund in towns such as Dumfries, Elgin and Aberdeen, which had been “overlooked and undervalued” by the SNP. The nationalists, he said, frequently focused on ill-considered policies designed to divide the UK, such as on a botched bottle-and-can return scheme, on a gender recognition bill thrown out by the courts and on refusing initially to follow England and Wales by banning XL bully dogs, before reversing that decision. Gove said: “We believe in partnership, we believe that we are better together, we believe in a better future for everyone in Scotland and the United Kingdom. “And that was the contrast between us and the Scottish government. We believe in the power of the union. They believe in separation, division and denigration.”   Related: Anderson and Braverman shout loudest, but one man has led the toxification of the Tories: Michael Gove | Andy Beckett   The Scottish Election Study’s data shows Tory switchers are deserting the party because they are angry about the UK government’s performance and competence at Westminster, a theme one MSP said was being picked up by frustrated Tory canvassers. Critics of the Tories point to cuts in social security benefits fuelling an increase in poverty and the cost of living crisis, and argue that Scotland was entitled to stage a second independence referendum because the Brexit vote dramatically changed the case for remaining in the UK. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said there was, however, strong evidence the Conservative vote was holding up in its core areas. It had won two recent council byelections, in Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, and in Jedburgh, with substantial increases in vote share. Ross believes the Scottish Tories can capitalise on rising discontent with the SNP government in Edinburgh by making the general election a referendum on SNP competence, rather than focusing on Labour’s rise under Keir Starmer. He told delegates that disgruntled voters should use the Tories “as your vehicle to make the SNP pay for years of distraction and neglect”."

        "content": "Ministers should hand all 30-year-olds a £10,000 “citizens inheritance” amid fears a £1.5tn wealth transfer to millennials will deepen inequalities, a Conservative peer has urged.  David Willetts, who leads the Intergenerational Centre thinktank, called for the next government to implement a major new policy to spread wealth in Britain. It comes as research showed parents whose assets have been boosted by soaring property prices and final salary pensions are poised to bequeath millennial children about £150,000 each on average. While annual inheritance transfers are forecast to rise by a third to £145bn by 2033, one in 10 millennials are still set to get nothing. By contrast, the top 10% will get more than £500,000 each and many much more, analysis for the Guardian by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found. A separate analysis, by the estate agent Knight Frank, this week claimed that over the next two decades, $90tn of assets – mostly driven by rising house prices – will move between the silent generation and baby boomer and millennials in the US alone. This would make affluent millennials “the richest generation in history”. The suggestion millennials were about to become rich was met by bemusement from many in the generation born between 1980 and 1994 who, while being derided by some for profligate spending on gourmet coffee and avocado on toast, have lived through slow wage growth, rising rents and the evaporation of dreams of home ownership. The huge sums being inherited by a new generation could, nevertheless, result in a shift in the way money is invested, with research showing millennials are happier to hold cryptocurrency and assets that can show societal and environmental benefits.  Interactive  Millennials are certainly set to benefit from having fewer siblings with whom to share windfalls than their parents – 1.8 compared with 2.5 for people born in the 60s. But most should not get excited about retiring early. The IFS said the typical age at which they will inherit is 64 – an age at which the Beatlessaid was apt for renting a cottage in the Isle of Wight and sitting grandchildren on your knee. “It doesn’t matter if you are Conservative or Labour, a world in which inheritance matters more and earnings matter less is a less open and socially mobile society,” Willetts said. “[Inheritances are now] coming to people quite late in life. It will reinforce a pattern of inheritance where the grandkids will benefit. We are going to have some very rich inheritors and a growing number of people who never get on the housing ladder and rent until old age.” Without reform, a key consequence of the way inheritances will be transferred is set to be widening inequality. Inheritances will only nudge up lifetime incomes by 5% for millennials from the poorest fifth of families while those from the richest fifth will enjoy a 29% wealth bump, the IFS said. That will probably mean the inheritance surge will also deepen wealth differences between people in the north and south, where property values have grown at vastly different rates. For example, millennial friends who studied together at university and enjoyed similar economic circumstances through the bulk of their careers could see their fortunes diverge markedly when they inherit, placing tensions on social bonds. If their parent owned a home in London, they would have made £254,000 on average in house price growth over the past 15 years. But if their parent owned a home in the east of England or the north-west, that windfall would have been at most a third of that figure. Inheritance flows will probably exacerbate inequalities between white people and those from black African, black Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds who are already half to a third as likely to receive lifetime gifts from their parents, possibly owing to them being less wealthy.   Related: ‘Ruinously expensive’: record number of inheritance disputes in England and Wales   Willetts said too little had been done to spread wealth since the council house right to buy scheme and the privatisation of utilities such as British Telecom in the 1980s. He revived the idea of the citizens inheritance after first proposing it six years ago. A similar idea has also been proposed by the IPPR thinktank, which is seen as increasingly influential on the Labour party. Willetts said it could be paid for by lowering the threshold at which inheritance tax is paid – effectively £1m in many cases – abolishing exemptions while also reducing the current 40% tax rate. The amount of money gathering in inheritable assets has been growing rapidly in recent years. David Sturrock, senior research economist at the IFS, said the average household led by people in their 70s holds 20% more wealth than the same group a decade ago. “Working incomes are growing more slowly so the amounts [in inheritances] are a much more consequential part of your lifetime resources,” he said. • This article was amended on 4 March 2024 because an earlier version referred to a figure being at least “three times smaller” than £254,000. The intended reference was to a figure a third of £254,000."

        "content": "Nothing shouts “Don’t panic! Don’t panic” more than a hastily arranged speech from the prime minister outside No 10 at 5.45pm on a Friday. Still, on the plus side, those who chose to carry on watching Pointless on BBC One won’t have missed a thing. It would have been hard to tell the two apart. Rishi Sunak is the politician’s anti-politician. If he ever came close to a real politician, he might dissolve on contact. Just as well there are so few of them in his cabinet. You could almost call it a talent – the unerring ability to do the wrong thing. To strike the wrong tone. To misjudge the situation. Every time you think things couldn’t get any worse, Rish! appears to say: “Hold my Coke.” This was meant to be Sunak at his most impassioned. Bringing the country together at what he thought was a time of crisis. Whether the election of George Galloway, thanks to the stupidity of Labour, really is a crisis is open to question. Clearly it’s a lot less than desirable. But a crisis? Galloway is just one of politics’ natural gobshites. The left’s version of Nigel Farage. A man whose prime cause is himself and who exists in a narcissistic bubble of trouble-making. A little man who gets off on division. Shakespeare’s words “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing” could have been written for him. To treat him any more seriously is to indulge him. There was no real argument to Sunak’s speech. Nor was there any real rhetorical power. He is a prime minister unfortunately blessed with levitas. It’s almost impossible to take what he is saying seriously. Least of all in his speech was any policy. Sunak just wanted to spend 10 minutes sharing his innermost fears with the nation without offering any solutions. Something he might have been better off doing with his therapist. If he hasn’t got one, he should find one urgently.   The longer Sunak went on, the more desperate and the less effectual he sounded. And he was starting with a very low bar   What shone through his words was the absence. There was a hollow, a vacuum at the core of his message. Because what he was really crying out for was for someone – something – to come and take control. He wanted a government. He wanted a leader to make him feel safe. Because deep down, he knows he is not that man. As a prime minister, he is a fraud. At its most Freudian, this was Sunak’s primal scream for his daddy. Rish! approached the lectern trying to look purposeful. Though mostly just relieved that the rain had momentarily held off and he wasn’t going to get soaked. He began by describing the problem. Extremism was on the rise in the country. On the far left and on the far right.  There was an increase in antisemitism. Jewish children afraid to walk to school. And an increase in hatred against Muslims, with women abused in the streets. There were threats to MPs in parliament. And now – the final straw – there was the election of Galloway in Rochdale. Democracy was now under threat. Weirdly, it never seemed to have occurred to Sunak to ask himself why this all might be happening on his watch. Such a lack of intellectual curiosity in a man who prides himself on being clever is breathtaking. Perhaps the denial is too great. Perhaps it needs to be; otherwise he could not get through the day. Let’s do the work for him. Let’s start with Brexit. Because that’s where political discourse in the country started to become more polarised and violent. Where was Rish! when the Daily Mail and the Telegraph called judges and remainer MPs “traitors” and “enemies of the people”? Cheering the newspapers on. That’s where. Where was Rish! when Boris Johnson upended centuries of accepted parliamentary procedure with the illegal prorogation? Cheerfully nodding it through. So forgive us if we don’t take Sunak as a democratic role model. Fast forward a few years. To Rish!’s term in office. Inviting Suella Braverman to be home secretary despite her being found to have broken the ministerial code. Minutes after Sunak promised to govern with “professionalism, integrity and accountability”. Then the prolonged attacks on refugees and minorities. The othering of people who couldn’t defend themselves. Just because he imagined it would go down well with the right wing of the Tory party. He practically introduced a daily 15 minute hate. George Orwell would have been horrified. Then to the present. A former prime minister, Liz Truss, who peddles conspiracy theories about the Bank of England being infiltrated by the deep state. Sunak just smiles indulgently. As he does with Lee Anderson. Rish! may have suspended 30p Lee but the body language indicates that he is still welcome. This from Anderson, who unrepentantly insists that the democratically elected London mayor is colluding with Muslim extremists. That London is in effect under sharia law. They’re the fantasies of a not very bright far-right droid. But Rish! essentially lets it go. Unable to say the I word: Islamophobia. On and on Sunak went about how the UK was close to breaking point. Does it feel that way to you? There was one laugh-out-loud moment when he appealed to those marching for peace not to let their protests be hijacked by extremists. Just a week ago, the prime minister was at a Welsh farmers’ protest that was hijacked by some climate crisis denial extremists. And Rish! was happy to have his photo taken with them. You couldn’t make this stuff up. The longer Sunak went on, the more desperate and the less effectual he sounded. And he was starting with a very low bar. We were basically a nice country, he said. Don’t let it be ruined by extremist idiots. Well, quite. He could start with those close to him. Democracy was increasingly fragile and needed protecting. Yup. Now remind me who elected the current prime minister. Or the one before that. Oh, that’s right. No one. This can’t go on. If Sunak really wants to know why the country feels as if it’s falling apart, it’s because we haven’t got a functioning government. All that he did get right was “enough is enough”. It is. Time for an election."

Updated at 7.06pm GMT    7.01pm GMT   The SNP MP Alison Thewliss has accused the Tory party of stoking up the culture war that has led to the extremism Rishi Sunak says he wants to stamp out.“The Tories are the architects of the culture war in the UK - and Rishi Sunak has spent his whole time in office promoting it,” she said. “The prime minister has repeatedly, and very deliberately, sought to stoke up divisions, pander to the far-right and pit communities against each other for electoral gain.“Whether it’s attacking refugees, insulting LGBT people, or failing to call out Lee Anderson’s Islamophobia for what it is - this is an attempt to rewrite history and people in Scotland see through it.“If the Tory government now wants to bring people together, it must start by changing its own record of divisive language and policies. For people in Scotland, the best way to end these culture wars is to make Scotland Tory-free by voting SNP.”     6.44pm GMT  Tories have sown 'division for years', Lib Dem leader says  The Liberal Democrat leader has, in effect, accused Rishi Sunak of hypocrisy, saying the prime minister’s promotion of some Conservative MPs who have made controversial remarks has “sowed the seeds of division for years”. “The British people will take no lessons from a prime minister and Conservative party who have sowed the seeds of division for years,” said Sir Ed Davey. “This is the same prime minister who made Suella Braverman his home secretary and Lee Anderson his party’s deputy chairman. “If the prime minister is serious about bringing people together, he would call a general election now so that the British public can decide the future of our country.”  Updated at 7.05pm GMT    6.40pm GMT  Citizens have a right to go about their business without intimidation, Starmer says  The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer appeared to back Sunak’s message calling for unity in the country. In a statement, he said: “The prime minister is right to advocate unity and to condemn the unacceptable and intimidatory behaviour that we have seen recently. It is an important task of leadership to defend our values and the common bonds that hold us together. “Citizens have a right to go about their business without intimidation and elected representatives should be able to do their jobs and cast their votes without fear or favour. This is something agreed across the parties and which we should all defend.”     6.22pm GMT   Sunak has been criticised by political opponents recently for failing to tackle “extremism” within his own party. He made no reference to that row as he addressed the broader issue of extremism in the UK. Coming closest to announcing some form of concrete action during his 10-minute speech, Sunak says:  If we are asking more of the police, we in government must also back up that call with action. To that end, this month, the government will implement a new, robust framework for how it deals with this issue to ensure that we’re dealing with the root causes of this problem, and that no extremist organisations or individuals are being lent legitimacy by their actions and interactions with central government. You cannot be part of our civic life. If your agenda is to tear it down. We will redouble our support for the Prevent programme to stop young minds being poisoned by extremism. We will demand that universities stop extremist activity on campus. We will also act to prevent people entering this country whose aim is to undermine its values. The home secretary has instructed that if those here on visas choose to spew hate, or protest, or seek to intimidate people, we will remove their right to be here.   Updated at 6.23pm GMT    6.13pm GMT   It’s notable that, when speaking in very general terms, Sunak explicitly calls out both “Islamists” and the “far-right” as extremist threats to the UK – indicating he perhaps wants to calm tensions across the board. But, when he picks out specific examples of behaviour he feels are unacceptable, he focuses solely on pro-Palestine demonstrations. He has said:  I respect that the police have a tough job in policing the protests we have seen and that they are operationally independent. But we must draw a line. Yes, you can march and protest with passion. You can demand the protection of civilian life. But no, you cannot call for violent jihad. There is no context in which it can be acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes on to Big Ben in the middle of a vote on Israel, Gaza. And there can be no cause that you can use to justify the support of a proscribed terrorist group like Hamas. And yes, you can freely criticise the actions of this government – or, indeed, any government – that is a fundamental democratic right. But no, you cannot use that as an excuse to call for the eradication of a state or any kind of hatred, or antisemitism. This week, I’ve met with senior police officers and made clear it is the public’s expectation that they will not merely manage these protests, but police them. I say this to the police. We will back you when you take action.   Updated at 8.34pm GMT    6.04pm GMT   In his time as prime minister, Sunak has devoted much of his political energy to attacking inward immigration, and conflating it with people seeking asylum. Yet he has used his speech to talk at length about how immigration has benefited the country.  Britain is a patriotic liberal democratic society with a proud past and a bright future. We’re a reasonable country and a decent people. Our story is one of progress of great achievements and enduring values. Immigrants who have come here have integrated and contributed. They have helped write the latest chapter in our island story. They have done this without being required to give up their identity. You can be a practising Hindu and a proud Briton, as I am, or a devout Muslim and a patriotic citizen, as so many are, or a committed Jewish person and the heart of your local community. And all underpinned by the tolerance of our established Christian church. We are a country where we love our neighbours and we are building Britain together.   Updated at 8.35pm GMT    5.57pm GMT  Galloway victory 'beyond alarming', Sunak says  Sunak says Galloway’s victory is “beyond alarming”. He has said:  In recent weeks and months, we have seen a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality. What started as protests on our streets have descended into intimidation, threats and planned acts of violence. Jewish children fearful to wear their school uniform lest it reveals their identity. Muslim women abused in the street for the actions of a terrorist group they have no connection with. Now, our democracy itself is a target. Council meetings and local events have been stormed. MPs do not feel safe in their homes. Longstanding parliamentary conventions have been upended because of safety concerns. And it’s beyond alarming that last night, the Rochdale byelection returned a candidate that dismisses the horror of what happened on 7 October, who glorifies Hezbollah and is endorsed by Nick Griffin, the racist former leader of the BNP.   Updated at 7.06pm GMT    5.50pm GMT  Sunak says extremist groups are a growing threat to British democracy  Rishi Sunak is speaking outside No 10. He says there’s a growing threat to British democracy – and refers explicitly to the election of George Galloway in the Rochdale byelection last night. The prime minister talks up the tolerance of the “pluralist, modern” country he says the UK is, but says this is under threat from people looking to capitalise on Hamas’ attacks on Israel, and the resulting assault on Gaza, to undermine British values. He names Islamist extremists and the far-right, calling them “two sides of the same extremist coin”.  Updated at 5.51pm GMT    5.26pm GMT   The prime minister is due to make his speech at 5.45pm GMT and it’s set to address events in parliament last week after the Speaker changed parliamentary convention due to concerns for the safety of MPs. Fears about MPs being targeted by demonstrators have grown in recent months, particularly among those who have called for an end to the fighting in Gaza. Sir Lindsay Hoyle cited security concerns as a reason for his decision to overturn parliamentary convention by granting a vote on a Labour amendment to an SNP Gaza motion last week.

        "content": "In the freezing dark outside Rochdale leisure centre, Hassan Ali, 26, celebrated George Galloway’s stunning victory hours before the result was officially declared. “We have created history tonight,” he said in the small hours of Friday, surrounded by dozens of young men, slapping each other on the back and video-calling friends in English, Urdu and Bengali.\n“Our families have voted for Labour for many years because they’ve got used to ticking the flower box, but this is a vote for change,” said Ali, a community worker.\nAround him, several men in their 20s said they had voted for the first time on Thursday in order to send Galloway to parliament – and deliver a message to Labour.\n“Labour have been running these streets for years and they’ve done nothing,” Ali said. “Starmer has betrayed the people of Rochdale and the Asian vote.”\nGalloway, the irrepressible agitator, is back in the Commons representing a fourth constituency in nearly four decades after urging voters to deliver “the ultimate protest” over Labour’s handling of the Israel-Gaza conflict.\nThe scale of his victory, winning a near-6,000 vote majority, was the final surprise in a byelection beset by chaos, controversy and allegations of dirty tricks.\nPolice officers guarded polling stations in parts of the Greater Manchester town in a way not seen in a British election in decades, while security was tight at the overnight count.\nTwo days earlier a man was arrested for sending a death threat to Rochdale’s former Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, who was contesting the seat for the anti-immigration Reform UK, which hired security guards and moved some of its staff out of a shared property over fears for their safety.\nNigel Farage’s party, which came sixth with a dismal 6% of the vote, lodged a formal complaint about Galloway’s team distributing leaflets outside polling venues on Thursday.\nThe complaint to Rochdale’s returning officer, which has been seen by the Guardian, accuses Galloway’s activists of “breaking the rules with impunity” – an accusation they would deny.\nGalloway’s team, meanwhile, claimed Labour had tried to solicit votes inside a polling station and said its banners had been torn down all over Rochdale.\nObservers will seek to draw wider lessons from Galloway’s striking victory, yet this was a contest virtually unprecedented in modern times. Labour, who had held the seat with a near-10,000 vote majority, abandoned its campaign after it emerged that its candidate had shared inflammatory conspiracy theories about Israel.\nBut Labour would be wrong to dismiss the result as an aberration. “I think this is a historic shift away from Labour,” said Wafa Hameed Salik, 43, before prayers outside Rochdale’s Bilal mosque on Friday.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labour party runs through Salik’s blood: his dad was a respected party figure locally – a road was named after him – and his uncle was until recently the Labour mayor of Rochdale. But he voted for Galloway having lost hope in Starmer’s party.\n“Labour always thought ‘oh, we have our voters and whatever’ but this is changing,” he said. Galloway’s campaign, he said, was “like an explosion”.\nThe 69-year-old ex-Labour MP, unseating his former party for the third time in another campaign fought largely on the Middle East, used a speech outside the Bilal mosque to ask Muslims how they would answer “on judgment day” when they were asked: “What did you do when Keir Starmer asked you to endorse what he has done?”\nSeen by some as cynical, divisive and manipulative, Galloway doubled down, describing the byelection in one of Britain’s poorest towns as “a referendum on Gaza”.\nOutside Rochdale’s mainly-Muslim areas, he sought to show he cared about local issues, delivering leaflets mentioning potholes and Primark – he promised to bring the shop to the town’s shopping centre – written on literature in the colours of the Palestinian flag.\nKhalid Javed, 64, who voted for Galloway in this election, said voters like him in Rochdale wanted to express their lack of trust in the political system. “We wanted to mess everything up,” he said. “We want to show that there’s no support for the major parties. We don’t want to listen, I despise these people. They don’t represent us.”\nThis dissatisfaction with the main parties is not exclusive to the Muslim community, however.\nDavid Tully, a local businessman and a political newcomer, finished second in the byelection with an extraordinary 21% of the vote. This meant three-fifths of the votes went to the insurgents, Galloway and Tully, more than double the number shared between the three main parties, although Labour’s campaign was cut short.\nHow this byelection result is reflected at the general election may be largely down to Labour. If the party can mend relations with the Muslim voters who flocked en masse to Galloway, then they will probably retake Rochdale within months. If not, the party could be out in the cold in the town for years.\nBack outside Bilal mosque, another worshipper – who did not want to give his full name – said he liked and respected Galloway but did not vote for him because the MP’s speeches, however powerful, were “not going to make a difference”.\n“What is he really gonna do? The whole world can’t do anything [to stop the conflict],” Mr Arfan, 34, said. Having previously voted for Labour and the Liberal Democrats, on Thursday he stayed at home: “I’ve got no faith in none of them. They’re useless.”"

        "content": "Keir Starmer has been told that Labour risks taking its Muslim voters for granted, as MPs said the party had a fight on its hands to win back support lost over its position on the Israel-Gaza war. The warning came after George Galloway swept to a stunning victory in the Rochdale byelection, winning nearly 40% of the vote after a contest beset by chaos and controversy, dominated by the Middle East conflict. The party’s biggest internal Muslim group said the result showed Starmer faced a “full-blown crisis”, while Neal Lawson, the director of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass, said Labour could be facing a slow collapse in support like that seen in the “red wall” and Scotland. After a campaign viewed as one of the more ill-fated and divisive in recent political history, Azhar Ali, cut adrift by Labour after inflammatory comments about Israel, limped home in a distant fourth place, winning just 7.7% of the vote. The decision to drop Ali came too late for Labour to nominate a replacement. “Galloway only won because Labour didn’t stand a candidate,” Starmer said on Friday. “I regret that we had to withdraw our candidate, and apologise to voters in Rochdale.” While it is possible that someone with the backing of Labour’s electoral machine could have held a seat that was won by nearly 10,000 votes in 2019 by the late Tony Lloyd, such a storming win for Galloway has spooked some in the party. “We’ve got a real fight on our hands,” one senior backbencher told the Guardian. “It will be messy. The Workers party [Galloway’s party] will stand candidates in large parts of the West Midlands, Birmingham, Pennine towns and areas like Redbridge, Waltham Forest and Newham where the Labour vote has split over Gaza. “Galloway’s win will also embolden other independent groups supporting prospective candidates. It’s going to be vicious and feel as though Labour has lost its grip, which simply isn’t true. We just need to strengthen our messaging.” The chair of the Labour Muslim Network said the party was “at crisis point” on the issue. “There is no doubt that there are some extenuating and extraordinary factors in Rochdale which won’t be repeated around the country,” said Ali Milani, a former Labour parliamentary candidate who has been critical of the party over Gaza. “But I think anyone who suggests that this isn’t evidence of a serious problem Labour has with the trust and support of the Muslim community, who Labour has enjoyed the support of for decades, is just burying their heads in the sand.” Lawson said that while it remained to be seen whether Rochdale was “a blip or part of a more seismic trend in terms of the Muslim community’s support for Labour”, the party should be mindful of how the first-past-the-post voting system (FPTP) had previously disguised slow collapses in Labour support in Scotland and northern “red wall” seats. “FPTP encourages Labour to take its big blocks of voters for granted in the presumption that they have nowhere else to go,” Lawson said. “The SNP, then Ukip/Brexit and via them the Tories, and now Galloway have proven to be alternatives. Labour MPs and candidates in seats with big Muslim votes will be nervous today. People don’t like being taken for granted.” Another MP said the problem with Gaza went wider than Muslim voters, given evidence of significant overall public support for a ceasefire. Nevertheless, senior Labour figures argued that too much should not be read into what one called a “unique” byelection. “We have lost support over this conflict in the short term. But it shouldn’t be overstated,” they said. “Galloway is a terrible man. We’ve seen this movie before. He gets into parliament and doesn’t really do anything before losing at the election.” A series of independent prospective candidates basing their campaigns on pro-Palestine messaging, including some ex-Labour councillors, plan to stand in May’s local elections in places including Bradford. “It can be easier for independents running for councils and if a whole lot of them won that could be worrying,” a Labour local government source said. “But at the same time, people pay less attention to local elections.” Rob Ford, a professor of politics at Manchester University, said any notable success for candidates standing on a pro-Palestinian footing in May would be “a big headache” for Starmer and his team. “Even the perception from some Labour MPs that they face a risk, whether or not that is real, means they will want help in the general election,” Ford said. “If you’re trying to win 150 target seats to get a majority, you really don’t want to be diverting resources to seats you thought were already in the bag.” Galloway, the hugely controversial former Labour MP who has previously won seats from his former party in Bethnal Green and Bow and in Bradford West, used a victory speech interrupted by hecklers to herald what he called “a shifting of the tectonic plates” in British politics. The wider result, however, pointed more towards the chaotic picture, with David Tully, a local businessman who stood as an independent, coming second ahead of the Conservative Paul Ellison, who spent a good chunk of the campaign away on holiday. The Reform candidate, Simon Danczuk, a former Labour MP who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager, was sixth. Ford said: “If you were ask a political scientist to design a byelection in which it would be impossible to draw any wider lessons, it might look a bit like this one.” The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Galloway’s win was “a dark day for the Jewish community”, describing him as “a demagogue and conspiracy theorist, who has brought the politics of division and hate to every place he has ever stood for parliament”."

        "content": "A Conservative donor paid £25,000 on Thursday night for a multi-course Japanese dinner with the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as part of an annual ball that raised more than £200,000 for the party, the Guardian has learned. The unknown bidder won the exclusive dinner for themselves and three other people during the event at the five-star Raffles hotel in Westminster, which was attended by Rishi Sunak and several of his cabinet ministers. The prize was one of five multi-thousand-pound lots auctioned during the invitation-only event, sources said. Other lots included a five-night stay at a Caribbean villa owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Bassim Haidar, a seven-night stay at a manor house in Barbados, a box at York races and a signed photograph of the cabinet. The event is further evidence of the Conservatives’ continued ability to attract significant donations even as they trail Labour in the polls by about 20 points. The party brought in just under £16m in donations in the third quarter of last year, three times as much as Labour. Labour’s Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said: “As ever, the one place in Britain that remains oblivious to the cost of living crisis is the inner circle of the Conservative party. When Jeremy Hunt delivers his budget in a few days’ time and says there are no extra funds available to mend our broken public services, we will remember where his true priorities lay this week.” The Conservative Winter Party, once known as the Black and White Ball, is a staple in the party’s fundraising calendar. Thursday night’s event was attended by several millionaire donors, including Haidar, who arrived in a personalised Rolls-Royce. A Conservative spokesperson said the party was not going to comment on the ball, describing it as a private fundraising event. Haidar, a Nigerian-born Lebanese entrepreneur whose business empire includes a financial services company and investments in medical cannabis, has become an increasingly prominent Tory donor in the last year. In 2023 he gave more than £320,000 to the party, £75,000 to the failed London mayoral candidate Moz Hossain and £10,000 worth of advertising to Lee Anderson, the recently suspended former Tory MP.   Related: Tories accused of hypocrisy for supporting farmers’ protests   Haidar has attracted attention in part for his luxury lifestyle, which includes a fleet of yachts. The entrepreneur told Boat International magazine in December that his lifestyle at one point resembled the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. Other high-rolling guests included Mohamed Mansour, the billionaire businessman and former Egyptian transport minister, and Henry Angest, the Swiss-born British banker. The event raised more than £200,000 for the party, including a bumper winning bid of £110,000 for the signed photo of the cabinet. The stay at Haidar’s beach house raised £50,000 while one at the Caribbean estate known as Colleton Great House raised £30,000. Sunak was among those to give speeches during the night, and personally presented the cabinet photograph to the winning bidder. Despite the high-profile guest list, one person who was there said the overall mood of the night was “downbeat”, reflecting the Tories’ perilous poll position less than a year from a general election."

(See 3.49pm.) But, speaking at the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen, he suggested the government was unlikely to extend the windfall tax on energy profits, even though this option is reportedly being considered. (See 3.06pm.)\n\n\n\n\n 3.49pm GMT \nSunak hints at further cuts to national insurance in budget next week\n\nRishi Sunak has hinted there could be further cuts in national insurance rates in next week’s budget because it allowed Westminster to help workers in Scotland hit by Holyrood’s income tax rises.\nThe prime minister told reporters in Aberdeen he was “very conscious” that he wanted to make life easier for people across the UK while the Scottish National party government at Holyrood wanted “to make life harder”.\nSunak said Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, had been pressing the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to cut national insurance again in next week’s budget. “For the very reasons outlined, I press hard that it is national insurance as opposed to income tax,” Jack said.\nIn a signal that tax policy will also be a key general election battleground in Scotland, Sunak said the UK government’s cut of 2p in national insurance rates in January helped workers in Scotland while ministers in Edinburgh were raising income tax for everyone earning above £28,850 from April.\nThat national insurance reduction was a “significant tax cut worth £450 for someone on average earnings of £35,000,” Sunak said. He went on:\n\nI believe in a country and a society where hard work is rewarded. That’s something that’s really important to me.\n\nThe prime minister was asked whether it was fair for Scottish employees if the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, cut income rates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, since that decision would simply widen the tax gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK. He replied:\n\nIt’s also important to us to be a government that delivers for people in every part of the United Kingdom. And I’m very conscious that, whilst the SNP is making life harder for hardworking people by putting their taxes up, I want to make life easier for people.It is a union tax cut. It’s a tax cut for everyone in work and the contrast between what we’re doing and what the SNP government is doing could not be starker.\n\n\n\n\n 3.44pm GMT \n\nThe SNP has described Rishi Sunak’s speech as a “blink and you’d miss it” affair. In a new release using this label, Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said:\n\nThe Tories have trashed the UK economy, slashed Scotland’s budget and sent the cost of living soaring. Rishi Sunak should have used his flying visit to apologise to families across Scotland who are skint and scunnered as a result of his government’s appalling record of failure.With a general election in sight, voting SNP is the way to make Scotland Tory-free at this election - and the way to get rid of unelected Tory governments for good with independence.\n\n\n\n\n 3.42pm GMT \n\nAngela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, accused the Tories of “crashing the economy and expecting the north to pay for it” at the Conference of the North in Leeds.She said the government had “never followed through” on their commitment to levelling up. “They’re all talk with nothing to show for it.”Speaking about the north, Rayner said: “We don’t want to be on our knees asking for something.”Asked by an audience member about local authority funding, she also reiterated a pledge to provide more long-term funding to local councils and ending the “Dragon’s Den approach” where councils bid for small pots of money.\n\n\n\n 3.38pm GMT \n\nDouglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, is asking the questions during Sunak’s Q&A. He asks about the policing of protests.\nSunak says recent events have been concerning: MPs having their homes surrounded, council meetings being disrupted, antisemitic tropes being beamed on parliament, and the Commons changing procedural rules because of safety fears. He goes on:\n\nIt’s really concerning. What we’ve been seeing over the past few weeks or \nThere is a minority of people who are trying to undermine our values. I don’t think that’s acceptable …\nOf course, people have a right to protest, but that has to be done respectfully, and peacefully. Sadly, too many of the things we’ve seen recently have crossed the line. \n\nSunak says he plans to say more on this topic later today.\n\n\n\n 3.32pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak is now doing a Q&A at the Scottish Conservative party conference.\nHe says there is a clear contrast between the SNP government, which is putting taxes up, and the UK government which is delivering “one of the biggest tax cuts for workers that we’ve seen in recent time”.\n(As usual, Sunak does not mention the fact that the tax cuts that came into force this year are far smaller than the cumulative real-terms tax increases that have taken effect since 2019.)\nAnd Sunak makes the point that Scottish people will benefit from the cut in national insurance because “as Alister [Jack, the Scottish secretary] is always keen to remind the chancellor, national insurance is a UK-wide tax”.\nThere has been a lot of speculation that the chancellor will cut national insurance by 1p in the pound in the budget. Sunak’s comments could be a hint that the speculation is correct.\n\nUpdated at 3.49pm GMT\n\n\n 3.07pm GMT \nSunak says poll putting Tory support at 15% in Scotland 'not reflective of what we're hearing on ground'\n\nRishi Sunak fielded 16 minutes of questions from a group of 20 Scottish political journalists before his conference speech, in marked contrast to the chaotic and angry scenes at last year’s event when reporters rebelled against attempts by Downing Street officials to hand-pick just six newspaper reporters to meet and interview him.The Sun asked Sunak whether he would like to congratulate Humza Yousaf, the Scottish National party leader and first minister, on the news that he and his wife Nadia El-Nakla are expecting their first child. (See 2.46pm.) The Sun said the latest opinion poll, which puts the Scottish Tories on 15% for Westminster voting intention, suggested the child would grow up “in a Tory-free Scotland”.Sunak laughed. He said Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, had texted his and Sunak’s congratulations to Yousaf earlier on Friday on the “wonderful news” about the pregnancy.\nOn the Survation poll’s 15% finding, Sunak said:\n\n[This] is just not reflective of what we’re hearing on the ground, the recent success that we’re having in council byelections. And I think come the election, because that’s ultimately the only one that matters, I think we expect to gain when it comes to Scotland. And that’s because our messages resonate.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.13pm GMT\n\n\n 3.07pm GMT \nSunak defends accepting controversial air travel donations\n\nQuestioned further by reporters in Aberdeen, Rishi Sunak refused to say whether the Tories would return a donation of £38,500 in kind from a medical devices entrepreneur, Akhil Tripathi, who is reportedly being sued by investors, if the allegations against him are upheld.Tripathi, who has denied all the allegations, donated flights to Sunak to attend last year’s Scottish Conservative conference in Glasgow last April and to the Welsh Conservative conference the same day. \nSunak later updated his register of interests amid questions about the accuracy of original entries in a row which added to the complaints about the prime minister’s use of private helicopters and jets for party business.Sunak said:\n\nAll the donations to the Conservative party are transparently declared, as of course they should be, and they’re all in line with the established processes and regulations that govern those things.\n\n\n\n\n 3.06pm GMT \nSunak hints government unlikely to extend windfall tax on energy companies in budget\n\nRishi Sunak has refused to comment on reports from Bloomberg that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is considering extending the windfall tax on energy profits in next week’s budget. Yet he hinted it was highly unlikely by insisting the Tories were “the only major party that has backed the North Sea oil and gas industry”.Speaking to reporters in Aberdeen before his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference, Sunak said no prime minister or chancellor would ever comment on speculation about a budget. He said:\n\nI’m sure you and everyone else will understand why it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on any speculation or fiscal policy ahead of the budget. \nBut what I can say is that we have consistently been the only major party that has backed the North Sea oil and gas industry, and you can see that most recently with the move to annual licensing, which we’re legislating for, opposed by everybody else. And the reason we’re doing that is because our country is going to need all gas for decades to come. And my view and our government’s view is that it’s right to get that from here at home.\n\n\n\n\n 3.06pm GMT \nSunak accuses SNP of putting 'political posturing' above interests of Scots\n\nSunak says the SNP “would take Scotland back literally 300 years” (before the Acts of Union). \nHe says they have been in power in Holyrood since before the invention of the smartphone. But their record is poor, he claims.\n\nIf you want to see better schools, more economic growth, safer streets, and a government that works for the whole of Scotland, then every day that the SNP remain in power is a wasted day. \n\nHe goes on:\n\nTheir obsession with tearing Scotland out of the United Kingdom is all consuming and it simply crowds out everything else. \nIn fact, they’re so obsessed with difference for different sake, that when we banned XL bullies, they said no, we’ll go our own way. \nThis political posturing has tragic consequences. And it just shows you that they put division above even the safety of our streets. \n\nThis passage is confusing, because the Scottish government has broadly adopted the UK government’s approach.\nSunak also accuses the SNP of not being able to answer basic questions about independence.\n\nAstonishingly, after even 16 different papers on independent independence, they still can’t answer the basic questions. What’s the currency going to be? What happens to pensions? What happens to trade?it’s their obsession with independence that is holding Scotland back.\n\n\n\n\n 2.58pm GMT \nSunak claims Tories only party in Scotland committed to protecting oil and gas industry\n\nRishi Sunak is now giving his speech to the Scottish Conservative party’s conference in Aberdeen.\nHe defends the party’s record. He says his party blocked the SNP’s gender recognition (reform) bill and it was Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, who vetoed it.\nThe UK govenrment is cutting taxes, he says. But the SNP government is putting up taxes for anyone earning more than £28,000 a year.\nAnd he claims the Conservatives are the only party defending the oil and gas industry.\n\n It’s only the Scottish conservatives who are defending our energy security and the thousands of jobs here in the north-east that depend on the oil and gas sector. A vote for anyone else is a vote to shut down this industry.\nAs for Labour, it says so much about them that they don’t want to ban oil and gas – they just want to ban British oil and gas, with a ban on North sea exploration. \nIt shows so clearly that their values are not our country’s values, that they put virtue signalling ahead of our nation’s energy security.\n\n\n\n\n 2.46pm GMT \nHumza Yousaf says he and his wife expecting baby this summer\n\nHumza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has announced he and his wife are expecting a baby this summer, saying they are “delighted” to be adding to their family, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nYousaf said his wife Nadia El-Nakla is due to give birth in July.\nIt will be the first time a Scottish first minister has had a child while in office.\nThe couple already have two children – their daughter Amal is four and Mr Yousaf is stepfather to 14-year-old Maya.\nYousaf has previously spoken publicly about miscarriages the couple have suffered.\nAs he spoke about his desire to improve miscarriage care last September, he revealed he and El-Nakla have lost four pregnancies – “two before our daughter was born and another two after”.\nAnnouncing his wife is expecting again today, he thanked staff at the early pregnancy unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee for the “wonderful support” they have provided.\n\n\n\n\n 2.28pm GMT \n\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has said that Labour was right to apologise to the people of Rochdale for what happened in the byelection. Speaking in a press conference in Leeds at the Convention of the North event, he said:\n\nLabour has let the people of Rochdale down because it didn’t give them a good enough choice at the election held yesterday.\nIt’s right that the leader of the party has apologised to the people of Rochdale but we will now work with him and his team to make sure there is some reflection on what has happened, some honesty, so that we can all come together and work together to regain the trust of the people of Rochdale, and that is exactly what we will do working with the leader of Rochdale borough council.\n\n\n\n\n 1.34pm GMT \nSunak fails to deny government considering abolishing non-dom status in budget\n\nIn his TV clip for broadcasters Rishi Sunak refused to comment on reports saying the government is considering lifting Labour’s plan to abolish non-dom status as a means of raising revenue to fund a general tax cut in the budget. \nSunak said it would not be appropriate to comment on tax matters ahead of a budget. \nThis counts as a non-denial, because budget “purdah” has never stopped the government ruling out potential tax increases ahead of a budget if it wants to.\nAsked about the report in an interview on Sky News this morning, Ellie Reeves, the party’s deputy national campaign coordinator (and sister of Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor), said that if the Treasury did adopt the Labour plan, it would be further proof the government was “out of ideas after 14 years”.\nShe said the government had already borrowed other Labour ideas, like the windfall tax on energy companies and the dental recovery plan.\n\n\n\n 1.18pm GMT \nSunak insists Rwanda policy 'worthwhile investment' despite NAO saying it could cost £1.8m per asylum seeker\n\nRishi Sunak’s flagship plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda will cost taxpayers £1.8m for each of the first 300 people the government deports to Kigali, the National Audit Office has revealed. The NAO report is here, and here is Rajeev Syal’s story.\n\n Related:Rwanda plan to cost UK £1.8m for each asylum seeker, figures show \n\nIn his broadcast clip, Rishi Sunak was asked if he still thought the Rwanda deportation policy was a good deal in the light of what the NAO said about how much it would cost. Sunak insisted it was a “worthwhile investment”. He said:\n\nThe current situation is unsustainable and unfair. Taxpayers are already forking out millions of pounds a day to house illegal migrants in hotels across the country. That’s not right. And that’s why I made stopping the boats one of my priorities.\nI’m pleased that we’ve made progress last year, the numbers were down by a third. That’s never happened before, shows that the plans are working. But in order to fully resolve this issue, we need to have a deterrent, we need to be able to say if you come here illegally, you won’t be able to stay, we can remove you to a safe country.\nThat’s why the Rwanda scheme is so important. It’s a worthwhile investment, and I’m determined to see it through.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.18pm GMT\n\n\n 12.53pm GMT \nSunak says Rochdale byelection 'one of most divisive in recent times'\n\nRishi Sunak has described the Rochdale byelection as “one of the most divisive in recent times” and claimed he was pleased his party at last ran a positive campaign.\nSpeaking in Scotland, where he will be addressing the Scottish Conservative party’s conference in Aberdeen this afternoon, Sunak said:\n\nIt was very concerning to see the reports of intimidation through the byelection, and by all accounts one of the most divisive campaigns that we’ve seen in recent times.\nI’m pleased the Conservative party was the only party to run a really positive campaign focused on local issues with a great local candidate, Paul Ellison.\n\n\n\n\n 12.24pm GMT \nStarmer apologises to voters for Rochdale result, but says he was right to disown Labour's candidate\n\nKeir Starmer has restated Labour’s apology to the people of Rochdale for what happened in the byelection. But, in a clip for broadcasters, he sought to extract a positive message from the saga, suggesting that his decision to disown Azhar Ali, the candidate, over antisemitism at a point where it was too late to replace him showed his determination to transform the party.\nStarmer said:\n\nGalloway only won because Labour didn’t stand a candidate. \nI regret that we had to withdraw candidate and apologise to voters in Rochdale. \nBut I took that decision. It was the right decision. And when I say I changed the Labour party, I mean it. \nObviously we will put a first class candidate, a unifier, before the voters in Rochdale, or the general election.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.26pm GMT\n\n\n 12.15pm GMT \n\nAccording to Sam Coates on Sky News, George Galloway will be introduced by Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, and David Davis, the Conservative former Brexit secretary, when he takes his seat in the Commons next week. \n\n\n\n 12.09pm GMT \nTeaching unions criticise government's advice to pay review body for salaries in 2024-25\n\nTeaching unions in England have been angered by the Department for Education’s evidence to the independent School Teachers Review Body (STRB), ahead of the body’s pay recommendations for 2024-25.\nThe DfE has not named a percentage increase that it would support, and instead asked the STRB that the pay award be “sustainable” in the light of school finances - implying that schools can’t expect anything in the coming budget.\nThe DfE’s case is that pay increased by 5% per cent for most teachers in 2022 and a further 6.5% last year. It also argues that a forecast rise in unemployment “is expected to ease the level of vacancies across the private and public sector, supporting recruitment and retention” - in other words, that fewer teachers will leave the profession if unemployment is higher elsewhere in the economy.Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said:\n\nThe government evidence talks about teacher pay awards returning to a ‘more sustainable’ level – but it is the damage to education caused by government policy that is not sustainable. The recruitment and retention crisis, driven by pay cuts and excessive workload within an environment of funding shortages, is causing severe damage not just to teachers and school leaders but to the pupils and communities they serve.We need a fully funded, major correction to teacher pay to repair the damage to teacher living standards and to the competitive position of teaching, and to protect our education service.The NEU is opening on Saturday a preliminary ballot of teachers members in England calling for a fully-funded above inflation pay increase. This latest announcement from government will anger our members. Strike action is a last resort but it will be an option our members will seriously consider.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.11pm GMT\n\n\n 12.04pm GMT \n\nAzhar Ali was selected as Labour’s candidate in Rochdale (before he was disowned) after narrowly beating Paul Waugh in the selection contest. Waugh is a prominent political journalist who gave up his job as the i’s chief political commentator to try to become Labour MP for his home town, and he must have a good chance of being selected as Labour’s candidate for the general election.\nIn a column for the i, which blames Ali for Labour’s defeat, Waugh argues that his town won’t benefit from having George Galloway, with his “bilious brand of divisive politics”, as its MP. He says:\n\nThe sign that greets everyone coming from the M62 declares “Rochdale – birthplace of co-operation”, highlighting that it was here in 1844 that a group of weavers got together to form a co-op, the start of what became a global movement for social justice.\nBut Galloway has always preferred confrontation to co-operation, bombast to bread and butter issues. His previous election and by-election campaigns have seen appalling abuse directed at Labour women like Naz Shah in Bradford and Kim Leadbeater in Batley and Spen.\nHe arrives in a blaze of noise and publicity, but often doesn’t stick around. Sooner or later, people realise it’s all about him, not them. Like all circuses, he’ll leave this town eventually too, the question is how much damage he leaves in his wake.\nMany people of all backgrounds are appalled by the death toll of women and children in Gaza in Israeli attacks. But when Galloway explained his priorities for Parliament, he actually admitted in one interview that if he got to the Commons he would speak about Gaza first, then Rochdale “second”.\nYet even those who care passionately about Gaza actually have more local concerns. When I canvassed for Labour, before Azhar Ali was disowned, it was the cost of living, the state of the NHS, town centre crime and the shortage of affordable housing that were raised most often on the doorstep.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.25pm GMT\n\n\n 11.48am GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nAny idea @AndrewSparrow on what basis Prof Sir John Curtice says “although most Labour supporters don’t take a side in the current conflict in the Middle East”?\n\nThis is a reference to what Curtice said on BBC Breakfast this morning. (See 8.42pm.) He seemed to be referring to a polling question that asks people if they sympathise more with the Israelis or more with the Palestinians in the Middle East conflict. As this YouGov chart, with data going back to 2019, shows, amongst the public at large there is more sympathy for the Palestinians than for the Israelis, but generally there are even more people who say they sympathise with neither side, or who don’t have an answer. \nAmongst Labour supporters, there is much more support for the Palestinians than there is for the Israelis. The chart below shows data for this group from a survey on 15 January. It suggests 56% of them do have a view (46% pro-Palestinians, 9% pro-Israelis), but Curtice was presumably trying to make the point that a sizeable chunk of Labour supporters don’t take sides. Or perhaps he has seen more recent or alternative data.\n\n\n\n 11.32am GMT \n\nNeal Lawson, director of Compass, the leftwing group committed to more pluralistic politics, says the Rochdale result suggests Labour has been taking its supporters for granted.\n\nWe don’t know if Rochdale is a blip or part of a more seismic trend in terms of the Muslim community’s support for Labour. But our first past the post voting system tends to disguise tectonic shifts in voting behaviours, as we’ve seen in Scotland and then the red wall.\nFPTP encourages Labour to take its big blocks of voters for granted, in the presumption that they have nowhere else to go. The SNP, then Ukip/Brexit and via them the Tories, and now Galloway have proven to be alternatives. Labour MPs and candidates in seats with big Muslim votes will be nervous today. People don’t like being taken for granted.\n\n\n\n\n 11.26am GMT \n\nRichard Tice, the Reform UK leader, has denied George Galloway’s claim that he invited Galloway to join his party (see 6.44am), Harry Cole from the Sun reports.\n\nTice: “I genuinely have no idea what Mr Galloway is referring to.

Here are the main points.\n\nGalloway said he would “love the crush the Labour party”. He said:\n\n\nI’d love to crush the Labour party. I see it as my mission in life. \nI don’t know if Sky will allow me to quote Malcolm X. But the difference between the wolf and the fox is this. The wolf is quite clear about its intentions. As it comes towards you, you know what it’s going to do. The fox on the other hand looks like it’s smiling, looks like it’s friendly. \nThat’s the difference between the Conservative party and the Labour party. And so my ire against the Labour party is for precisely that reason. The Tories don’t pretend to be friends of the people. The Labour party does.\n\n\nHe said he did not believe Keir Starmer was genuined committed to a ceasefire in Gaza. Asked if he thought Starmer genuinely wanted a ceasefire, Galloway replied:\n\n\nIf you believe that, I’ve got a bridge in London I could sell you going cheap. Nobody believes that. If he really did, he wouldn’t have wrecked the SNP motion in the house just a week or so ago. He would have backed the SNP’s motion. Or better he’d have called a debate himself and put his own motion down. \nHe didn’t do any of those things. He preferred to force the speaker into a monstrous manipulation of parliamentary conventions and cause the scenes that you saw. He’s a phoney. He’s doing everything that he can to protect Israel from the righteous wrath of the international community and the people of Britain.\n\n\nHe said he wanted the current state of Israel to be replaced by an enlarged, secular country, taking in Palestine, where Jews and Muslims could live together. He said:\n\n\nIf you’re really asking me what should be the final state of affairs in Israel and Palestine, well, my position is quite well known. I think there should be one democratic and secular state, between the river and the sea. And if I was doing their marketing, I’d call it the Holy Land.\n\nAsked if that meant he did not want Israel to exist, he replied:\n\nNo state has a right to exist, not the Soviet Union, not Czechoslovakia, not the Zionist apartheid state of Israel. I believe that the best solution for everybody is, as it was in South Africa, freed from apartheid, a democratic state where white people and black people, Jews, Christians, Muslims, live as equal citizens under the law. \n\n\nHe said he would speak up for the Palestinian in parliament. Asked what he planned to do when he returned to the Commons, he said:\n\n\nI’ll be using such parliamentary skills as I have acquired over the best part of 30 years, in six previous parliamentary terms. I’ll be using such gifts that God gave me as a speaker, as a debater.\nAnd I’ll be speaking for millions of people who feel that they’re not being heard by the British political class, or the journalists for that matter, that their earnest feelings of anguish about what’s happening in Gaza is being ignored, or worse distorted into a kind of Islamophobic fervour which the political class, and much of the media, has been whipping up over the last few weeks. \n\n\n\n\n 10.28am GMT \nGalloway's ally Chris Williamson provokes outrage by failing to condemn Hamas's massacre of Israelis on 7 October\n\nIn his Today programme interview Chris Williamson, George Galloway’s ally and deputy leader of the Workers Party of Britain, Galloway’s party, declined to condemn the Hamas massacre of Israelis on 7 October.\nAsked by Mishal Husain to condemn those attacks, Williamson replied:\n\nThe two main parties have not called for a ceasefire. They’ve not condemned the Israeli regime’s activities. You can’t expect to live in a situation where a people have been oppressed for 75 years and not expect a reaction.\n\nAsked if he was saying the attacks were understandable, Williamson replied:\n\nWhat about the Palestinian people that have been massacred over 76 years now. Where is the media outrage at that? In international law oppressed peoples have an absolute right to armed resistance.\n\nHusain said that did not cover killing innocent people, like children and the elderly. In response, Williamson claimed most of the innocent people killed on 7 October were killed by Israeli forces. Husain said the evidence did not show that, and she moved the discussion on as Williamson began to articulate a conspiracy theory about the Hamas massacre.\nHusain also asked Williamson if he was happy about the fact that Galloway was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National party. In a message on X yesterday, Griffin said:\n\nIf you follow me in #Rochdale, get out and vote for George Galloway today. He’s not perfect, but it’s the best way by far to stick two fingers up to the rotten political elite and their fake news media cronies.\n\nWilliamson replied:\n\nIf people want to endorse, you can’t spurn endorsement, or indeed control people who want to endorse a political party.\n\nHusain said that Griffin said on his X feed he wanting to free Britain from Zionist control. She said if Williamson was uncomfortable with Griffin’s endorsement, he could say so. Williamson replied:\n\nYou’re trying to damn George Galloway and the Workers party by association. It’s up to people. If they want to endorse a political party, that’s entirely a matter for them. I’m not going to play those games.\n\nWilliamson claimed Galloway, himself and the Workers Party of Britain had “a long track record of standing up to racism and bigotry in all its forms’.\nEllie Reeves, Labour’s deputy national campaign coordinator, was interviewed immediately after Williamson. She said:\n\nCan I just start by saying that I’m utterly appalled by Chris Williamson’s failure to condemn Hamas attacks on 7 October, and likewise his failure to distance his party from the endorsement of Nick Griffin.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.05pm GMT\n\n\n 9.56am GMT \nGalloway's election 'dark day for Jewish community', says Board of Deputies\n\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews has described the election of George Galloway as “a dark day for the Jewish community”. In a statement it said:\n\nGeorge Galloway is a demagogue and conspiracy theorist, who has brought the politics of division and hate to every place he has ever stood for Parliament. His election is a dark day for the Jewish community in this country, and for British politics in general. We believe he should be shunned as a pariah by all parliamentarians.\n\nAnd the Campaign Against Antisemitism has said:\n\nGiven his historic inflammatory rhetoric and the current situation faced by the Jewish community in this country, we are extremely concerned by how [Galloway] may use the platform of the House of Commons in the remaining months of this parliament.”\n\nGalloway has campaigned on behalf of Palestinians for all his politcal life, but he strongly denies being antisemitic.\n\n\n\n 9.35am GMT \n\nHere is a Guardian graphic showing the Rochdale results.\n Interactive\n\n    Rochdale byelection results\n   \n\n\nUpdated at 9.35am GMT\n\n\n 9.25am GMT \n\nChris Williamson said this morning that George Galloway’s return to parliament next week would send shockwaves through the corridors of power. (See 8.59am.) In his analysis of the byelection result, my colleague Peter Walker explains why that is unlikely.\n\nGalloway’s return to parliament comes only days after Rishi Sunak argued that “mob rule” had taken over British politics, a reference to regular pro-Palestine demonstrations and threats to MPs over the issue.\nExpect some politicians, perhaps Suella Braverman, who has already claimed Islamists are “in charge”, to respond to Galloway’s win via the ruthless targeting of one demographic as another sign of shattered community cohesion.\nThe reality is perhaps less apocalyptic, if nonetheless messy. Galloway won in the same way in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005, and Bradford West in 2012. He served one term in each with minimal impact in parliament, the country more widely, or, his critics said, for his constituents.\nGalloway will hope to arrive back in Westminster as the figurehead for Gaza. But he is too divisive and controversial a figure to have broad appeal, and past experience shows he much prefers campaigning to become an MP than the slightly more prosaic business of actually being one.\n\nPeter’s article is here.\n\n Related: What does George Galloway’s Rochdale byelection win mean for other parties? \n\n\n\n\n 9.19am GMT \nExperts play down suggestions Galloway's victory in Rochdale has wider political significance\n\nAcademics and commentators like Prof Sir John Curtice (see 8.42am) and Lewis Goodall (see 6.33am) have made brave attempts this morning to draw out some wider political implications from the results of the Rochdale byelection. But amongst the commentatriat the consensus seems to be that that the main takeaway is that there are no wider lessons from the result – or at least none that are significant.\nThis is from Keiran Pedley from the polling firm Ipsos.\n\n\nThe reason it’s hard to find a read across for Galloway’s win in Rochdale to national politics is because there isn’t one.— Keiran Pedley (@keiranpedley) March 1, 2024\n\n\n\nThe reason it’s hard to find a read across for Galloway’s win in Rochdale to national politics is because there isn’t one.\n\nThis is from James Johnson, a former No 10 pollster who now runs JL Partners.\n\n\nReasons I don’t think the Galloway win has lasting effects 1️⃣ Unique set of candidates2️⃣ By-election voters are different to General Election voters3️⃣ Galloway has a highly personal vote, hard to replicate4️⃣ Muslim vote is highest in very safe Labour seatsFrom @SkyNews pic.twitter.com/WkIyeZ48Yd— James Johnson (@jamesjohnson252) March 1, 2024\n\n\n\nReasons I don’t think the Galloway win has lasting effects1️⃣ Unique set of candidates2️⃣ By-election voters are different to General Election voters3️⃣ Galloway has a highly personal vote, hard to replicate4️⃣ Muslim vote is highest in very safe Labour seats\n\nThis is from Sam Freedman from Prospect magazine.\n\n\nA by-election where over 60% of the vote goes to (effective) independents tells us nothing about the general election or really anything at all beyond the specific contest. There will be takes nevertheless.— Sam Freedman (@Samfr) March 1, 2024\n\n\n\nA by-election where over 60% of the vote goes to (effective) independents tells us nothing about the general election or really anything at all beyond the specific contest. There will be takes nevertheless.\n\nAnd this is from Chris Hopkins, political research director at Savanta, who has written up his analysis of the significance of the result on a blog.\n\nAll by-election results need to be taken with a pinch of salt, but this one needs to be taken with a truckload. The immediate “what does this result mean?” questions are inevitable, but in my view the answer is very little. This by-election was bizarre beyond recognition; of the established parties, Labour and the Greens effectively disowned their candidates, the Liberal Democrats had their own local campaign controversy, the Reform candidate was a disgraced former Labour MP, and the Conservative candidate took a holiday midway through the campaign. All of these factors have contributed, to some extent, to Galloway winning and an inexperienced independent coming second …\nOn Labour, there are several questions to answer. The first, is that besides being a vocal voice in the House of Commons, what does Galloway’s victory actually mean for Labour? Personally, I don’t think Keir Starmer will be losing any sleep over this result. Indeed, all things considered, I don’t think Labour could have hoped for much from the result. Another question that will be posed will be “what would have happened if Labour selected a different candidate?” and I don’t think we can assume, based on these results, that a different Labour candidate who had been backed throughout the campaign would have just waltzed to an easy victory. A narrow Labour victory over Galloway, or even a defeat, with a different candidate, would have been far more humiliating than this one which Labour can effectively just write-off and move on from.\n\n\n\n\n 8.59am GMT \nGalloway's ally Chris Williamson claims his victory will 'send shockwaves through corridors of power'\n\nGeorge Galloway does not seem to be morning broadcast interviews this morning, but Chris Williamson, the deputy leader of Galloway’s Workers Party of Britain, was on the Today programme speaking on his behalf.\nWilliamson, a former Labour MP who left the party after being suspended over allegations of antisemitism, claimed Galloway’s win would “send shockwaves through the corridors of power”. He said Galloway would use his platform in the Commons to speak up for the Palestinian people “against the genocidal Israel regime”.\n\nGeorge Galloway is probably the best orator in the world.\nHe’s now got a place in the corridors of power in Westminster, where the government and the official Opposition are effectively facilitating the genocide in Gaza. And so he will be able to speak truth to power.\nNot just in Rochdale. the whole country was watching this result and, indeed, people around the world were watching this result. And it will send shockwaves through the corridors of power and give a huge boost to those insurgent political parties and groupings and independents who are looking to provide a genuine alternative to the political class who have completely failed.\n\n\n\n\n 8.42am GMT \nConservatives and Labour both did very badly in 'unique' Rochdale byelection, says John Curtice\n\nProf Sir John Curtice, the leading psephologist, delivered his verdict on the significance of the Rochdale byelection on BBC Breakfast this morning. Asked if he agreed with George Galloway’s claim that both main parties had been “spanked” (see 6.33am), he said that he did – although he also stressed that it was a unusual contest and Keir Starmed remained “well on course to win a general election.\n\nCurtice said this was a “unique” byelection, making it harder than usual to draw wider conclusions from the result. He said:\n\n\n[This was] a unique contest contested by a candidate with a unique ability to appeal to the Muslim population in a town that also has a past record of voting on local issues.\n\n\nHe said that the Tories suffered their biggest fall in vote share in a Labour seat in a byelection in this parliament. He said:\n\n\nFrankly, here is another poor Conservative performance. The Conservative vote down by 19 points – it’s the biggest drop in the Conservative vote in a Labour-held seat in a byelection in this parliament …\nThere is no sign here of the electoral gloom that hangs over the Conservative party is in any way dissipated by Sir Keir Starmer’s difficulties.\n\n\nHe said Labour suffered its biggest drop in support in a post-war byelection in Rochdale. He said:\n\n\nOf course, Mr Galloway does have a track record of doing well in constituencies with large Muslim populations, particularly at a time when there is particular concern amongst that community about events in the Middle East. In 2005, when he won Bethnal Green, it was the Iraq war. Now, it’s Sir Keir Starmer’s relatively, I emphasise relatively, uncritical reaction to Gaza that Galloway was firing at.\nThe truth is Labour’s vote was going to to down given that they disowned [their candidate]. But Labour’s vote literally collapsed. This is the biggest drop in Labour support in a post-war by election.\n\n\nHe said the result was likely to worry some Labour MPs, and that Starmer could come under pressure to change his policy on Gaza. He explained:\n\n\nIt does mean that Labour MPs who are representing constituencies with large Muslim populations who have been told that they may face candidates standing on a pro-Palestinian platform … will be looking to Sir Keir perhaps to toughen his stance on Israel in order to try to head that off …\nAlthough the Labour party is well-insulated against a challenge in Muslim constituencies, because most of these seats that Labour represents have very large Labour majorities … although most Labour supporters don’t take a side in the current conflict in the Middle East, those who do, both Muslim and non-Muslim, are much more likely to support the Palestinian side than the Israeli side. That does raise a question for Sir Keir Starmer.\n\n\nBut Curtice said it was “unlikely” that any other candidates standing on a pro-Palestinian platform would be able to exploit the issue as successfully as Galloway.\n\n\nHe said Galloway was not the only candidate causing problems for the two main parties. He said:\n\n\n[Rochdale] is a constituency with a past record of voting for a local champion who expressed discontent in the town. Previously it was Cyril Smith, the former Liberal MP, now of course since disgraced. Now we’re seeing David Tully, this time an independent candidate, seemingly being more effective at expressing the discontent of people in Rochdale. So it isn’t just Mr Galloway who’s spanked both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer, it’s also Mr Tully as well.\n\n\n\n\n 8.12am GMT \nLabour's Ellie Reeves rejects suggestions party needs to change its policy on Gaza in response to Rochdale defeat\n\nIn her Sky News interview Ellie Reeves, Labour’s deputy national campaign coordinator, rejected suggestions that the party needed to change its stance on Gaza in response to the byelection defeat. She said:\n\nWe’ve set out our position on Gaza and that was adopted by the Commons just the other week. We’ve said there should be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, that the loss of life has been intolerable, there must be no ground offensive in Rafah, aid has to be ramped up into the region, and, importantly, that we need to find a two-state solution. What shouldn’t just be sort of empty words by politicians, but a political reality rather than an aspiration. A Labour government would work tirelessly to make sure that happens.\n\nAsked if Labour would toughen its policy, making it more pro-Palestinian, Reeves replied:\n\nWe’ve set out our position. We’ve called for that immediate humanitarian ceasefire. That’s in line with international partners in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. And it’s something that we’re pushing hard for.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.20am GMT\n\n\n 7.55am GMT \n\nEllie Reeves, Labour’s deputy national campaign coordinator, doing the media round on behalf of the party this morning. Appearing on Sky News this morning, she restated the apology to the people of Rochdale offered by the party this morning. (See 6.55am.)\nAsked which candidate Labour wanted to win, she said that was a matter for voters in the constituency.\nShe said the party would now select a candidate for the general election able to unite people. Asked if she was confident Labour would win the seat back, she said the party was not complacent.\nAt the end of the interview Reeves was asked if she would like to offer her congratulations to George Galloway. She replied: “I think we’ll leave it there.”\n\n\n\n 7.43am GMT \n\nOn the Today programme this morning Allen Brett, a former Labour leader of Rochdale council, said he did not think the byelection “will have much effect nationally”. He would not say how he voted, it was not for George Galloway, he said. “I don’t think he’s for Rochdale, I think he’s for himself,” Brett said.\nBrett said that he was impressed by the Dave Tully, the independent candidate who came second. “He’s a lovely fellow,” he said. He went on:\n\nIf he’d had a bit more professional advice to start with, I think he would have done even better. He did not even know that he could send everybody a leaflet via the post.\n\nIf Labour had had a proper candidate, Galloway would not have won, he said. He added:\n\nI think locally the Labour party needs to ask why they rubbed this election.\n\n\n\n\n 7.33am GMT \n\nNimo Omer has a good overview of the Rochdale byelection result in her First Edition briefing. Here is an extract.\n\nThe mood in the room was mixed when the results came in. There were a lot of Galloway supporters both inside the room and outside. “Dozens of people were there for hours, practising their chants on a freezing cold night in Rochdale,” Josh [Halliday, the Guardian’s north of England correspondent] says – a microcosm of the zeal and vigour of Galloway’s supporters.\nThe deep divisions laid bare over the course of the campaign were palpable too: “As [Galloway] prepared to stand on the victory podium, I heard mutterings from other campaigners of ‘terrorist sympathiser’, ‘the people of Rochdale are thick’ and ‘woe to Rochdale’,” Josh says.\nGalloway made it clear what he thinks his victory means for the Labour party: more losses in the coming general election. He wants to create a movement in towns and cities with similar profiles to Rochdale: “I think this victory tonight will spread far,” he said, adding that the win “could be the beginning of something new, something big”.\nDespite the stunning landslide on Galloway’s side, Josh says it is important to keep perspective: “You’ve got to take this with a pinch of salt. This is a byelection, it’s got a lower turnout than a general election and also Labour has not put up a fight for the last two and a half weeks of the campaign.” Were Labour to actually stand in a general election, the results would likely be far closer, he adds, though Galloway could still win again.\n\nAnd here is the full article.\n\n Related: Friday briefing: Labour suffers a huge loss as Galloway takes Rochdale \n\n\nUpdated at 8.40am GMT\n\n\n 7.14am GMT \n\nLewis Goodall from the News Agents podcast has posted a good thread on X about the significance of Galloway’s victory in Rochdale. It starts here.\n\n\nWhat does the Galloway victory mean?For the general election, very little. This was a unique by election and little is transferable. But it does change politics before the election and possibly tells us something about the shape of politics after it as well.🧵 https://t.co/HXT7feY0nZ— Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) March 1, 2024\n\n\n\nWhat does the Galloway victory mean?For the general election, very little. This was a unique by election and little is transferable. But it does change politics before the election and possibly tells us something about the shape of politics after it as well.\n\nAnd here are some of his points.\n\nMore broadly, as Galloway’s election win will inspire and energise some on the left, it will incense the right. They will argue it proves some of their dark warnings about a rising radical Islamist party right. They’ll argue this is a portent of things to come.\n\n\nBut for now, this is mainly noise. In electoral terms, it won’t matter at all. Labour will probably win the seat back in the general. Most of his MPs loathe Galloway . Starmer will hope the ceasefire comes soon to take a little of the political pressure away.\n\n\nThere’s little doubt Starmer and Labour have been doing less well with Muslim voters than in the Corbyn years. That was true before Gaza and it’s become more pronounced since. Right now that isn’t a huge problem for Labour as their overall poll lead is so massive...\n\n\n..but after an election and with the hard yards of governing begun, you can entirely see the circumstances where it becomes a problem. Poll lead vanishes and suddenly there are lots of seats in play like Rochdale where the Muslim vote isn’t massive but potentially pivotal.\n\n\nThe Tories meanwhile will at least be relieved that though their candidate performed abysmally Reform didn’t do much better. All eyes for them on Blackpool. But this is a story which is basically about Labour mismanagement. A complete car crash.\n\n\n\n\n 7.05am GMT \nMomentum says Labour's defeat in Rochdale 'self-inflicted loss'\n\nMomentum, the leftwing Labour group, has described the party’s defeat in Rochdale as a “self-inflicted loss”. A party spokesperson said:\n\nThis was a needless and self-inflicted loss for Labour.\nFirst, Starmer’s utterly factional selection processes resulted in a candidate who was clearly unfit for office. Then the Labour Leadership tried to defend him as one of their own. Finally, Keir Starmer’s failure to stand with Gaza in its hour of need left the door open for George Galloway. \nTo avoid any more damaging repeats, Starmer should end the factional abuse of Labour’s selection processes and stand up for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaze.\n\n\n\n\n 7.00am GMT \n\nNicholas Watt from Newsnight interviewed George Galloway as he was leaving the count. Galloway told him:\n\nIf you believe that Keir Starmer is genuinely seeking an end to the slaughter in Gaza, I’ve got a bridge in London that I could sell you.\n\n\n\nCry more, cry more. George Galloway gives me some advice as I encounter him at his Rochdale campaign HQ ⁦@BBCNewsnight⁩ pic.twitter.com/e6xQbPzajh— Nicholas Watt (@nicholaswatt) March 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.55am GMT \nLabour apologises to Rochdale for byelection result, saying Galloway only won because it did not have proper candidate\n\nLabour says George Galloway is “only interested in stoking fear and division”. \nIn a statement issued about the byelection result, the party apologised to the people of Rochdale for the fact that it did not have a proper candidate. (Azhar Ali, who was selected as Labour’s candidate, was disowned by the party after nominations closed because it was revealed that he had made antisemitic comments after the Hamas attack on Gaza. But it was too late to change nominations, and so he was listed as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper.) A Labour spokesperson said:\n\nWe deeply regret that the Labour party was unable to field a candidate in this byelection and apologise to the people of Rochdale. George Galloway only won because Labour did not stand.\nRochdale deserved the chance to vote for an MP that would bring communities together and deliver for working people. George Galloway is only interested in stoking fear and division. As an MP he will be a damaging force in our communities and public life.\nThe Labour party will quickly begin the process to select a new Labour candidate for the general election, and will be campaigning hard to deliver the representation and fresh start that Rochdale deserves.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.56am GMT\n\n\n 6.44am GMT \n\nAt the count George Galloway dismissed complaints from Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, about the result. (See 5.39am.) He claimed Tice had tried to recruit him as a candidate. Galloway said:\n\nI think Mr Tice has rather lost his balance, and Mr [Nigel] Farage too, and I remind Mr Tice that I have on my telephone a text from him inviting me to be the Reform UK candidate in a by-election not that long ago.\nI’d prefer not to publish it, but if he keeps telling lies about me I will have to tell the truth about him.\n\nAsked whether his supporters had engaged in bad behaviour, Galloway said:\n\nAbsolutely none. Ask the police, ask the police if a single one of our supporters has been arrested or spoken to by them.\n\n\n\n\n 6.42am GMT \nHow Galloway is returning to parliament for his third party, representing a fourth constituency\n\nHere is a profile of George Galloway by Helen Pidd and Ben Quinn.\n\n Related: George Galloway: constituency-hopping campaigner who is rarely far from controversy \n\n\n\n\n 6.33am GMT \nGalloway claims Labour has 'lost confidence of millions of their voters' who backed them 'generation after generation'\n\nGood morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Jonathan Yerushalmy.\nHere is more from what George Galloway said in his victory speech at the count.\n\nKeir Starmer – this is for Gaza. And you will pay a high price, in enabling, encouraging and covering for, the catastrophe presently going on in occupied Palestine in the Gaza strip.\nRochdale town councillors, I put you on notice now, that I hope to put together a grand alliance …\n\nAt this point Galloway was interrupted by a heckler calling him a climate change denier. She was drowned out by Galloway’s supporters chanting his name. He went on:\n\nThe councillors have to go.\nI want to tell Mr Starmer above all, that the plates have shifted tonight. This is going to spark a movement, a landslide, a shifting of the tectonic plates in scores of parliamentary constituencies.\nBeginning here in the north west, in the West Midlands, in London, from Ilford to Bethnal Green and Bow, Labour is on notice that they have lost the confidence of millions of their voters who loyally and traditionally voted for them, generation after generation …\nI’ve heard some of the narrative being spun around this election result this evening. Yes its true, that every Muslim is bitterly angry at Keir Starmer and his listing Labour party.\nBut you would be very foolish, if you did not realise that millions of other citizens of our country are too.\nKeir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked tonight!\n\nGalloway ended his speech saying: “God bless you. God bless Rochdale. God bless Gaza.”\nWe will be opening comments on the blog later.\n\nUpdated at 6.38am GMT\n\n\n 6.26am GMT \n\nHere are some images from the byelection count and Galloway’s victory speech:\n\n\n\n 6.04am GMT \n\nDuring his victory speech, Galloway was interrupted by a heckler accusing him of being a “climate change denier”.\nHe then had confetti thrown at him by Mark Coleman – who ran in the byelection as an independent candidate and is a supporter of Just Stop Oil.\n\n\n\n 5.57am GMT \n\nGeorge Galloway, one of the most divisive politicians in Britain, won almost 40% of the vote in a contest beset by chaos and controversy and dominated by the conflict in Gaza.\nLabour, defending a near-10,000-vote majority and riding high in the polls, had expected a straightforward contest to replace the sitting MP, Tony Lloyd, who died on 17 January from leukaemia. But its campaign was thrown into disarray when it emerged its candidate, Azhar Ali, had repeated anti-Israel conspiracy theories about the 7 October attack by Hamas.\nLabour was eventually forced to disown Ali and abandoned its campaign barely a week into the contest. Although Ali’s name was on the ballot paper – it was too late to select another candidate – Labour stopped all electioneering in the town nearly three weeks ago.\nGalloway, on the other hand, was galvanised. The fedora-sporting politician toured Rochdale with a megaphone, calling the byelection “a referendum on Gaza” and a chance to stage a protest against Labour.\nHis team, backed by an army of volunteers from across the country, managed to capture the vote of a significant number of Muslim people, who make up about 30% of the town’s population, with many angry about Labour’s position on Gaza.\nGalloway, an ex-Labour MP, has now unseated his former party in three elections and will return to parliament representing a fourth constituency in 37 years.\n\n\n\n 5.39am GMT \nReform UK leader Richard Tice claims byelection 'not free and fair' after his candidate comes sixth\n\nReform UK finished in sixth place with only 6.3% of the vote. A Reform UK source told the Guardian the party had under-performed due to logistics: the Rochdale contest was the third byelection it had fought in three weeks and it had been focusing on its party conference in Doncaster last weekend.\nRichard Tice, leader of Reform, speaking at the election count, said the poll in Rochdale had “not been a free and fair election”.\n\nWhat we witnessed here is deeply disturbing. Our candidate and campaign team have been subjected to death threats, vile racist abuse, been refused entry to hustings in council buildings and had to be re-located for their own safety.\nWe are supposed to be a beacon of democracy, this shameful contest has been more characteristic of a failed state.”\n\nEarlier this week a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to the Reform candidate, Simon Danczuk, who hired security guards for the final two days of campaigning.\n\nUpdated at 6.25am GMT\n\n\n 5.25am GMT \nRochdale byelection: full results\n\nGeorge Galloway’s campaign team claimed early on in the night that the former Labour and Respect MP would win “comfortably”, and so it proved.\nGalloway won 12,335 votes – 39.7% of the total – in a much more sweeping victory than anyone had predicted, giving him a 5,697-vote majority.\nThe surprise runner-up was David Tully, a local businessman and independent candidate, who secured more than 6,600 votes.\nHere are the full results from PA Media.

        "content": "The Rochdale byelection was an extraordinary electoral event. Not only did the combined share of the vote for the Conservatives and Labour drop by 63 percentage points – the worst result for the big two since the wartime byelections of 1941-45 – but the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Reform UK all slipped as well. However, Rochdale’s circumstances were so bizarre that one must be careful when drawing general conclusions about the implications for national electoral politics. The stereotype of Rochdale is that it is a deprived Labour stronghold. Although the town does struggle with social problems, the constituency includes some prosperous suburban and rural areas to the east of the town. Rochdale’s electoral history is varied and volatile. Labour has faced competition from the Lib Dems, who held the seat in 1972-97 and 2005-10. In 2015 the Lib Dem vote plunged and Ukip came second, in 2017 the Conservatives surged to second place, and in 2019 the Tories polled their highest share of the vote since they last won the seat in 1955. While there is usually a loyal Labour vote, the opposition to Labour floats around between Lib Dem, Tory and populist options. The mid-campaign disowning of Azhar Ali freed up the Labour half of the electorate to become just as volatile themselves. George Galloway’s victory was made possible by the demographics of Rochdale. There are only 17 constituencies with a higher proportion of Muslim residents than Rochdale’s 30.5%, two of which – Bethnal Green and Bow and Bradford West – have already had the experience of being represented by Galloway. Galloway’s campaigning has always centred around Muslim concerns; many of the arguments he made in Rochdale were updated versions of those from the Bradford campaign trail in 2012. Labour’s stand on the war in Gaza was potent fuel for protest votes, but the combustible material was always there.  Interactive  The consolation for Labour is that the general election will be different in at least two ways. The conversation will be about who is to form the national government, rather than the issues that surface in a one-off byelection. There is also only one George Galloway. Nobody else has the track record of electoral success, the network of support and the personal celebrity built in non-traditional media with wide reach among youth and minority populations. Labour is vulnerable in a few heavily Muslim constituencies, but will be spared from significant losses by the limited supply of viable Independent or small party challengers. It would be a mistake to read Galloway’s win exclusively in the context of Muslim politics and Gaza. He is canny at playing up traditional workerist and social conservative themes for left-behind white voters; he won the white suburban wards of Bradford West in 2012 and will have polled respectably among Rochdale’s majority of non-Muslim voters. Galloway was a more convincing populist than Reform UK’s Simon Danczuk; he even echoed Trump in his literature, calling to “make Rochdale great again”. The fact that many Muslims are willing to vote for a populist who tells them what they want to hear is not a distinction between Muslims and the rest of the population. The second place for the Independent candidate David Tully, with 21.3% of the vote, was almost as startling as Galloway’s victory. Tully went unnoticed by observers, but his campaign, based largely around local identity, made an impact on voters. Galloway and Tully represent alternative responses to the problems facing towns such as Rochdale. To Tully, the answer is to have an authentic local voice, distant from party politics, speaking for Rochdale in Westminster. The Galloway argument is that one is electing a parliamentarian, and that a noisy and controversial advocate is what Rochdale needs to put it on the map. Galloway is unique in modern politics for having represented four entirely different constituencies – in Glasgow, east London, Bradford and now Rochdale – but it is a distinction he shares with another Labour renegade, Ramsay MacDonald. Labour will probably recover Rochdale in the general election with a fully endorsed candidate and a proper campaign. But the disaffection from politics revealed by this strange election is a warning sign. The turnout of 39.7% was reasonably high for a byelection, higher than in the mainstream party contests at Wellingborough and Kingswood despite the absence of the Labour machine. Rochdale has an acute case of the politics of decline. Successive political projects – New Labour, Brexit, levelling up – have all been seen to fail, as central and local public services and infrastructure deteriorate. As well as Gaza, the electorate worried about health, crime and the decline of Rochdale as a retail centre. If Labour wins the general election, it may not have much time to turn things around before part of its core electorate loses patience."

He’s now got a place in the corridors of power in Westminster, where the government and the official opposition are effectively facilitating the genocide in Gaza.”\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews said Galloway’s victory marked “a dark day” for the UK’s Jewish community. A spokesperson said: “George Galloway is a demagogue and conspiracy theorist who has brought the politics of division and hate to every place he has ever stood for parliament.\n“His election is a dark day for the Jewish community in this country and for British politics in general. We believe he should be shunned as a pariah by all parliamentarians.”\nAli did not attend the count and the Guardian understands that other Labour campaigners were told to stay away.\nDespite a campaign dominated by events in the Middle East, Galloway said he hoped to put together a “grand alliance” with Rochdale councillors to work on local issues.\nDozens of Galloway supporters had gathered outside the leisure centre shortly after the polls closed, when it quickly became apparent he was set for a decisive victory. Inside the count, however, the mood was less hospitable. A family member of a rival candidate muttered “terrorist sympathiser” while another shouted “woe to Rochdale” after he was declared the winner.\nAnother heckler, who gave her name as Jane Twill, was removed by security after interrupting the victory speech by accusing Galloway of failing to address the climate emergency.\nGalloway’s team were so confident that they briefed reporters within an hour of the polls closing that he had won “comfortably” and announced plans for a “mass rally” immediately after the declaration at his election headquarters, a former Suzuki showroom.\nLabour, riding high in the polls, had expected a straightforward contest to replace the sitting MP, Tony Lloyd, who died on 17 January from leukaemia. But its campaign was thrown into disarray when it emerged its candidate had repeated anti-Israel conspiracy theories about the 7 October attack by Hamas.\nLabour was forced to disown Ali but with his name remaining on the ballot paper – it was too late to select another candidate – Labour stopped all electioneering in the town nearly three weeks ago.\nGalloway, on the other hand, was galvanised. The fedora-sporting politician toured Rochdale with a megaphone, calling the byelection “a referendum on Gaza” and a chance to stage a protest against Labour.\nHis team, backed by an army of volunteers from across the country, managed to capture the vote of a significant number of Muslim people, who make up about 30% of the town’s population, with many angry about Labour’s position on Gaza.\n Interactive\n\nStarmer’s party also faced a challenge from another former Labour MP in the form of Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager. Danczuk, Rochdale’s MP from 2010 to 2017, was standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Nigel Farage.\nDanczuk’s new party did poorly, finishing in sixth place with only 6.3% of the vote. A Reform UK source said the party had underperformed because of logistics: the Rochdale contest was the third byelection it had fought in three weeks and it had been focusing on its party conference in Doncaster last weekend.\nGalloway, 69, previously unseated his former party in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012, both following campaigns based heavily on events in the Middle East.\nLike Galloway’s previous campaigns, the Rochdale contest was mired in controversy. In the week when MPs were raising concerns over their safety, Galloway said the names of Labour MPs were “dripping in blood” after the party’s ceasefire amendment, which did not go as far as pro-Palestinian supporters wanted.\n\n Related: George Galloway: constituency-hopping campaigner who is rarely far from controversy \n\nEarlier this week, a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to Danczuk, who hired security guards for the final two days of campaigning.\nGalloway’s team said its banners and garden posts had been ripped down in an effort to stop it getting the word out.\nThere were allegations of dirty tricks on polling day too, as Reform UK lodged a formal complaint about Galloway activists distributing leaflets outside polling stations.\nRichard Tice, the leader of Reform, claimed the contest had not been “free or fair” and made unspecified suggestions that the postal vote had been rigged.\n“This byelection and result should act as a serious wake-up call to those in power and indeed to the entire electorate,” he said. “We are supposed to be a beacon of democracy, this shameful contest has been more characteristic of a failed state.”\nGalloway’s team had earlier accused Labour canvassers of speaking to voters inside polling stations."

        "content": "While George Galloway’s portentous declaration of “a shifting of the tectonic plates” was the sort of hyperbole he specialises in, his sweeping victory in the Rochdale byelection does carry some lessons for other parties, and not reassuring ones.\nIt is not the first or even the second time Galloway has swept aside his former party Labour by claiming to be the only candidate who can properly represent the interests of Muslim voters, rolling into town with a mass of eager volunteers and a platform based less on policy than on his fiery rhetoric.\nBut his capture of nearly 40% of the vote in Rochdale – with the cut-adrift Labour candidate, Azhar Ali, pushed into fourth place in a seat the party formerly held with a near 10,000 majority – has come in the context of the Gaza war, and the many divisions connected to it.\nAs demonstrated in November, when eight Labour frontbenchers resigned to vote for a ceasefire motion, and last week, when the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, allowed the party to duck a similar vote over concerns about intimidation, the party remains badly split on the issue.\n Interactive\n\nOf course, it is possible Labour would have held off Galloway had it not disowned Ali after it emerged he had suggested Israel had deliberately allowed the 7 October massacre by Hamas to take place.\nBut Galloway’s ability to galvanise voters aghast at the death toll in Gaza, particularly the roughly 30% of the town who are Muslim, via what was effectively a single-issue campaign with literature in the colours of the Palestinian flag, demonstrated the strength of feeling.\nIn the wake of the byelection, some observers have noted that while in Westminster support for an immediate ceasefire can almost feel a niche position, it is backed by a clear majority of the public.\nGavin Barwell, the former Tory MP who was Theresa May’s chief of staff, argued on Friday that recent protests should not be misrepresented. “The extremists are a very small minority but the truth is the British people overwhelmingly support a ceasefire,” he said.\nCould the Workers Party of Britain, Galloway’s latest political vehicle, remove other Labour MPs at the general election? That seems less likely given its tiny resources, plus the fact that, unlike in Rochdale, it would face the might of Labour’s campaigning machine.\nGalloway’s return to parliament comes only days after Rishi Sunak argued that “mob rule” had taken over British politics, a reference to regular pro-Palestine demonstrations and threats to MPs over the issue.\nExpect some politicians, perhaps Suella Braverman, who has already claimed Islamists are “in charge”, to respond to Galloway’s win via the ruthless targeting of one demographic as another sign of shattered community cohesion.\nThe reality is perhaps less apocalyptic, if nonetheless messy. Galloway won in the same way in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005, and Bradford West in 2012. He served one term in each with minimal impact in parliament, the country more widely or, his critics said, for his constituents.\nGalloway will hope to arrive back in Westminster as the figurehead for Gaza. But he is too divisive and controversial a figure to have broad appeal, and past experience shows he much prefers campaigning to become an MP than the slightly more prosaic business of actually being one.\nWhat else can we divine from Rochdale? For Reform, this was a gloomy night after relatively strong showings in last month’s Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections.\nIts candidate, the former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager, finished sixth behind an independent, the Liberal Democrats and a Conservative candidate who spent much of the campaign period on holiday.\nReform suggested this poor result was in part due to logistical exhaustion for the tiny party, and perhaps the most basic lesson of all from the byelection is that the nuts and bolts of campaigning and getting out the vote really do matter.\nOverall, this was something of a depressing spectacle for a town facing significant deprivation and numerous other problems barely addressed by many of the 11 men who vied to become its representative.\nThe Galloway circus has once again swept in, declared a revolution and will most likely slink out again, this time in a matter of months. The 69-year-old has another political scalp to brag about. And what has Rochdale got? For now, it seems, not much."

        "content": "Meeting Saddam Hussein in 1994, George Galloway told the Iraqi dictator: “I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.” Thirty years on, even Galloway’s most vocal opponents must salute his indefatigability, if nothing else, as the 69-year-old father of six takes yet another seat in parliament. His stunning win in Rochdale was his seventh parliamentary victory of a political career in which he has represented four cities and three parties across four decades, equalling Winston Churchill’s constituency-hopping record. Less Churchillian was his appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006, moonlighting from his day job as the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow by donning a red unitard and pretending to be a cat. The Rochdale win marks a late political resurrection for Galloway, whose traditional support among British Muslims might not have survived the sectarian dimensions of the Syrian civil war. He denied chemical weapons attacks by the regime and took a job on an Arab television channel said to be linked to Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad. However, anger over Israel’s offensive in Gaza offered a way back and when he pitched up in Rochdale in February, Galloway did not pretend to have strong links to the Greater Manchester town. He made a few local promises – to bring back a maternity hospital, as well as a Primark – but his was essentially a single-issue campaign, fought on Palestine and targeted squarely at the Muslims who make up 30% of Rochdale’s population. He repeatedly invoked religious imagery to win what he called the “ultimate protest vote”. Outside one mosque after Friday prayers, he asked worshippers whether on “judgment day” they would be able to tell their children and grandchildren that they had opposed Keir Starmer’s position on Gaza. It all felt very familiar to veterans of Galloway’s last byelection win, in Bradford West in 2012, when he was carried aloft from the leisure centre count shouting “All praise to Allah” as a crowd of young Hummer-driving Muslim men chanted: “Viva Palestina!” During that unpleasant campaign, Galloway annihilated the Labour vote by painting himself as a defender of the oppressed Muslims of Kashmir. He rarely plays nicely. In the 2015 general election, in which he lost his Bradford seat in a Labour landslide, he was widely criticised after ordering an intermediary in Pakistan to dig out the Islamic marriage certificate of his Labour rival, Naz Shah, in order to try to prove she had been 16, not 15 as she had said, when she was forced into a violent and sexually abusive marriage.   In 2019, after being sacked by TalkRadio for what it called his “antisemitic views”, he tweeted his old bosses to say: “See you in court guys … Long live Palestine.” He was given the boot from the station not long after it had been censured by the media regulator Ofcom for breaching broadcasting impartiality rules when Galloway cast doubt on Russian involvement in the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Many of those threatened with a libel suit do not go on to find themselves in court. The notable exception is the Telegraph, which ended up paying Galloway £150,000 in damages in 2004 after publishing a report claiming documents found in Baghdad during the Iraq war suggested he had received up to £375,000 a year from his old friend Saddam. So what can Rochdale expect from their new MP? Not a lot of work inside parliament, if Galloway’s track record is anything to go by. In three years as Bradford West’s MP he spoke just 16 times in the House of Commons, sometimes going for six months or more without saying a word in the debating chamber. When he did speak in parliament, it was usually about foreign affairs or to insult other MPs, once responding to an intervention from a Tory MP by saying: “I would much prefer to give way to the honourable gentleman than for him to cackle and wobble his ample girth from a sedentary position.” He did find time to make programmes for Russia Today and al-Mayadeen TV, topping up his MP’s salary by £12,400 a month. His globetrotting was relentless, taking time out from his duties in Bradford and Westminster to campaign for Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and to attend events all over the world. Controversy was never far away. Shortly after his election in Bradford, Galloway enraged anti-rape campaigners in Bradford when he described sexual assault allegations against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as merely “bad sexual etiquette”. The investigation into Assange was later dropped. Born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1954, Galloway became the youngest ever chair of the Scottish Labour party in 1981 and won his first parliamentary seat in Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) in 1987. Always on the far left of the party, he was expelled by Labour in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute over his prominent opposition to the Iraq war. He joined the Respect party and in 2005 won the London seat of Bethnal Green and Bow from Labour’s Oona King. Two years later he was suspended from parliament for 18 days after the Commons select committee on standards and privileges found “strong circumstantial evidence” that the UN’s oil for food programme had been used by the Iraqi government with Galloway’s “connivance” to fund the campaigning activities of his charity the Mariam Appeal. In 2019 the Charity Commission found that Viva Palestina, another charity set up by Galloway, to deliver aid to Gaza, may not have conducted any charitable activity or distributed any humanitarian aid despite claiming to have gathered £1m in public donations. While Respect fell apart amid rows involving constituent parts such as supporters from the Socialist Workers party and other factions, Galloway was involved in forming a new political vehicle in 2019, the Workers Party of Britain. It aimed to soak up disillusioned former Corbynists leaving Labour after its 2019 defeat but ultimately it became a Galloway vehicle, with political foot soldiers provided by the CPGB-ML, a Stalinist far-left group that is tiny in number and came with China links. Galloway was able to make to the most of his new role, addressing the Chinese regime’s second International Forum on Democracy in Beijing, where he quoted Xi Jinping approvingly and criticised “the form of democracy in western countries”. In an echo of Respect’s splits, the CPGB-ML withdrew but Galloway’s party has recruited figures including Chris Williamson, the former Labour MP who was suspended by that party after he criticised its handling of antisemitism allegations, and Peter Ford, a former UK ambassador to Syria. The move to sidle up to Beijing was pre-dated by an embrace of Russia, which involved Galloway echoing pro-Kremlin talking points on Ukraine although he threatened to sue what was then called Twitter after the social network labelled his account as “Russian state-affiliated media”. By then his radio programme The Mother of All Talk Shows was being broadcast on the Russian state-owned Sputnik service. Now back in parliament after a 12-year hiatus, Galloway has hinted he does not plan to spend his 70s as an outcast on the opposition benches. During the Rochdale campaign he repeatedly told voters he may be their MP for only “100 days” or however long until Rishi Sunak calls the next general election. To others he has suggested he would serve no more than one last full term in parliament. He told his old adversaries at the Telegraph that he was planning his retirement. “I’m 69 years old and my youngest child is three. Well, I really do have obligations to others,” he said. “Having said that, because it’s half-term where they live, all my children are here with me in the campaign. But, no, five more years will do me finally.” "

        "content": "The polls have closed in the Rochdale byelection after a chaotic race that dominated headlines, driven by conversations around the Israel-Gaza conflict. The favourite to win is the former Labour MP George Galloway, standing as the candidate for the Workers Party of Britain. He has also been a Respect party MP, and a Rochdale win would mean a fourth seat in parliament for Galloway since 1987. He has positioned himself as a pro-Palestinian voice, hoping to gain the support of thousands of disaffected Muslim voters. Labour’s divisive stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict has led much of Rochdale’s 30% Muslim population to withdraw their support for the party. Labour withdrew its backing for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over an inflammatory comment about Israel, but under electoral law it was not able to replace him. The byelection was called after the death of Labour’s Tony Lloyd from leukaemia on 17 January. The ensuing campaign became one of chaos, with two candidates having support withdrawn from their respective parties. Ali was an adviser to the last Labour government on anti-extremism for the Home Office from 2005 to 2010. In a leaked audio recording, he was heard claiming to Labour members that Israel “deliberately took the security off” to knowingly allow the 7 October attack to happen to “give them the green light to do whatever they bloody want”.  He apologised and called his comments “deeply offensive, ignorant and false”, but the party withdrew its support on 12 February. Labour, which has held Rochdale as a safe seat since 2010, hopes enough of its supporters still voted for the party to block a Galloway victory, with Ali still appearing on the ballot. But the bookies suggest Galloway is in prime position to win the seat. He has previously won seats from Labour in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012. The Liberal Democrats and Conservative party are not expected to pose a serious threat. Simon Danczuk, who was Rochdale’s Labour MP from 2010 to 2017, stood in this byelection for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Nigel Farage. Guy Otten, who was standing for the Green party, decided to pull out of the race for the seat over Islamophobic tweets. A Green party spokesperson said: “As nominations have now closed, his name will still appear on the ballot. However, he will not take part in any campaigning between now and polling day.”"

        "content": "  5.33pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Jeremy Hunt is considering scrapping Britain’s non-domiciled tax rules in next week’s budget, it has been reported, in a move that would see him poach one of Labour’s key fiscal policies. It has been reported that the chancellor is also considering lifting a second Labour tax plan, and extending the scope of the windfall tax on energy companies. (See 2.46pm.)   The number of visas issued to allow social care workers into the UK reached record levels in 2023, according to newly released figures.   Michael Gove, the housing secretary, has been placed under investigation by parliament’s standards watchdog after notifying them that he failed to declare hospitality at a football match with a Tory donor.   Sarah Everard’s family have said she was kidnapped and murdered by Wayne Couzens because he was armed with police powers he should never have had, after an official report revealed new and damning failures by police who missed his prolific sexual offending dating back almost 20 years.   The Labour MP Jess Phillips has said she is “tired that women’s safety matters so much less” than small boats in parliament, as she read a list of women killed by men over the past 12 months to a near-empty chamber.   Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister, has said the UK should rejoin the single market. He has also said the government should not cut taxes in next week’s budget, but increase defence spending instead. This is from the broadcaster Andrew Neil, who interviewed him today.   Interviewed John Major at the Global Soft Power Summit in Westminster today. Three interesting news lines: 1. He is against the UAE or any other foreign governments from taking over the Telegraph and/or Spectator. 2.

He thinks we should rejoin the single market and that Britain…— Andrew Neil (@afneil) February 29, 2024   Updated at 5.34pm GMT    5.23pm GMT   Diana Johnson, chairwoman of the Commons home affairs committee, has criticised the manner in which the Home Office published the 13 reports from David Neal, the former independent chief inspector of borders and immigration. She said:  Not only have all these reports been published in one go, but there is no ICIBI (independent chief inspector of borders and immigration) in post to provide a press release or a commentary on the contents of these reports. This is wholly inadequate and raises serious questions about what the Home Office has been doing all this time.      5.16pm GMT  Schools in England told by DfE they should not let pupils miss class to attend protests  Schools in England have been told they cannot grant absences for pupils to attend protests, according to new guidance issued by the Department for Education that comes into force next summer. The guidance, published today, details new measures including raising fines on parents for unauthorised absences of five days or more. But it also includes a new prohibition on schools giving students leave to attend protests.“Leave of absence should not be granted for a pupil to take part in protest activity during school hours,” the guidance states. The move comes after a series of school strikes over climate change gained in popularity in 2019, and more recently over the Israel-Gaza conflict.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the new guidance was “unhelpful” for head teachers. Barton added:  The pupils involved in protests feel very strongly indeed about the cause over which they are protesting, and that this can be a very difficult and sensitive situation to manage. As such, we feel that these are matters that are best left to the discretion of schools.      5.12pm GMT  Sunak's focus on clearing 'legacy' asylum backlog led to poor decisions and 'perverse outcomes', watchdog says  Rishi Sunak’s focus on clearing the “legacy'” backlog for asylum applications led to bad decisions and “perverse” outcomes, David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said. In a report based on an inspection of casework between June and September 2023, he said:  I am concerned that the focus on clearing the legacy backlog ‘at all costs’ has led to perverse outcomes for claimants and staff. The number of claims that have been withdrawn and counted as ‘outcomes’ has soared – 22% of all decisions made since June 2022 were withdrawals, and, incredibly, only one underwent formal quality assurance. This is not acceptable. Routine quality assurance on interviews and decisions has also been sacrificed for increased productivity. This has the potential to add to the appeals queue as a result of poor-quality refusals, and to further prolong the length of time a claimant’s life is put on hold.      5.03pm GMT  13 reports from borders and immigration watchdog that were held back finally published by Home Office  The Home Office has published 13 reports from David Neal, the former independent chief inspector of borders and immigration. They are all available here. Neal complained the Home Office had been sitting on them and delaying publication, and he was recently sacked after he started leaking what they said to journalists.     4.58pm GMT  Grant to Jewish security charity announced by Sunak broke normal value-for-money rules, Home Office reveals  The Home Office has revealed that a four-year grant for a Jewish security charity announced by the PM was allowed even though it broke normal value-for-money rules. In a speech last night to the Community Security Trust (CST), which provides security for Jewish schools and synagogues, praised the work it does and announced a long-term funding package for it. In October the government gave it an extra £3m, taking its total government support to £18m for this financial year.  Sunak said that, because “CST is going to be needed for many years to come”, he was changing the way it was funded and promising it at least £18m a year for the next four years. To approve this Sir Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, required “ministerial direction” – a rare process where a civil service accounting officer only allows something to go ahead on written instructions because it contervenes the normal spending rules. In his letter to James Cleverly, the home secretary, explaining this, Rycroft said that that spending the money on protecting Jewish communities were justified – but that other security providers should have been allowed to bid for the work. He said:  Regarding value for money, the grant standard is clear that government grants should be subject to competition by default. It is well established that competition unlocks savings and improves performance by encouraging applicants to compete against each other for the available funding. To meet the propriety and value for money tests, and to avoid the need for a ministerial direction, I proposed that we could commit to JCPSG [Jewish community protective security grant] funding for four years but limit the direct award to CST to one further year and agree to use that period to run a competition for subsequent years. This approach would have both provided reassurance to the Jewish community and ensured that we meet the standards set out in MPM [managing public money]. You decided against this approach.      4.32pm GMT  60% of voters say it's time for change of government, poll suggests  YouGov has published a new report on the state of public opinion. In his write-up, Matthew Smith summarises the findings like this:  The public say it’s time for change, and prefer Labour to the Conservatives, but expectations of the party are low.  This sentence probably understates how good the overall numbers are for Labour, even though it captures the impression given by the figures that people aren’t expecting wonders from a Labour government. One of the most telling findings is that 60% of people say it is time for a change. Here are three of the most illuminating charts.

As PA Media reports, Slave Play at the Noel Coward Theatre, which features Game Of Thrones star Kit Harington among the cast, will have two performances aimed at an “all-black-identifying audience” that is “free from the white gaze”. Organisers of Black Out shows say they do not “prevent or preclude anyone” from attending and “nobody” has been turned away in the past. Asked about the proposal, the PM’s spokesperson told reporters:  The prime minister is a big supporter of the arts and he believes that the arts should be inclusive and open to everyone, particularly where those arts venues are in receipt of public funding. Obviously, these reports are concerning and further information is being sought. But clearly, restricting audiences on the basis of race would be wrong and divisive.      3.12pm GMT   The former cabinet minister Sajid Javid played a key role in persuading Rishi Sunak to remove the Tory whip from Lee Anderson, the former Tory chancellor George Osborne has claimed. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with Ed Balls, Osborne said:  I think Sajid Javid plays the kind of unsung hero role in all this … He, as I understand it, did phone Downing Street and said ‘this is completely unacceptable and it’s not enough for this guy [Anderson] to apologise … You know, he’s got to go.’  Osborne also claimed there was “friction” between No 10 and the Treasury ahead of the budget. He said:  There’s certainly been friction between No 10 and No 11 –and it’s pretty obvious the No 10 would like to cut income tax now. That, specifically, is something that Rishi Sunak promised when he was running to be the Tory leader …  I think No 10 was interested in cuts in the headline rate of income tax. And the problem that they’ve not been able to get around is the fact that this is regarded as inflationary by the Office for Budget Responsibility. So in other words, if you cut income tax, you put inflation up. And if you think of the central mission of the Sunak government, it has been to get inflation down. And this has been the source of a lot of conflict and debate and arguments.       2.46pm GMT  Jeremy Hunt reportedly now considering lifting two of Labour's four revenue-raising tax plans  The BBC and some other news organisations are reporting that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is considering raising revenue by scrapping non-dom status in next week’s budget. Labour is committed to the policy, which could raise up to £3.6bn, and ministers have always attacked the idea on the grounds that it would discourage wealthy investors from coming to the UK. But Hunt is desperate to find anything that might allow him to cut taxes for ordinary workers (a reduction in national insurance seems to be his preferred option), and this would help with that. It would hobble Labour, which wants to use money from the removal of non-dom status to fund an expansion of the NHS workforce. ITV’s Robert Peston has posted a useful analysis on X. Now Alex Wickham from Bloomberg reports that another proposed Labour tax increase, widening the scope of the windfall tax on energy companies, is also being considered by Hunt.

They are: the extended windfall tax, closing a tax loophole used by private equity (carried interest), getting rid of non-dom status, and VAT on private school fees. Hunt now seems interested in lifting two of these proposals.  Updated at 2.53pm GMT    2.24pm GMT       1.54pm GMT  Humza Yousaf says he's 'very open' to calls for inquiry into police failings in Iain Packer case  FMQs at Holyrood was dominated by calls across the chamber for a judge-led public inquiry into manifold police failings in the Ian Packers case. Packers was jailed for 36 years yesterday after he was found guilty of murdering Emma Caldwell in 2005 and a catalogue of sexual violence against 22 other women. Both Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who described the case as “one of Scotland’s worst policing scandals”, and Scottish Labour’s Anas Sarwar used their questions to demand an inquiry. Both also stressed that such an inquiry should be led by a judge from outside Scotland. Humza Yousaf, the first minister, agreed there was a “strong argument” for this and said he was “very open” to calls for an inquiry. He will meet Caldwell’s mother Margaret in the coming days. Sarwar also highlighted “the wider culture within Scottish institutions where they fight to protect their reputations rather than protect victims” - noting recent reports into racism and misogyny in Police Scotland. Ross also raised the “utterly shocking” surveillance of journalists and a police whistleblower after the Sunday Mail named Packer as the likely killer in 2015.     1.51pm GMT  Home Office set to publish 13 reports from borders and immigration watchdog that were being held back  The Home Office is due to publish 13 of the 15 outstanding reports submitted by sacked borders and immigration watchdog David Neal on this afternoon, PA News reports. During his tenure, Neal had repeatedly raised concerns that the department was too slow to publish his reports. UPDATE: Lizzie Dearden from has a list of the reports we are expecting.

At the morning lobby briefing, asked what evidence there was about a public consensus on mob rule, the PM’s spokesperson slightly avoided the question, pointing to incidents such as MPs being threatened and meetings being disrupted. Pressed on whether the public believed these amounted to mob rule, he said such events were intimidating politicians and “impacting the way in which the democratic process is being carried out”. Asked if a country being under mob rule meant Sunak believed there had been a failure of political leadership, the spokesperson replied: “I don’t think he would accept that characterisation.” He also declined to blame the police, saying they had “done an excellent job and are working tirelessly to keep the public safe”.  Updated at 3.28pm GMT    1.29pm GMT   Unlock Democracy, which campaigns for democratic reform, says the Michael Gove story failing to declare VIP hospitality at a football match shows why MPs should not accept any “freebies”. This is from Tom Brake, the former Lib Dem MP who heads the organisation.  The simplest solution to MPs suffering from freebie ‘oversight’ would be to ban them from accepting freebies in the first place. There is no such thing as a free lunch, and free tickets to football matches, concerts, or race courses come with expectations from the companies donating them.      1.25pm GMT   A reader asks this, prompted by the Rishi Sunak quote in the post at 9.57am.  I don’t understand Sunak’s reference to “Iranian generals”. Have they been joining protest marches too?!  Sunak seemed to be referring to reports about an online video shown to a meeting organised by the Islamic Students Associations of Britain. From the reports of this incident that I’ve read, no university seems to have been involved.     1.17pm GMT   Dan Jarvis, the shadow security minister, replied to Tugendhat. He welcomed the announcement about security spending, but said the minister in his statement had not considered the roots of this “poison”. He said it was hard not to see a connection between the polarised debate online and the greater threat of harm MPs now face. And he challenged Tugendhat to say when the government would publish a definition of hateful extremism. That would be helpful he said. In response, Tugendhat said work on the updated definition was underway, but he could not say when it would be ready. Neither Jarvis nor Tugendhat mentioned Rishi Sunak’s claim that “mob rule is replacing democratic rule”.     1.08pm GMT  Security minister Tom Tugendhat says government committed to ensuring MPs can serve without fear  In the Commons Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, is making a statement about the security of MPs. He says the house brings the nation together. MPs come from all parts of the UK to debate, and to decide laws. All voices should be represented, he says. Democracy only works if people can choose who they want, and if those MPs can say what they think. But in recent days those principles have wavered. He says MPs have told him they feel they have to vote a certain way because “a threatening few” have put them in fear for their safety, and the safety of their families. The Commons has even been pressured into changing the way it debates, he says, referring to the way the speaker ignored procedural rules in the Gaza debate last week. Tugendhat says the demontrators said last week they wanted parliament to lock its doors. That was a threat to democratic values, he says. He says incidents of antisemitism are on the rise.  All voices should be heard, he says. And MPs should be able to serve without fear. That is why the government has committed £31m to protect them. Tugendhat says the PM held a meeting with senior police officers. The police have agreed a new defending democracy protocol, he says.     12.57pm GMT  Penny Mordaunt commends Lee Anderson for article in which he suggests his use of word 'Islamist' problematic  Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has commended Lee Anderson for a lengthy newspaper article he has written in which he suggested that his use of the word “Islamist” was problematic. Anderson did not apologise in his Daily Express article for what he said last week about Sadiq Khan, but he went further than he has done before in accepting that his use of language caused offence. Mordaunt said this was the closest he might get to an apology. In a GB News interview last week Anderson said:  I don’t actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they’ve got control of [Sadiq] Khan, and they’ve got control of London.  After Anderson refused to apologise, he was suspended from the Conservative party. Asked to explain what was wrong with Anderson’s remark, No 10 said on Tuesday that it was wrong to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism. In his Express article Anderson said:  The point I was trying to make last week was that the mayor of London has lost control of our capital city as the extremists who hide under the Islam banner take over our streets in their attempt to change the course of our democracy. These extremists are often labelled as Islamists which, on reflection, is totally unfair on Muslims in general and we must make sure that our language reflects this. These extremists are not welcomed by our Muslim friends as they cast a dark shadow on the millions of decent Muslims in our country who have embraced our way of life. To be clear when I call out these extremists, I am calling out a minute percentage of a group of people and because of this I have been called racist and Islamophobic … I do not believe the mayor is an Islamist, I just think he does not care about our beautiful city and people in high places should have more sense than to make these outrageous claims that I am racist or Islamophobic.  During business questions Lucy Powell, the shadow leader of the Commons, asked Mordaunt if she thought Anderson’s original comments were racist or Islamophobic. Mordaunt replied:  I know that she will want to hear one word from the honourable member for Ashfield, but yesterday he did provide us with 1,000. I read his piece in the Express and it is some distance from the view that he expressed in that interview, and I think that what he wrote in the Express is his genuine view. Those thousand words, we might have to accept, are the closest we will get to a one-word apology that others seek.  Referring to suggestions that Anderons may join Reform UK, Mordaunt said:  I would rather ask [Anderson], whatever political hue he ends up being, to consider all the good he could do in these particular times with the trust and following that he built up.      12.18pm GMT  Yvette Cooper dismisses government's response to murder of Sarah Everard as 'too little, too late'  Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was responding to Cleverly and she told him that his response was “too weak”, that the government was doing “too little, too late” and that the lack of urgency shown by the Home Office was “unfathomable” She said she was “sick and tired of nothing changing”. People should not have to wait any longer, she said. She said Labour wanted the government to introduce a mandatory framework for police vetting. In response to Cleverly’s announcement that with certain offences, officers would be automatically suspended when charged (see 12.07pm), she said that was not enough. With these offences, officers should be suspended earlier. She said she could not see why the government was not committing today to accepting the Angiolini recommendations. As an example, she cited recommendation six – that all allegations about indecent exposure or other sexual offences against serving officers – should be now be reviewed. The first three recommendations cover indent exposure, and Cooper said the Home Office should be able to accept them immediately too. She said the murder of Sarah Everard should have been a watershed. But it wasn’t, she suggested. And she urged Cleverly to accept Labour’s proposal for a “Raneem’s law”.     12.07pm GMT  Cleverly says findings of report into Wayne Couzens 'appalling' and promises prompt response to recommendations  In the Commons James Cleverly, the home secretary, is now making a statement about the report by Dame Elish Angiolini into the murder of Sarah Everard by Wayne Couzens. The report was published earlier this morning. Vikram Dodd has a report on what it says here.   Related: Police should never have employed Wayne Couzens, report finds   And the full report is here. The report only covers part one of the inquiry, and it focuses on how Couzens was ablet to become and remain a police officer, and how red flags that should have shown how dangerous he was were missed. Cleverly says:  Tragically the report identifies that Couzens was completely unsuitable to serve as a police officer and, worse still, there were multiple occasions where this should, could have been recognised. Lady Elish found significant and repeated problems in recruitment and vetting throughout Couzens’ career, including overlooking his chaotic financial situation. This meant he was able to serve in a range of privileged roles, including as a firearms officer. It is appalling that reports of indecent exposure by Couzens were not taken sufficiently seriously by the police and that officers were not adequately trained, equipped or motivated to properly investigate those allegations. Had fuller inquiries been made in 2015 and 2020, Couzens could, perhaps probably would, have been removed from policing. Evidence of his preference for extreme and violent pornography and alleged sexual offending date back nearly 20 years prior to Sarah Everard’s murder. And the inquiry found Couzens was adept at hiding his grossly offensive behaviour from most of his colleagues, but that he shared his vile and misogynistic views on a WhatsApp group. The other members of that group are no longer serving officers after a range of disciplinary processes.  Cleverly says the report makes 16 recommendations. The government will carefully consider them and respond in due course. The response will be prompt, he says. But he says the government has already taken steps to improve vetting for police officers. He says funding has been provided to ensure that police get intelligence more quickly about potential problems with officers, the rules have been changed to ensure officers can be dismissed more easily, and police chiefs have been put back in charge of chairing misconduct panels. He says there will be a new presumption that officers found to have committed gross misconduct will be sacked. And he says he can announce today that for certain offences there will be an automatic suspension when people are charged. He says the Everard murder started a national conversation about violence towards women and girls. He says they routinely feel unsafe. That is unacceptable, and change is needed, he says. He says this has been made a priority – meaning it should be as important for the police as terrorism.     11.44am GMT  Labour claims Home Office asylum figures show Sunak has 'lost control of immigration system'  The Home Office has released a raft of data relating to asylum, immigration and small boats. The Labour party has been going through the figures and it claims the picture they present is damning. Here are some of the findings it is highlighting.  Only 2% of people who have arrived in the UK in small boats since 2018 have been returned, the figures show. That amounts to 2,580 people being returned, of whom 1,889 were returned last year.   Almost 130,000 people are waiting for an asylum decision, the figures show. (See 10.18am.) Here is the table with the table with the figures.   There are 45,768 asylum seekers in hotel accommodation, the figures show. Labour says Rishi Sunak is committed to ending the use of hotel accommodation. Here is the table with these figures.   Almost 20,000 asylum seekers seem to have disappeared into the system, because their applications are marked as “implicitly withdrawn”, the figures suggest.   More than 600,000 work visas were issued in 2023, the figures show. Labour says this is because of skill shortages in the UK.  Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said:  These damning statistics show how Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have lost control of our immigration system and our border security - and have no plan to turn it around. A year after promising to end their use, almost 46,000 people are still stuck in hotels. The Tories’ failure to clear the backlog and return small boats arrivals has blown a £4bn hole in the Home Office budget, paid at taxpayers’ expense. Meanwhile, work visas are soaring due to their failure to train people here in the UK.      11.18am GMT   The Conservative peer and former MP Stewart Jackson has also made the point about Rishi Sunak’s comments yesterday echoing what Suella Braverman has been saying. (See 9.25am.) He suggests Sunak is a weathercock, “buffeted by events”.  Rishi Sunak is now saying what #SuellaBraverman rightly said four months ago, and for which she was sacked. Tony Benn astutely divided politicians as between signposts and weathercocks. One can think ahead, the other is buffeted by events. We know which one is which, don’t we?

We know which one is which, don't we?— Stewart Jackson 🇮🇱🇬🇧🇺🇦 (@BrexitStewart) February 29, 2024   Updated at 11.37am GMT    11.07am GMT   In his speech to the Community Security Trust last night (see 9.57am) Rishi Sunak said that, in addition to increasing government funding for the CST by £3m to £18m for this financial year, and promising £18m for next year, he could announce that it would be getting £18m a year for the next four years. In response today the Board of Deputies of British Jews said:  We commend the prime minister on his powerful speech at the CST dinner last night, pledging more funding to protect the Jewish community, outlining a new protocol to safeguard our elected representatives and effectively police protests, and drawing a clear line between democratic dissent and mob intimidation. The last few months have seen an extreme rise in antisemitic hate in the UK, which has had a significant effect on British Jews. The prime minister’s announcement has made it clear - those bringing chaos to our streets and academic institutions will no longer be allowed to act with impunity.      10.55am GMT  Parliamentary commissioner for standards says Gove being investigated - after revelation about omission from register  Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, is has been placed under investigation by Parliament’s standards watchdog, PA Media reports.  The probe relates to Gove’s register of financial interests, according to the standards commissioner’s website. The website does not give any more detail about the complain and details of investigations by the commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, are kept confidential until the inquiry is concluded. Those under investigation are barred from discussing the allegations. But the Guardian last week reported that Gove failed to register VIP hospitality he enjoyed at a football match with a Conservative donor whose firm he had recommended for multimillion-pound personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Here is the Guardian’s story.

PA says:  According to new figures from the Home Office, the total is also down 27% from the 175,457 people waiting for a decision at the end of June 2023, which was the highest figure since current records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 83,254 at the end of December, down 24% year-on-year from 109,641, and also 41% down from the record 139,961 at the end of June 2023. There were 3,902 asylum applications in the legacy backlog that were still awaiting an initial decision at the end of December 2023, updated Home Office figures show. Asylum applications made before June 28 2022 are counted as legacy cases. The government had pledged to clear the legacy backlog by the end of 2023. This backlog had stood at 98,659 applications at the end of June 2022. One asylum application does not always equal one individual, as an application can cover a group of people.

In it he elaborated on what he sees as the threat to democracy posed by pro-Palestinian activism. The full text is here on the No 10 website, but here are the key points.  Sunak said MPs were facing increasing intimidation and that he was not willing to accept this. He said:   As prime minister, I’m not prepared to stand by, and watch MPs forced out of public service because of fears for their safety. Nor I am prepared to allow this pattern of increasingly violent and intimidatory behaviour seemingly intended to shout down elected representatives and hijack the democratic process through force itself. It is as un-British as it is undemocratic. And it cannot stand … We will never give in to the threats of violent extremists. We will not be cowed into changing the way our parliamentary democracy operates. We will do whatever it takes to defend our democratic processes just as we will do whatever it takes to keep you safe.    He said he wanted to end “passive tolerance of words and actions that go against what we stand for”. He said:   It’s not enough merely to strengthen our physical security we must also be far bolder and more assertive in defending our British values. We’ve got to end this passive tolerance of words and actions that go against what we stand for. Yes, you can march and protest with passion; you can demand the protection of civilian life but no, you cannot call for Jihad there is no “context” in which its acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes onto Big Ben and there’s no cause you can use to justify the support of proscribed terrorist groups, like Hamas. And yes, you can freely criticise the actions of this government, the Israeli government or indeed any government. But no, you cannot use that as an excuse to call for the eradication of a state – or any kind of hatred or antisemitism. These statements are fundamental to the liberal democratic values that define Britain. They are the very essence of our identity of who we are as a country. To belong here is to believe these things; to stand up for these things. And it’s time we were much, much clearer about this.  Sunak seemed to be referring to the sort of words or behaviour covered by the legislation covering “glorifying” terrorism, but he did not show much allowance for the argument that “tolerance” of words and action you disagree with is also a fundamental liberal, democratic value.  He called for a tougher approach to tackling antisemitism in universities. He said:   What is happening right now on campuses is simply not acceptable. Jewish students are being targeted, threatened, and assaulted simply for being Jewish. The chaplain at the University of Leeds having to take his family into hiding after death threats because he’s an IDF reservist. Iranian generals – let me say that again – Iranian generals - giving antisemitic speeches as people abuse the right to freedom of speech as a cover for hate speech. This cannot go on. Where people break the law on our campuses they will be met with the full consequences. And where they create a culture of intimidation we will hold the university leadership to account. University leaders must take personal responsibility for protecting Jewish students in their institutions.      9.35am GMT   Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police, told the Today programme this morning that Rishi Sunak’s comments about “mob rule” (see 9.25am) were unhelpful. As HuffPost UK reports, Babu said:  Language is important. I don’t think that kind of language is helpful … My daughters have been on marches, ordinary people, Jewish people, Muslim people, people of no faith, LGBTQ people, have all been on marches. So this is a wide spectrum of people, so to call these people a mob is not very helpful, particularly when you’re trying to appeal to them to stop marching.      9.25am GMT  Rishi Sunak accused of ‘hysterical nonsense’ after claiming ‘mob rule is replacing democratic rule’  Good morning. When Rishi Sunak (eventually) decided to take action against Lee Anderson after he claimed that the city of London, and Sadiq Khan, its mayor, were under the control of Islamists, people asked why he was not prepared to discpline, or even criticise, the former home secretary Suella Braverman, who had said something even stronger. “The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now,” she said in a Telegraph article. It was assumed that Sunak did not want to pick a fight with her because she has too much support within the party. Now it seems there is another explanation: Sunak did not criticise Braverman because he broadly agrees with her. That is the implication of a No 10 briefing last night, which included this quote from what Sunak told a policing roundtable earlier in the afternoon. He said:  There is a growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule. And we’ve got to collectively, all of us, change that urgently. We can make a start today with the new Democratic Policing Protocol … We simply cannot allow this pattern of increasingly violent and intimidatory behaviour which is, as far as anyone can see, intended to shout down free debate and stop elected representatives doing their job. That is simply undemocratic. So it’s right that the protocol commits to additional patrols, provides clarity that protests at elected representatives’ homes should be treated as intimidatory. And we’ve provided additional funding for protective security. But we also need to demonstrate more broadly to the public that you will use the powers you already have, the laws that you have.  Campaigners and MPs have dismissed the claim that “mob rule is replacing democratic rule” as hypberbolic, alarmist and illiberal – and, frankly, just wrong. It is also an unusual electoral gambit, given that you might argue letting the country descend into “mob rule” would not reflect well on the political party in charge over the past 14 years. This is from Tom Southerden, law and human rights director at Amnesty International UK.  Talk of ‘mob rule’ wildly exaggerates the issue and risks delegitimising the rights of peaceful protest. Freedom of expression and assembly are absolutely fundamental rights in any free and fair society. The UK has undergone a major crackdown on protest rights in recent years, with peaceful protest tactics being criminalised and the police being given sweeping powers to prevent protests taking place.  This is from the SNP MP John Nicholson.  Beyond startling. Hysterical, fear mongering nonsense. There is no \"mob rule\" in England. Unless one regards the Tory Party as an unruly mob.

        "content": "The United Kingdom, February 2024. A cold wind blew down Whitehall. The streets were nearly empty. The shops boarded up. Just a few veiled women, keeping their heads bowed as they hurried home. Inside 10 Downing Street, the prime minister cowered under his desk. “No more,” he sobbed. Over in City Hall, Sadiq Khan signed the death warrants of another 50 motorists who had failed to pay the Ulez charge. His original order had been that first offenders should only have both hands cut off, but he had been overruled by the ayatollahs. Sharia law should never be that lenient. In Threadneedle Street, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, was pacing the vast boardroom. The woman he was expecting, the editor of the Financial Times, was late. On the table were laid out two bandanas and two suicide vests. In under an hour they – and Jeremy Hunt – would both be dead. Well, what would you do? After all that Jezza has done to the economy. The fight back of the deep state starts here. Still, the caliphate was expanding its reach. Down in the Cotswolds, Boris Johnson was being dragged through the centre of Chipping Norton. In an hour’s time he would be stoned to death. The punishment for adultery. Let him be an example to other politicians. Up in the balcony of the town hall, David Cameron – AKA Lord Big Dave – allowed himself a wry smile. He would be throwing the first stone. Er … actually, scrub that intro. That was the Lee Anderson and Liz Truss vision of Britain on Monday. It’s now Thursday. The United Kingdom, February 2024. A cold wind still blew down Whitehall. The streets were also still empty and the shops boarded up. And Rishi Sunak hadn’t moved since Monday. Nobody had managed to talk him out from under his desk.  Out on Oxford Street, a group of murderous terrorists had formed an orderly queue outside Selfridges. They claimed to be waiting for the shop to open so that they could buy the new Call of Duty video game. But Rish! knew better. He alone had attended the Cobra briefing led by Suella Braverman. Before long, some of the terrorists would be waving flags and walking somewhere else. Some might even be smiling and demanding “peace”. Imagine that. It was the same throughout the rest of this once prosperous land. In the countryside, sheep were lying with donkeys and crops were rotting in the fields. The roads were unpassable, blocked by overturned cars and looted lorries. The sun no longer shone and beggars howled to the skies, their cries unanswered. Bodies lay unburied in the street. And still the mob demanded peace. James Cleverly was just the latest cabinet member to tiptoe into No 10 via the secret tunnel. It was far too dangerous for him to use the front door. He kept his head down in the corridors in case his movements attracted the attention of a sniper. He needed to coax the prime minister out. He hadn’t been to the toilet for days. “What do you want?” Rish! sobbed. “Leave me alone! Leave me alone!” “It’s OK,” said Jimmy Dimly tenderly. “Is it safe? Is it safe?” “Is what safe?” “Is it safe? Is it safe? The country has descended into mob rule. We no longer have a functioning government. By the way, who is the prime minister? And which party has been in power for the last 14 years?” “You don’t want to know,” said Jimmy D. “But I have a cunning plan. We’re going to let everyone have three protests and then say: ‘You’ve made your point. Enough is enough. Time to go home now and everything will be fine.’” “You say all the sweetest things, Jimmy,” said Rish!. “I don’t know where I’d be without you.” Weirdly, this wasn’t a line of reasoning that the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, chose to employ in his statement to the Commons on MPs’ safety. In fact, he got through the whole hour without mentioning the words “mob rule”. Almost as if he was a bit ashamed by his leader. Embarrassed by him. You get the feeling that the end of this parliament can’t come too soon for Tories like Tugendhat. Instead, Tugendhat just stuck to basics. MPs are increasingly under threat and need protection. No one was going to argue with that. Though he was understandably unwilling to think what might have prompted the surge in death threats. That it might have all kicked off with the coarsening of the debate during the Brexit years. Rightwing newspapers branding MPs and judges as traitors and enemies of the people. And the government just standing by in passive acceptance. Nodding it through. Back in Downing Street, Jimmy D was still trying to lure Sunak out. “It’s the big annual Tory fundraiser tonight. The Black and White ball,” Dimly explained. “We need to extract as much dosh as possible with the election coming.” “What have others given so far?” squeaked Rish!. “Let me see … Suella has offered a lifelong break in Rwanda. Stay in a two-star hotel. The advance bidding on that has been slow. And Honest Bob Jenrick is offering to help with controversial planning applications. Pornographers especially welcome …” “And what are you giving?’ “A luxury five-night stay on the Bibby Stockholm, with a banquet dinner cooked by 30p Lee.” “That’s amazing.” “In which case I will offer an honorary knighthood. Preferably to someone linked to my father-in-law’s business interests.” “You’re all heart,” said Jimmy Dimly. “All this giving is very tiring.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-29T15:34:00+00:00",
        "content": "With less than a week to the budget, the chancellor is mulling whether to poach one of Labour’s headline policies and scrap non-dom status, which gives generous tax breaks to some of the UK’s wealthiest residents. Who would actually be affected, and what would happen if he went ahead? Who are the non-doms? Being “non-dom” means living in the UK but claiming that your permanent home (“domicile”) is abroad. Non-doms can live in the UK all year round, and may already have lived in the UK for several years. What matters for their tax is that they claim they plan to move to a different country eventually. All sorts of people might be non-dom according to this definition: foreign students living in the UK for a few years, au pairs spending time learning English, the stereotypical “Polish plumber” with a family back home that they intend to return to. What makes non-dom status so controversial is that it comes with the ability to claim a special tax privilege: unlike the rest of us, non-doms don’t have to pay tax on investments they have abroad. When Labour or the government claim they are “abolishing non-dom status”, it is actually this tax break they are promising to get rid of. Unlike the earlier examples, the people who benefit from this tax break are a very selected bunch. Three in 10 people with incomes over £5m make use of non-dom status, compared with only three in 1,000 people with incomes below £100,000. Many of them work in finance, so that one in five of the highest earning bankers have at some point claimed non-dom status. In the richly paid oil industry, two out of five have benefited. The tax break is also used by top film stars and sports people. One in six of this group, with an average income of £2m each, have used non-dom status to reduce their tax bills. Should the regime be scrapped? There are a number of arguments made for why the non-dom tax break should be ended. First, because the tax break is specifically for investments made abroad, it actually discourages wealthy people from investing in the UK. This is the opposite of what the UK needs, even more so in a recession. Second, the tax break only goes to those who are intending to leave, or at least who make this claim. This discourages top talent from coming to the UK and settling here, since they lose eligibility. Third, it seems unfair that while most UK residents pay tax on their incomes, whether made in the UK or abroad, non-doms get a special deal. That unfairness is made more stark by the fact that non-doms using the tax break are already very well-off. Finally, at a time when public services are being squeezed, abolition of the tax break could raise much-needed revenue. How much would be raised by abolition? The best estimate of how much would be raised by complete abolition of the tax break in 2024 is £3.8bn, according to our calculations for the CAGE research centre at the University of Warwick. This is even after accounting for the fact that abolition would lead non-doms to change their behaviour in various ways to reduce their tax bills. However, there are reasons we still might want some transitional arrangement in place. A new arrival from, say, Germany, might a couple of years later want to sell their German house and settle down permanently in the UK. It would be hard to justify why the UK should apply capital gains tax to that house for the full 30 years she has owned it, rather than the two years she has spent in the UK. We might therefore want some arrangement that allows new arrivals to reorganise their affairs to reflect their new life in the UK. Any arrangement should be strictly time-limited, but it would naturally reduce some of the revenue that was raised. A regime that provided an exemption for the first two years could still raise £3.2bn. Would the high earners leave? We can learn about this from our past experience. The UK actually added restrictions to the regime in 2017. For those that were affected this reduced their post-tax incomes by almost a fifth, so if everyone was going to flee, this would have been the time to do it. What we saw was that a few people did leave, but the numbers were relatively small. In any given year, about 5% of people affected by the reform would be expected to leave anyway, because this group is pretty mobile. The reform increased this to 10%. A natural concern is that even this small rate of leaving could cost serious money. For the leavers, we not only miss out on the new tax we wanted, we also lose the tax they were already paying. However, the striking thing about the people who left in response to the tax reform is that they were the ones who were paying the least tax anyway, so it actually doesn’t cost much to lose them. The vast majority of non-doms are actually in the UK to work, and are making very high incomes, be that as bankers, footballers or CEOs. These jobs pay a lot in the UK, more than they would get elsewhere, and so for most non-doms it isn’t financially sensible for these people to leave. Leaving also means they would miss out on the UK’s “vibrant economic climate” and cultural scene, which many of them value.

        "published_date": "2024-02-29T13:46:21+00:00",
        "content": "The former cabinet minister David Davis has asked for the National Crime Agency to consider the past business dealings of the Conservative donor Mohamed Amersi, saying in parliament that the businessman “facilitated corrupt deals”. Davis made a string of serious allegations about Amersi under parliamentary privilege, saying the businessman and philanthropist had misused the legal system to pursue a defamation case against Charlotte Leslie, a former Tory MP. The case against Leslie failed last year. He accused Amersi of having bullied Leslie and of having been behind lies that she sexually blackmailed men, physical intimidation and threatening letters sent by the law firm Carter-Ruck to journalists and MPs. Davis said it appeared to him to amount to “criminal harassment” and said he would send a copy of his parliamentary speech to the Metropolitan police for them to consider whether it was. The Conservative MP for Haltemprice and Howden said it was “for the appropriate legal bodies to come to a decision on his innocence or guilt”. Amersi denied the corruption allegations, saying they were made up and he had never been found to have engaged in any wrongdoing. He called the claims about Leslie “unhinged and utterly wrong”, saying he was in fact the subject of a “well orchestrated bullying, harassment and intimidation campaign by Leslie and her media and political cabal”. Davis made the claims in parliament after the publication of a book by the Guardian journalist Tom Burgis. After the speech, Amersi tweeted: “David Davis made another misinformed rant against me in favour of Leslie and to promote Burgis’s book. For the record I repeat what I had previously said: 1. By using parliamentary privilege, Davis has bullied and lied about the true facts. If he has any substantive proof about what he alleges, please say it to me outside. Do not be a coward; 2. Every deal undertaken had magic circle advisers and blue chip banks; 3. I deny in the strongest terms any and all allegations; and 4. All the deals have been the subject of review by various enforcement agencies around the world and no wrongdoing on my part was established.” Speaking during an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Davis outlined his views on Amersi’s role as an adviser on telecoms industry deals in Russia, Uzbekistan, Nepal and Kazakhstan. He said Amersi was an adviser in 2005 in a deal in Russia along with a lawyer and businessman who is said to have been a front for Leonid Reiman, a Vladimir Putin ally and former Russian telecoms minister. The lawyer has previously denied this. Davis said: “It seems likely that Amersi’s payment for the deal – $4m – came from the proceeds of crime against the Russian people, funnelled via [the lawyer].” Davis also said Amersi was involved in a deal struck by a Swedish telecoms company, TeliaSonera, in Uzbekistan that later “led to a finding of criminal activity”, as Telia had agreed to buy a stake in a company controlled by the Uzbek president’s daughter for a hugely inflated price in order to gain access to the Uzbek market. The MP said that company and its Uzbek subsidiary later admitted it had paid more than $331m in bribes to an Uzbek official. “That is corruption 101: paying a bribe by vastly overpaying in a business deal that ultimately profits members of a corrupt regime,” he said. “The American Department of Justice confirmed that TeliaSonera ‘corruptly built a lucrative telecommunications business in Uzbekistan, using bribe payments wired around the world through accounts in New York City’.” Amersi said the deal, for which he was paid £500,000 for advising on the valuation and structure, had been examined by four enforcement agencies and no wrongdoing by him had been found. The Conservative MP said that thanks to Leslie and the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, as well as “the relentless work of journalists such as Tom Burgis, upon whose new book Cuckooland I will draw today, we know that Amersi was deeply immersed in a twilight world of backroom bribes, creative accountancy and a whole lot of smoke and mirrors.” Amersi responded that this was “a figment of his imagination, rejected and denied in its entirety”. He said the claim that he was paid £19,000 a day to advise TeliaSonera was a “made-up sensational number”. He said every deal he worked on had world-class lawyers and bankers involved, and he was only an adviser, while deals had to be approved by a deal team, management, board and in some instances shareholders. Davis also outlined his concerns about a deal advised on by Amersi for TeliaSonera in Kazakhstan, where he said Amersi “facilitated a large, questionable business deal to the benefit of a banker accused of being a front for the corrupt Kazakh regime”. He raised further concerns about a deal that he said Amersi helped to facilitate in Nepal. The businessman responded later that he had “no idea what [Davis] was talking about”. The politician said Amersi’s dealings “in the former Soviet Union and Nepal are therefore surely a matter for the National Crime Agency to consider”. Amersi has given more than £500,000 to the Conservatives and some of its politicians since 2018. Davis did not directly criticise the Conservatives but said all parties had been too ready to accept money from wealthy people. Amersi says he has helped charities, academic institutions and donated to the Tories “with no quid pro quo”.   Related: ‘Can I now send the funds?’: secrets of the Conservative money machine   Separately on Tuesday, Hodge wrote to the Electoral Commission and the Met calling for an investigation into questions related to a £200,000 political donation that Amersi’s long-term partner, Nadia Rodicheva, made to the Conservative party in 2017. A book by Burgis reported that the donation was initially going to come from Amersi himself. However, at that time he was deemed an “impermissible donor” because he was not on the electoral roll. Correspondence shows Tory party officials suggesting to Amersi that the donation should instead “please come from Nadia’s account”. The Conservative party did not respond to questions about the donation but said it “only accepts donations from permissible sources”. Amersi said the donation was made from Rodicheva’s sole account after a “lengthy” process undertaken by the party to ensure that the donation was legally compliant. “As far as Ms Rodicheva and I are concerned, no rules were broken,” he said. Amersi said the party had direct communications with Rodicheva prior to receiving her donation. He added: “It is for the Conservative party to answer what checks were made.”"

        "content": "Michael Gove, the housing secretary, has been placed under investigation by parliament’s standards watchdog after notifying them that he failed to declare hospitality at a football match with a Tory donor. The inquiry was revealed on Wednesday, with the standards commissioner saying it relates to Gove’s register of financial interests. The commissioner did not give further details but Gove last week said that he would notify the authorities about an “oversight” that meant he failed to make the required declaration about hospitality at a football match in 2021. The Guardian had reported that Gove failed to register hospitality he received alongside David Meller, a donor whose firm he had referred to the VIP lane for assessing PPE deals during the Covid pandemic. Meller’s firm, Meller Designs, won six PPE contracts worth £164m. Gove’s referral of Meller Designs was not yet public knowledge when in August 2021 Meller and his son, Jonny, accompanied Gove and his son to Queens Park Rangers’ first match of the football season, a 1-1 draw with Millwall. During that week Jonny Meller had contacted one of the QPR owners, Amit Bhatia, saying Gove had asked to be taken to the match. Jonny Meller inquired if they could pay to have seats in Bhatia’s box, explaining that it could be uncomfortable for Gove if they sat in a general area of the stadium due to public anger at the government’s handling of the pandemic. Bhatia made his box available, waiving any payment for it, and Gove and David Meller went to the match with their sons and some other guests. Gove’s spokesperson told the Guardian his failure to declare the two complimentary tickets he received was an “oversight”. The spokesperson said: “Mr Gove is grateful to the Guardian for bringing this matter to his attention. He has written to the relevant parliamentary authorities to inform them of a potential omission from the register of members’ financial interests regarding two complimentary tickets he received from Queens Park Rangers Football Club to a match in August 2021. “Mr Gove routinely declares his attendance at such events in his role as an MP and government minister, as evidenced by other entries in his register of interests and ministerial transparency returns. He apologises for any oversight on his part.” The MPs’ code of conduct requires them to register gifts, benefits and hospitality over a value of £300. The senior Tory is one of six MPs, all Conservatives, being investigated by the standards commissioner."

        "content": "Polls have opened in the Rochdale byelection after a chaotic contest dominated by the war in Gaza.\nThe veteran campaigner George Galloway is the bookies’ favourite to win after Labour abandoned its candidate over inflammatory comments he made about Israel.\nGalloway, the former Labour MP, has described the poll as “a referendum on Gaza” and sought to capture the votes of thousands of disaffected Muslims.\n\n Related: ‘We don’t deserve this’: Rochdale voters left cold by byelection chaos \n\nLabour had expected to increase its 9,668-vote majority in the Greater Manchester town until it emerged that its candidate, Azhar Ali, had repeated anti-Israel conspiracy theories about the 7 October attack by Hamas.\nAli will still be on the ballot paper – it was too late to select another candidate – but he will sit as an independent MP if he wins. The result is expected at around 3am on Friday.\nThe byelection was called after the death of Rochdale’s MP, Sir Tony Lloyd, from leukaemia on 17 January.\nLabour enjoys an average 20-point lead in the national opinion polls and was riding high on the success of the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections earlier this month, both of which it won from the Tories with double-digit swings.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBut what was expected to be a straightforward contest to replace Lloyd was thrown into disarray when Ali’s comments were published by the Mail on Sunday on 11 February. He had suggested Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat.\nLabour, which has held Rochdale since 2010, hopes that enough of its supporters will vote for the party on Thursday to stop Galloway, although byelections always have lower turnouts than nationwide polls.\nSir Keir Starmer’s party faces a challenge from another former Labour MP in the form of Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager.\nDanczuk was Rochdale’s MP from 2010 to 2017 and is standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party presided over by Nigel Farage.\nThe two other main parties, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, are not expected to mount a serious challenge, while Labour’s vote is expected to be split further between a handful of local independent candidates.\n Interactive\n\nGalloway, 69, is expected to be the main beneficiary of the chaos having campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket aimed at Rochdale’s Muslim community, which accounts for about 30% of the population.\nIt would be the third time the veteran agitator has unseated his former party after victories in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012.\nLike his previous campaigns, the Rochdale contest has been mired in controversy. Galloway last week said the names of Labour MPs were “dripping in blood” after the party’s ceasefire amendment, which did not go as far as some pro-Palestine supporters wanted.\nThe four-week contest has been mired in controversy. Earlier this week a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to Danczuk, who hired security guards for the final two days of campaigning.\nGalloway’s team said its banners and garden posts had been ripped down in an effort to stop it getting the word out."

        "published_date": "2024-02-28T23:07:06+00:00",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt is considering scrapping Britain’s non-domiciled tax rules in next week’s budget, it has been reported, in a move that would see him poach one of Labour’s key fiscal policies. The decision is understood to be on a list of revenue-generating options drawn up for the chancellor and Rishi Sunak after economic estimates left them with less money than expected for tax cuts or spending pledges. If it is announced in next week’s budget, the Conservatives would be mirroring a Labour policy that Hunt has previously criticised. Abolishing the non-dom tax regime would raise an estimated £3.6bn a year. Treasury sources told various newspapers on Wednesday that Hunt was mulling over scrapping or scaling back the tax break as among a range of last-minute options in the event that official forecasts deteriorated over the next few days and further hampered the prospect of budget tax cuts. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on budget speculation ahead of a fiscal event.” There were 68,800 non-doms in the UK in the tax year ending in 2022, according to HM Revenue and Customs.  Interactive  Under current rules, foreign domiciled nationals resident in Britain can earn money from capital abroad without paying UK tax on it for up to 15 years, provided they do not remit any income or capital gains back into the country. The rule has been used by Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, to save paying millions in UK tax. The Guardian reported last month that Labour’s plan to scrap non-dom tax breaks would allow a four-year grace period for those with the status. Research suggesting that scrapping the breaks could raise at least £3bn a year was cited by Labour when it announced the plans in 2022. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said abolishing the tax break in full would raise that amount each year and that Labour would use the money to expand the NHS workforce. However, the party is also considering new regimes for temporary residents. One option under consideration is for individuals to be able to live as non-domiciles in the UK for four years before they pay the full UK tax. In November, the chancellor suggested he did not know how much money scrapping the tax status would raise. At the time Hunt said he would rather the super-rich stayed “and spent their money here”, adding he had been told by Treasury officials that they were “very unsure” about how much money the move would actually make."

Starmer also said that Liz Truss, the former PM, should not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate again after she spent last week at a conference in the US with far-right Republicans denouncing the “deep state”. (See 1.39pm.)   Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has defended his decision to listen to the concerns of Tory MPs who want to water down the bill banning no-fault evictions. (See 5.06pm.)   More than half of Conservative party members believe Islam is a threat to the British way of life, according to a poll that sheds light on the hostility with which large parts of the party view the country’s second biggest religion.   The Palestine Solidarity Campaign has rejected a suggestion from James Cleverly, the home secretary, that it should halt its regular demonstrations about the war in Gaza. (See 1.50pm.) Cleverly has also suggested that protest laws could be tightened, requirig groups to increase the amount of notice they give to police before large demonstrations.   GB News has paid Conservative MPs more than £660,000 in appearance fees and salaries since it launched, against just £1,100 to Labour MPs, Guardian analysis shows.   Police forces will be forced to provide more protection to victims of domestic abuse under a Labour government, the party has said.   Fergus Ewing, one of the SNP leadership’s fiercest critics, has called on the party to change course and ditch its “dreadful” governing partnership with the Scottish Greens, as he lost his appeal against a week-long suspension from the Holyrood group.      5.31pm GMT  Starmer defends Rayner as Labour's deputy leader dismisses attacks on right-to-buy purchase as 'smears'  Labour said Keir Starmer has “full confidence” in his deputy, Angela Rayner, following questions over an ex-council house sale she made after benefiting from former prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s right-to-buy scheme, PA Media reports. PA says:  The Labour leader’s spokesperson batted away questions about the transaction during a briefing with reporters after PMQs. Asked whether Starmer had full confidence in Rayner, the spokesman replied: “Correct. We have full confidence in all of the answers that she has given on this.” Rayner, who is also the shadow housing secretary, has rejected claims in a book by Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman, due to be published in March. She has called the reports a “constant stream of smears” and denied she was liable for capital gains tax on the property sale, which was finalised before she was elected in 2015. Lord Ashcroft’s book alleges that the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne bought her former council house, in Stockport, Greater Manchester, with a 25% discount in 2007 under right-to-buy, a scheme introduced by former Tory PM Mrs Thatcher in 1980. Rayner, who has committed to reforming the scheme, which she says has “helped fuel the housing crisis” by depleting publicly-owned housing stock, is said to have made a £48,500 profit when selling the house eight years later. Those selling a right-to-buy home must wait five years before they can sell, or the seller has to pay back some or all of the discount they received. Tory MP Jacob Young has accused Ms Rayner of staggering “hypocrisy” for wanting to reform Thatcher’s flagship policy after “personally benefiting from the right-to-buy discount”. Rayner has said her proposed reforms, which she said will “review the unfair additional market discounts of up to 60% the Tories introduced in 2012”, are the “right thing to do”. There are also questions about whether the property she sold was her main residence. Government guidance says that a tenant can apply to buy their council home through the right-to-buy scheme if it is their “only or main home”. According to an article by the Mail On Sunday (MoS), which is serialising Lord Ashcroft’s book, documents indicate that Rayner was registered on the electoral roll at her former council house for five years after she married Mark Rayner in 2010. Her husband was listed at another address about a mile away, which had also been bought under the right-to-buy scheme. In the same year as her wedding, Rayner is said to have re-registered the births of her two youngest children, giving her address as where her husband resided. Under electoral rules, voters are expected to register at their permanent home address. There are penalties for providing false information when registering to vote. Rayner tweeted on Monday: “I bought my council house back in 2007. “I owned my own home, lived there, paid the bills there and was registered to vote there, prior to selling the house in 2015. All before I was an MP… “I’ve never been a ‘landlady’, owned a property portfolio or been a non-dom. “As with the majority of ordinary people who sell their own homes, I was not liable for capital gains tax because it was my home and the only one I owned. “My husband already owned his own home independently and I had an older child from a previous relationship.” She added: “For all the unhealthy interest taken in my family by Lord Ashcroft and his friends, there is no suggestion any rules have been broken. “Just a constant stream of smears from the usual suspects.”      5.06pm GMT  Gove defends landlords after campaigners criticise his proposals to water down bill banning no-fault evictions  Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has defended his decision to listen to the concerns of Tory MPs who want to water down the bill banning no-fault evictions. In a response to the BBC report saying the government has drafted amendments to address their concerns, he dismissed complaints that he was appeasing “landlord backbenchers”. (See 9.47am and 10.46am.) Gove told the Sun he knew landlords who were “thoughtful and serious people”. He went on:  The overwhelming majority of landlords do a great job. They they want to have a relationship with their tenant that goes beyond just cash. They wants to make sure that they’re providing a service that the tenant appreciates. So, of course I listen to landlords. We just want to make sure that this bill works for them as well because you need a healthy private rented sector.   Updated at 5.15pm GMT    4.44pm GMT  Who will win the Rochdale byelection?  A reader asks:  Any word on predictions for the Rochdale byelection tomorrow? I’ve seen Reform touring the constituency (I live here) in an open top bus, while Galloway has also stepped up his campaigning. We’re drowning in mailshots from the pair of them.  If you live in Rochdale you probably know better than I do, but my assumption (and the assumption of colleagues at Westminster) is that George Galloway will win quite easily. I don’t have any great insight into the contest, because I have not covered the campaign. But I have done a lot of byelection reporting in the past and I know that it helps a lot if you can turn a byelection into a referendum on a particular issue; if you are angry about X, vote Y. Galloway has done that; he has a message. He also seems to have an organisation campaigning on his behalf (an active bunch of supporters). He has got a track record of having won a byelection like this before. And, like him or loath him, he is a brilliant campaigner. Simon Danczuk is standing for Reform UK, but if he has a message, I haven’t picked it up. Reform UK has never come close to winning a byelection, and I have not seen any evidence to suggest that in Rochdale their campaigning machine has suddenly got a lot better. As the incumbent party candidate, even without Keir Starmer’s endorsement, Azhar Ali ought to be in with a chance. But all the reporting I’ve read suggests his campaign has collapsed, and low turn-out byelections depend a lot on who can motivate their supporters. On this measure, Galloway seems miles ahead. The bookies think the same. This is what Coral bookmakers sent me earlier today.  Leading bookmaker Coral makes the Workers Party (George Galloway) odds-on at 1-2 to win the Rochdale by-election, which takes place tomorrow.Labour, who currently hold the seat, are second best in the betting at 6-4, while the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK are 33-1.      4.09pm GMT  Labour says it would extend terms of office for head of armed forces and other military chiefs  John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, promised to extend the maximum tenure of the head of the armed forces and other military chiefs from three years to four on Wednesday but he avoided making any commitments on defence spending in the run up to the election. The Labour politician said in a speech he wanted to start “appointing service chiefs for four years, reviewed for performance after two” if his party won the election, although aides declined to clarify whether that would apply to current chief of defence staff Adm Sir Tony Radakin. Radakin became head of the military in November 2021, meaning a normal three year term would end around the time when prime minister Rishi Sunak is expected to call a general election, although it is possible he would remain in post longer to allow a new government to appoint his successor. Healey was also pressed to see if Labour would commit to increasing defence spending in the light of Russia’s attack on Ukraine and greater uncertainty in the Middle East, but gave no firm commitment to go beyond the existing Nato target of exceeding 2% of GDP. “Firm commitments on funding can’t simply be made in opposition. That’s the job for government,” Healey said. A Conservative pledge to lift defence spending to 2.5% when circumstances allow was first made by Boris Johnson in June 2022 “when interest rates were 1.25%” Healey said. Rates are now “5.25%, four times higher” and so the interest paid out by the Treasury was higher, impacting affordability, he added.

Rory Carroll has the story here.   Related: Amnesty clause for soldiers breaches human rights law, Belfast court rules       3.54pm GMT  Labour announces plan for 'Raneem's law' to get police to offer more help to victims of domestic abuse  Police forces will be forced to provide more protection to victims of domestic abuse under a new Labour government, the party has said. ‘Raneem’s law’, named after Raneem Oudeh, killed by her ex-partner alongside her mother Khaola in 2018, will force police to respond to reports of domestic violence more quickly and consider immediate use of orders to protect women. In a move widely welcomed by campaigners in the violence against women and girls sector, the new law would also see a dedicated police officer installed in every force to have oversight over all civil orders designed to protect women and girls against violence. The law will put domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms to make sure victims are responded to urgently, a policy already announced by the party following a successful pilot in Northumbria. It also seeks to address technology and communication failings which leave women at risk. Forces will also have to provide data on police applications for civil orders to the NPCC and Home Office, while Labour said it would also push forward the national roll-out of an electronic link between the family court and police forces so civil orders and injunctions are widely shared. Campaigners have long argued that orders designed to protect women from abuse – such domestic violence protection notices (DVPN) and domestic violence protection orders (DVPO) - are not used widely enough or are ineffective because breaches are not followed up. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the new law would mark a “step-change” in tackling violence against women and girls, which the party has pledged to halve within a decade. She said:  Missed opportunities cost lives and far too many have already been lost. We cannot stand by while more women, like Raneem and Khaola, are so badly failed by the system charged with keeping them safe.  Raneem Oudeh and her mother, Khaola Saleem, 49, were stabbed to death by Oudeh’s estranged husband, Janbaz Tarin, in August 2018, after he had subjected her to stalking, domestic violence and coercive control for more than a year. In 2022 an inquest found that failings by West Midlands police “materially contributed” to the deaths of the 22-year-old woman and her mother. It heard that Oudeh had made at least seven calls to the emergency services in the run-up to her death. On the night she and her mother were killed, they called 999 four times, but despite the fact that Raneem had a non-molestation order against her former partner, no officers were sent to her home.     3.20pm GMT   Chris Morris, chief executive of Full Fact, the fact-checking organisation, has criticised Rishi Sunak for failing to commit to PMQs to signing its honest campaigning pledge. (See 12.17pm.) The Green party, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP have signed. Morris said:  With public trust in politics at its lowest levels for 40 years, the chance to take a stand for honest campaigning was brushed off in parliament today.  Party leaders need to take a hard look at their duty to restore trust in our democracy. Full Fact wants to rebuild faith in politics - don’t they?      2.49pm GMT  Humza Yousaf welcomes analysis saying Scottish government policies will keep 100,000 children out of relative poverty  Humza Yousaf has published an analysis which estimates 100,000 children will be kept out of relative poverty in 2024-25 as a result of Scottish government policies. The first minister insisted that tackling poverty remains the “driving mission” of his government, despite ferocious criticism by homelessness and child poverty groups of yesterday’s Holyrood budget, which passed by MSPs yesterday. The SNP leader, who has faced growing criticism from council and opposition leaders over his surprise decision to freeze council tax rates after the party’s crushing defeat by Labour in October’s Rutherglen byelection, said he “understood [charities’] frustrations” but hoped that they appreciated the constraints on his budget. He suggested charities should also apply pressure to the incoming UK government. He said:  We will continue to take the actions as necessary within the powers that we have, but I would say to those charities … to equally exert pressure on the current and the incoming UK government to make the changes necessary to lift children out of poverty.  He suggested that a new Labour government could “at the drop of a hat” decide to scrap the two child limit and introduce an essentials guarantee to reform universal credit provision. Responding to the analysis, John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) in Scotland, said the projection made clear that the government’s existing policy package is insufficient to reach its own legally binding target of less than one in ten children living in poverty by 2030. He said:  That’s why it was so disappointing that the budget passed yesterday did nothing to build on current progress. There is far more the first minister can be doing with devolved powers – starting with delivering the increase to a £30 Scottish child payment that he himself said he wanted to see during his leadership campaign.      2.32pm GMT  More than half of Tory members in poll say Islam a threat to British way of life  More than half of Conservative party members believe Islam is a threat to the British way of life, according to a poll that sheds light on the hostility with which large parts of the party view the country’s second biggest religion. Kiran Stacey has the story.

PA says:  Protesters, who had travelled from across the country to attend the event, cheered, waved Welsh flags and held placards in Welsh and English reading: “No Farmers, No Food”. They are objecting to proposals by the Welsh Labour government to require more land to be set aside for environmental schemes. A series of protests have already taken place across Wales but the event in Cardiff Bay on Wednesday was the largest by far, attended by thousands of farmers. South Wales police had previously asked those attending not to bring tractors, meaning a line of the vehicles were parked along a road leading to Cardiff Bay. The event saw speeches from Senedd politicians from the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru, as well as from former international rugby union referee Nigel Owens. He told the cheering crowds: “In 2015, I was very privileged to referee the World Cup final in Twickenham – the proudest moment of my career. But today I’m even prouder to come and speak in front of good, decent people. An honour to be here to speak and to support you today as a fellow farmer.”      2.10pm GMT   During the urgent question in the Commons on the Post Office, despite criticising Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, for revealing confidential informaton about its chief executive, Nick Read, at a committee yesterday (see 2.01pm), Kevin Hollinrake did discuss Read’s attempts to get a pay rise. The Conservative MP Jane Stevenson asked:  In yesterday’s select committee, Mr Staunton spoke about lobbying for a pay rise for Mr Read, which I know must have been quite galling to many of those subpostmasters. The minister was reported as refusing this pay rise. Can I ask him what sort of pay rise Mr Staunton thought would be a fair, equitable agreement at that time?  And Hollinrake replied:  I think on two occasions Mr Staunton sought to lobby or did lobby for a pay increase for Mr Read. He sought to double the overall package of Mr Read on those occasions.  As PA Media reports, MPs could be heard saying '“wow” in response.     2.01pm GMT  Henry Staunton was 'highly unprofessional' in revealing Post Office chief executive under investigation, minister tells MPs  A government minister has criticised the former chair of the Post Office following his dramatic select committee evidence on Tuesday during which he revealed the company’s current chief executive is under investigation. In response to an urgent question in the Commons, Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, described yesterday’s revelations by Henry Staunton in front of the business select committee as “highly unprofessional” during an urgent question in the Commons.  Staunton revealed during his testimony that Nick Read, the chief executive of the Post Office, is currently under investigation - something Hollinrake said on Wednesday showed: “No one is untouchable and the Post Office culture is unchanging.” Staunton has been at the centre of a public row with the business secretary Kemi Badenoch over a series of allegations he has made about the government’s handling of the Post Office scandal, including his claim that a civil servant instructed him to slow down compensation payments to victims. Badenoch was not in the country on Wednesday to respond in the Commons however.     1.50pm GMT  Palestine Solidary Campaign rejects suggestion from Cleverly it should halt its regular protests  The Metropolitan Police has been accused of “politicised, heavy handed and violent” policing by the organisers of protests against Israel’s action in Gaza, who are to meet with Scotland Yard on Friday to hand over a dossier listing a series of complaintsA call by the home secretary, James Cleverly, to cease protesting and that they had “made their point” (see 11.19am) was also rejected by organisations including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) at a press conference inside parliament, which was told that any clampdown on protest was an attempt to insulate MPs from public opinion“We know the demonising of protest for Palestinian rights is driven by pro Israel actors, including within the establishment,” said Ben Jamal of the PSC, who said that the campaign did not support protests outside of MPs homes but backed demonstrations outside of surgeries and parliament.A dossier of complaints that will be handed by the PSC to the Met at a meeting on Friday accuses the force of “politicised policing” and of conducting a Twitter campaign against demonstrations using language that implies they are threatening or dangerous.The event was also address by the Labour MP, John McDonnell, who said any clamp downs on protest “chips away” at basic rights. “That sort of thing pushes people to the extremes rather than maintaining confidence in our democratic system,” he added.     1.39pm GMT  PMQs - snap verdict  Ahead of every general election in modern times it is usual for some commentators (or most of them, sometimes) to predict that this will be the ugliest, dirtiest contest ever. In historical terms, this is always wrong (18th an 19th century elections were a horrorshow compared to what is allowed now), but it it true that elections don’t bring out all that is best and noblest in politics, and today’s exchanges were muddier than a pig farm. Welcome to election 2024. Starmer devoted all his questions to the Conservative party’s tin-foil-hat tendency. His first question was beautfully crafted.  Tory MPs spent last week claiming that Britain was being run by a shadowy cabal made up of activists, the deep state and, most chillingly of all, the Financial Times. At what point did his party give up on governing and become the political wing of the flat earth society?  He then attacked Liz Truss, who was elected PM by Conservative party members less than two years ago and who last week was in America spouting extremist deep state conspiracy theories that would have disbarred her from even being allowed on the CCHQ candidates list a decade ago.  [Truss] predecessor spent last week in America trying to flog her new book. In search of fame and wealth, she’s taken to slagging off … [As Tories heckled] They made her prime minister, now they can’t bear talking about her. In search of fame and wealth, she’s taken to slagging off Britain at every opportunity. She claimed that as prime minister she was sabotaged by the deep state. She also remained silent as Tommy Robinson, that right-wing thug, was described as a hero. Why is he allowing her to stand as a Tory MP at the next election?  Starmer challenged Sunak to say that he did not want Nigel Farage back in the Conservative party. (Sunak dodged the question.) And Starmer concluded:  The truth is these are no longer the Tories your parents voted for and the public can see it. The prime minister has lost control of his party to the hordes of malcontents, the tin-foil-hat brigade over there, the extremists who wrecked the economy, all lining up to undermine him, humiliate him and eventually to get rid of him. When will he ever stand up to them, and end the pathetic spectacle of a Tory party that used to try and beat Nigel Farage now giving up and dancing to his tune instead?  The slow transformation of the Conservatives from a mainstream, centre-right party into something more populist, Trumpian and far-right is one of the most interesting developments of our time, and it was good to see Rishi Sunak challenged on this ground. Voters increasingly see the party as extreme, and Starmer was reinforcing that. But, in chosing go “go low”, he authorised Sunak to do the same, and the prime minister hit back ferociously – and at times effectively. Sunak’s strongest line probably came when he used the Farage queston to shoehorn in a spiel about the Conservative party and diversity.  In our party we have a proud tradition of diversity and accepting everyone from every background, it is a proud record that puts Labour to shame. This is the party that delivered the first Jewish prime minister, the first female prime minister, the first black chancellor, the first Muslim home secretary and is now led by the first British-Asian prime minister. While it seems he can only champion men from north London, it’s the Conservatives who represent modern Britain.  On Lee Anderson, Sunak claimed, falsely, that he had suspended him immediately (he waited 24 hours), but it took Labour even longer to disown Azhar Ali in Rochdale and so this comeback has some force.   When [Starmer] learnt of vile, antisemitic remarks made by a Labour candidate, what did he do? He instructed his team to defend him, he sent a shadow cabinet minister to campaign for him and he personally backed him for days, and that’s the difference between us. I act on my principles, he hasn’t got any.  And Sunak ended claiming that over the Gaza vote last week Starmer wanted to “bend to mob rule”, an argument widely accepted by Conservative MPs who think that voting arrangements should not have been decided by the desire not to provoke people who threaten parliamentarians. Sunak has been constantly on the back foot at PMQs recently, but today at least he put up a fight. Tory MPs seem impressed. The lesson, perhaps, is that in a mud-slinging match, no one comes out clean. Perhaps Starmer would have been better off devoting one or two questions to Tory cranks, and then pivoting to policy, where he almost always wins quite easily these day. My colleague John Crace thinks Sunak is actually much happier with a PMQs dominated by low insults (despite everying thinking Sunak was a sensible policy person when he became PM) because he has nothing to say on policy. John’s got a point. The government is so short of ideas that the main business in parliament this afternoon is a bill regulating pedicabs in central London.

Is he happy with what she has been saying? Sunak says Badenoch has defended her handling of Post Office matters, and he says her account was backed up by some of those giving evidence to the business committee yesterday.      12.36pm GMT   Anna McMorrin (Lab) asks Sunak why he posed for photographs with a group that shares extremist views on climate change and net zero. That is a reference to Helena Horton’s story.   Related: Sunak stands with net zero and climate conspiracy group at farming protest   Sunak says that is no way to talk about Welsh farmers.     12.34pm GMT   Sarah Owen (Lab) says the UK has had seven consecutive quarters of no growth. This recession has Sunak’s name all over it. Sunak says Owen should check her facts.  (It is seven consecutive quarters with no growth in GDP per capita, not overall GDP. Owen’s question was ambiguous as to what measure she was referencing.)     12.29pm GMT  Sunak declines to express confidence in Post Office chief executive Nick Read  Kevan Jones (Lab) asks about the revelaton that Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, is being investigated over an 80-page complaint. Does the government have confidence in him? Sunak says it would be inappropriate to comment on an inquiry until it is over. He says the legislation about exonerating post officer operators will be published shortly.     12.25pm GMT   Daniel Kawczynski (Con) says Shropshire council is struggling to deal with rising adult social care costs.  Sunak say the government provided an extra £600m for councils.      12.24pm GMT   Diana Johnson (Lab) says 80 victims of the contaminated blood scandal have died since the inquiry recommendations were published last April. Why has the government not implemented those? Sunak says he is acutely aware of the strength of feeling on this. The government will speed up its response to the inquiry, he says.     12.22pm GMT   Alexander Stafford (Con) asks Sunak to help him end the war against cars in his constituency. Sunak says Rotherham council has had extra funding for road safety measures.     12.21pm GMT   Tulip Siddiq (Lab) asks if parents will actually be able to access the new childcare offer promised last year. Sunak claims the government is delivering on this. He says Wales has had the funding to deliver this in Wales. But they have pocketed the money, instead of matching what is on offer in England.     12.20pm GMT   Philip Dunne (Con) asks about the designation of new bathing water sites. Sunak says the government is consulting on creating new bathing water sites, and says this should be welcome.     12.19pm GMT   Alyn Smith (SNP) says last week the house united behind a call for a ceasefire in Gaza. But Sunak refused to commit to pushing this postion at the UN in his answer to Stephen Flynn. He says this suggests that there is no point to parliament. Sunak says calling for a ceasefire that would collapse is not in anyone’s interests.     12.17pm GMT  Sunak refuses to commit to Tories signing up to honest election campaigning pledge  Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru, says her party has signed the Full Fact pledge for honest campaigning at the election. But there is evidence that the Tories in Wales are not campaigning honestly. Will the PM sign this pledge? Sunak says he was in Wales last week, and the NHS there is performing worst than anywhere else in the UK. And farmers are being decimated. He says the Tories will continue to point that out.     12.14pm GMT   Jamie Wallis (Con) asks about the case for licensing AI. Sunak says Wallis can meet with a minister to discuss this.     12.14pm GMT   Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the horror of the situation demands the Commons has a say. And it should demand an immediate ceasefire. Does the PM share President Biden’s confidence that this could happen from Monday. Sunak says there has been progress, and the government is urging all sides to seize the opportunity. Flynn says we are almost five months from the start of this conflict. On three occasions the UK has abstained at the UN when it could have voted for a ceasefire. If it comes to the UN again, will the UK vote for a ceasefire. Sunak says the UK supports the US’s draft motion at the UN. But a ceasefire that simply collapsed would not be worth having.     12.11pm GMT   Starmer says the Tories used to try to fight Nigel Farage. Now they embrace him, he says. Sunak accuses Starmer of bending to mob rule in the debate on Gaza last week. The Tories will stand up for British values, he says.     12.09pm GMT   Starmer asks Sunak if Farage fits with Tory values. Sunak says in Rochdale there are three ex-Labour candidates, two of them are antisemites. He claims the Tories throw out antisemites, while Labour makes them candidates.     12.08pm GMT   Starmer asks if Sunak agrees with Truss that Nigel Farage should be allowed back into the Conservative party. Sunak says the Conservative party has embraced diversity. It has had female leaders, and now the first British Asian PM. But all Labour leaders come from north London, he says.     12.06pm GMT   Starmer renews his attack on Truss. Sunak claims that he suspended Lee Anderson immediately, unlike Starmer with his candidate in Rochdale.  Updated at 12.07pm GMT    12.06pm GMT  Starmer says Sunak should ban Liz Truss from standing as Tory candidate because of her extremism  Starmer asks directly about Liz Truss, saying she has been running down Britain in the US to promote her book. And she seemed to back Tommy Robinson. Why won’t Sunak withdraw the whip from her? Sunak says no one in the Commons backs Tommy Robinson. He claims that Starmer did not act when Labour had an antisemitism problem under Jeremy Corbyn. Unlike others in the party, Starmer was too “spineless, hopeless, utterly shameless” to do anything about it. UPDATE: Starmer said:  [Truss] predecessor spent last week in America trying to flog her new book. In search of fame and wealth, she’s taken to slagging off … [As Tories heckled] They made her prime minister, now they can’t bear talking about her. In search of fame and wealth, she’s taken to slagging off Britain at every opportunity. She claimed that as prime minister she was sabotaged by the deep state. She also remained silent as Tommy Robinson, that rightwing thug, was described as a hero. Why is he allowing her to stand as a Tory MP at the next election?  And Sunak replied:  I don’t believe a single member of this house supports Tommy Robinson. But if he wants to talk about former leaders and predecessors, the whole country knows his record because he sat there while antisemitism ran rife in his party and not once but twice backed a man who called Hamas friends.   Updated at 2.25pm GMT    12.03pm GMT  Starmer says Tories have become 'political wing of flat-earth society' because they're promoting conspiracy theories  Keir Starmer says Tory MPs spent last week claiming the country was being run by a shadowy cabal, including the Financial Times. When did his party become “the political wing of the flat-earth society”. Sunak says Starmer is just sniping from the sidelines.     12.01pm GMT   Giles Watling (Con) says MPs should be able to speak and vote without intimidation, before going on to ask about dental services in Clacton.

Lee Anderson has arrived for #PMQs and has sat comfortably on the Tory benches, next to Andrea Jenkyns. It’s like his loss of the Tory whip was a Dallas plot twist-like shower dream.— Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) February 28, 2024   Lee Anderson has arrived for #PMQs and has sat comfortably on the Tory benches, next to Andrea Jenkyns. It’s like his loss of the Tory whip was a Dallas plot twist-like shower dream.  This is not unusual. Other former Tories now technically sitting as independents sit on the government benches.     11.54am GMT       11.49am GMT  Rishi Sunak to face Keir Starmer at PMQs  PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question.     11.27am GMT   Michelle O’Neill has continued her outreach to unionists by standing for God Save the King during a Northern Ireland football match at Windsor Park. The Sinn Féin first minister set a marker on Tuesday night by paying respect to an anthem, a team and a stadium that nationalists traditionally shun. O’Neill beamed during the Uefa women’s nations league clash between Northern Ireland and Montenegro, which ended 1-1, and said it was a “thoroughly enjoyable” experience. When O’Neill became the first nationalist first minister on 3 February she promised to represent all Northern Ireland, a state Sinn Féin in theory wishes to abolish. A Sinn Féin sports minister, Carál Ní Chuilín, set the precedent by attending a Northern Ireland game at Windsor Park in 2011 but skipped the anthem. O’Neill, in contrast, stood for God Save the King – for republican purists a recognition of British sovereignty in the region - and applauded at the end. She was accompanied by a Sinn Féin junior minister, Aisling Reilly, and the deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The DUP politician made her own symbolic journey last weekend by attending Ireland’s Six Nations rugby match against Wales in Dublin.     11.19am GMT  Home Office considering tightening restrictions on protests  James Cleverly, the home secretary, is considering further tightening the law around demonstrations, including a requirement for protesters to increase the amount of notice they give police before large demonstrations, Aletha Adu reports.   Related: UK home secretary may tighten restrictions on protests       11.10am GMT  Two thirds of councils expect to cut services to residents because of funding pressures, LGA says  Two thirds of councils in England say they will have to cut services to residents this year, despite the government providing them with an extra £600m in January, the Local Government Association has said. In a report giving the results of a survey of councils carried out after the extra funding was announced, the LGA says:  Two-thirds (67 per cent) of respondents anticipated making cost savings in at least one neighbourhood service, despite the additional funding: more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of social care councils reported this, as well as three in five district councils (59 per cent). [Neighbourhood services means things like “waste services, road and pavement repairs, sport and leisure services, parks and green spaces, library services, museums, galleries, and theatres”, the LGA says.] Of the respondent social care councils, three-quarters (75 per cent) reported that even with this funding, cost savings would be needed in their adult social care budget, and almost seven in 10 (69 per cent) reported that savings would be needed in their children’s social care budget. Half (50 per cent) of all respondent social care councils reported that cost savings would be needed in four or more neighbourhood services.   In a statement Shaun Davies, chair of the LGA, said:  Extra government funding will help councils this year, but acute funding pressures remain and are forcing many councils to make stark choices about what popular services to cut.  This will not go unnoticed by our local communities. It means less potholes filled, more streetlights dimmed or turned off, and fewer library or leisure services.      10.54am GMT   The government has not denied the BBC story about ministers drawing up amendments that would weaken the renters (reform) bill. (See 9.47am.) Asked to comment, the Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communites said:  Our landmark renters (reform) bill will deliver a fairer private rented sector for both tenants and landlords. It will abolish section 21 evictions – giving people more security in their homes and empowering them to challenge poor practices. We continue to meet regularly with a range of groups, representing all those in the private rented sector.      10.51am GMT   This is from the housing charity Shelter on the news that the government is considering watering down the renters (reform) bill.  📢 Watering down the #RentersReformBill will make a mockery of the government's promise to renters.Every day, our phonelines take calls from families needing new laws to protect them from homelessness. ❌ Not a new system that's the same or even worse than the current one. https://t.co/rfj6LHc2cn— Shelter (@Shelter) February 28, 2024   📢 Watering down the #RentersReformBill will make a mockery of the government’s promise to renters.Every day, our phonelines take calls from families needing new laws to protect them from homelessness.❌ Not a new system that’s the same or even worse than the current one.      10.46am GMT   Labour is now challenging Rishi Sunak to give an assurance that he won’t let Tory backbenchers with a vested interest water down the renters (reform) bill. (See 9.47am.) The party is highlighting research showing that almost a third of Conservative MPs who have signed amendments to the bill that would weaken protections for renters are landlords themselves. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader and shadow housing secretary, said:  Rishi Sunak must give cast-iron public assurances that he won’t give-in to vested interests on his backbenches and rip up his promises to renters. This ban was promised five years ago, but renters are still being failed by this government. As always with this prime minister, it’s party first, country second.      10.38am GMT  Ex-Post Office chair Henry Staunton genuinely believed he had been told to slow compensation payments, Byrne says  In an interview with Times Radio this morning Liam Byrne also said that, based on the evidence he heard yesterday, he thinks Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, genuinely believed that he had been told by the permanent secretary at the business department at the time, Sarah Munby, to slow down compensation payments. Referring to Staunton’s evidence on this, Byrne said:  I believe that he believed that [that Munby wanted him to go slow on compensation payments]. I’ve been a minister. I know how it all works. I suspect that he went to a meeting with the senior civil servant, and the conversation was in kind of civil service language, with a nod and a wink. And the point is that Henry Staunton left that meeting with ambiguity in his mind. And on something like this, there’s no room for ambiguity. You need very, very clear instruction to deliver with deadlines and targets and incentives for actually delivering on time. And so none of that we found evidence for none of that.  MPs are normally inclined to accept that people giving evidence to committees are telling the truth, but the Department for Business and Trade has strongly rejected Staunton’s account of his conversation with Munby, and Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, has accused him of lying.     10.37am GMT  Liam Byrne says he's 'horrified' ministers have not instructed Post Office to speed up compensation payments  Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, has said that he was “horrified” to learn yesterday that ministers have not formally instructed the Post Office to speed up compensation payments to victims of the Horizon scandal. He posted these messages on X about his committee’s marathon evidence session on this topic, which was covered extensively on yesterday’s live blog.  1/.

Updated at 10.39am GMT    9.47am GMT  Labour accuses Sunak of betraying renters after it emerges bill to ban no-fault evictions could be watered down  Rishi Sunak has been accused of betraying renters after it emerged the government is planning to water down long-awaited legislation that would ban no-fault evictions. The Conservatives promised to outlaw no-fault evictions and a bill that would do this, the renters (reform) bill, was published in May last year. But the bill has still not cleared the Commons. It was stalled for months, carried over into the current session of parliament and given a second reading in November. The government has still not announced when the final Commons debates will take place, although Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has promised that it will become law before the election. Ministers have been dragging their feet because the bill as it stands is unpopular with a cohort of Tory MPs, and today Harry Farley from the BBC is reporting that Gove is consulting them on compromise amendments that he is offering to get the bill through parliament. The BBC says:  The draft government amendments include putting it in law that the ban on no-fault evictions could not be implemented until an assessment of its impact on the courts had been published by the Justice Secretary. It comes after MPs on the housing select committee last year warned that abolishing no-fault evictions would lead to increased pressure on the courts, because landlords will have to give a reason to remove a tenant, such as rent arrears or antisocial behaviour … The government is also promising to review the system by which councils can regulate landlords and enforce standards, known as selective licensing. In the documents circulated to potential rebel Tory MPs, the government promised to announce a review of the scheme “with the explicit aim of reducing burdens on landlords”. Among the other draft amendments the government is suggesting: -Requiring renters to live in a property for a minimum of four months before they can give notice to end their tenancy -Allow “hearsay” evidence in eviction claims for antisocial behaviour  Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader and shadow housing secretary, said:  This is yet another betrayal of renters by the Conservatives, and yet another example of Rishi Sunak’s weakness which means he always puts party before country. Having broken the justice system, the Tories are now using their own failure to break their promises to renters in the most underhand way. The government must give a statement to Parliament today. Fourteen years of Tory failure have failed renters. Labour will ban no fault evictions, no ifs no buts.  Campaigners have also denounced the move. Tom Darling, campaign manager for the Renters’ Reform Coalition, said:  It is scandalous and farcical that the government are now outsourcing the writing of the renters (reform) bill to their landlord backbenchers. It reeks of desperation. They don’t know want to be seen to have reneged on their promise to deliver a better deal for renters, but with the ban on section 21 even further into the long grass, and the suggestion they are looking to ‘lower the burden on landlords’ to provide safe housing, England’s 11 million private renters will struggle to come to any other conclusion. In reality, the government’s initial proposals are the baseline of the change we need to the private rented sector. To actually fix the crisis in private renting we need a bill with longer tenancies, more time for renters to find a new home when evictions do happen, higher penalties for unscrupulous landlords, and a cap on rent increases to prevent unaffordable rent hikes becoming, in effect, no-fault evictions.  And Ben Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, said:  Weakening licensing schemes could compromise the safety of renters. These schemes give councils some of the strongest powers to tackle criminal landlords and sub-standard, dangerous homes .. We have waited a very long time for this Bill, but it must genuinely offer to improve renters’ lives if it is to be worth the paper it’s written on.   Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.28am GMT   Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, has welcomed today’s announcement about extra security for MPs. (See 9.13am.) He said:  I warmly welcome the government’s announcement of additional funding to protect our elected representatives and our democracy. It will enable us to build on the improvements we have made over the past two years, working with the police and Home Office to enhance security at MPs’ homes and offices, and crucially when they are out and about meeting their constituents.  I am particularly pleased that this funding will make it possible for all MPs - and in the forthcoming election period, all candidates - to have a dedicated police contact to liaise with on security issues.      9.13am GMT  Home Office announces £31m package of measures to protect MPs facing threats  Good morning. A week after Sir Lindsay Hoyle up-ended Commons procedural rules in the Gaza debate, partly because he had been persuaded that not allowing a vote on the Labour amendment would increase the risk to MPs having to vote on the SNP’s motion but not theirs, the government has announced a significant package of measures to improve parliamentarians’ security. The details don’t seem to be on the Home Office’s website yet, but PA Media has a good summary.  Security measures for MPs will be bolstered with a £31m package that will include providing elected politicians with a dedicated police contact to liaise with over safety issues. James Cleverly, the home secretary, who made the funding announcement, will meet with police chiefs on Wednesday to discuss what more can be done to improve the safety of MPs. He said no MP should have to accept that threats or harassment is “part of the job”. The extra funding follows fears about MPs being targeted and intimidated by demonstrators in recent months, particularly by those demanding action to bring an end to the fighting in the Israel-Hamas war. Conservative backbencher Tobias Ellwood’s home was targeted earlier this month by pro-Palestine protesters, with the police warning his family to “stay away” from the property as “arriving through that crowd would’ve antagonised the situation”. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have also had their family homes set upon by environmental protesters in past months. The Home Office said the latest funding package will provide increased security provisions for MPs. The investment will be used to enhance police capabilities, increase private sector security provisions for those facing a higher risk and to expand cyber security advice to locally elected representatives. It will also ensure all elected representatives and candidates have a dedicated named police contact to liaise with on security matters, officials said. Cleverly’s department said the measures would significantly expand the support provided under current policing arrangements for politicians. The home secretary will hold a roundtable with the National Police Chiefs’ Council today to discuss efforts to “protect democratic processes from intimidation, disruption or subversion”, his aides said. The announcement includes the establishment of a communities fund to support the deployment of additional police patrols each week in England and Wales to help deal with “increased community tensions”, the Home Office said. It is designed to increase support available to vulnerable communities, increase police visibility and boost public confidence, the department added. Two serving MPs — Labour’s Jo Cox and Conservative Sir David Amess — have been murdered in the past eight years, with reforms to the security of parliamentarians having been introduced as a result of those killings. Changes have included improvements to existing security measures at MPs’ homes and offices, and the bringing in additional private sector-delivered protective security where necessary.  Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Huw Merriman, the rail minister, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee. 10.30am: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, holds a press conference on poverty. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: Farmers are staging a protest outside the Senedd in Cardiff against the Welsh government’s sustainable farming plans. 1pm: John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank.

        "content": "At times like these we need the mind of Sherlock Holmes. “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.” So we’re left with a crime scene for which the only explanation is that half the Tories must suffer from arrested development. Maybe they all fell on their heads at the same tea party while they were overdosing on sugar. Because this week’s prime minister’s questions turned into a total embarrassment. One that was cheered on by frontbenchers such as Johnny Mercer and Jeremy Hunt, who are too half-witted to understand what they are watching. The Tory party has been unravelling for a while now. Arguably since 2010. But there’s no denying that the pace has ramped up significantly in recent months. Now it’s almost impossible to keep up. We seem to get through three or four news cycles between breakfast and lunch. If you stop paying attention for more than an hour, you are hopelessly lost. No chance of catching up. The world becomes a mystery. Try making sense of the appearance of Lee Anderson in the chamber. You might have been under the impression that 30p Lee had been suspended from the party. Persona non grata. Though what for is another question. You’ll find any number of ministers saying what he did was wrong. Totally unacceptable. Yet they become confused when asked to explain the nature of the wrong. “Er … I don’t know. It’s just … wrong.” But Anderson walked into the Commons without a care in the world. All smiles, backslapping his mates. Before heading straight back to his normal place between Andrea Jenkyns and Dean Russell. They could not have looked more pleased, either. Thrilled – honoured, even – that their old mucker had come to join them. Other Tory MPs soon gathered round to celebrate the return of the prodigal son. A man more sinned against than sinning. Suspended on a Saturday and welcomed back on Wednesday. Just like it never happened. If only the same could be said of PMQs itself. This was one for the masochists. An existential tour de farce that meant nothing. Just 30 minutes of mindless posturing. Exchanges that were cheered noisily but meant nothing. The speaker is badly damaged after last week’s Gaza debate – before, he would have at least tried to keep order; now he lets MPs do as they please. At the heart of government there is only a vacuum into which any form of intelligent life has long since been sucked in. Keir Starmer went in on the attack. Highlighting how far the Tory party has veered to the right. How many of its traditional supporters would now find it impossible to vote for Rishi Sunak’s rabble. He talked of how the Tories were living in a fantasy world. One where the country was controlled by a shadowy “deep state” run by the Bank of England and the Financial Times. Where all the major cities were under sharia law. Where public stonings were a daily occurrence. Where Tommy Robinson was hailed as a hero in the presence of Liz Truss, with no response. Yet another action with no comeback. “You’re spineless, hopeless and utterly shameless,” yelled Rish!, a paragon of confected rage. Everything about Sunak is artifice because he doesn’t really believe in anything any more. He did once believe in himself. What self-respecting techbro, Master of the Universe, wouldn’t? Only everything around him has turned to shit. There’s nothing left he can do to persuade people to back him. He’s a pointless, empty vessel. One of the few members of the cabinet self-aware enough to experience the pain of his own futility. To know that everything he does is wrong. But the Tory MPs loved it. This was the first time they had seen any sign of life from their leader in months. Normally he just flatlines his way through PMQs. Now at least there was some fight. Though they were way too dim to realise that all the movement was the last throes of a fish out of water. Worst still, the Conservative party is dying with him. Sunak is no longer a leader. He’s given up trying to give his MPs direction. Now he’s just a follower, going in whatever direction he is taken. A ship without a sail. MPs like 30p Lee and Radon Liz call the shots now. That’s why no Tory dares to mention the words Islamophobia or racism. The Tories are in danger of being institutionally blind to their Islamophobia. Lee’s words have become acceptable. So now we entered a shouting contest. Your party is racist, said Starmer. No, you’re the racist, squealed Rish!, as they were surrounded by mindless noise. Anyone who dared point out that the emperor had no clothes was dismissed as a woke virtue signaller. Yet every time Sunak spoke he merely emphasised the unbearable lightness of his being. Too detached from reality – a parliamentary helium balloon – to realise that every criticism he made of Starmer was better aimed at himself. The mirror was playing tricks with his reality. It was his reflection that he saw all along. The man he really hated was staring back at him. The accusations were threadbare. A surrealist fantasy. Starmer was too weak to throw Jeremy Corbyn out the party even though he had suspended him years ago. The three ex-Labour members standing in Rochdale? All signs of racism in the Labour party. Even though none were now backed by Labour. And what of Sunak’s own record? He had happily served in a corrupt government under Boris Johnson. The party he belongs to has been accused of covering up complaints of sexual assault by its own MPs. But hey! That’s just Rish! – a man who likes to do the right thing. Sunak looked thrilled with himself. He imagined himself to be a macho competitor. But the public just saw him as what he is. Tetchy, thin-skinned and whiny. Anything but a statesman. Weirdly though, this was him at his best. This is how Rish! wants to be seen in the run-up to the election. He knows he doesn’t have a record to defend. The economy is in recession. Debt is rising. There will be no miracle in next week’s budget. There is no substance to Sunak. So far better to fight imaginary culture wars. Tear down a world that doesn’t exist. Embrace the racism that dare not speak its name. In the meantime, at future PMQs, Starmer may be better off engaging with reality."

        "content": "One of the SNP leadership’s fiercest critics has called on the party to change course and ditch its “dreadful” governing partnership with the Scottish Greens, as he lost his appeal against a week-long suspension from the Holyrood group. Fergus Ewing, one of the party’s longest-serving MSPs, a former minister and son of the SNP icon Winnie Ewing, faced disciplinary action after he voted against the government on a no-confidence motion against the Green minister Lorna Slater brought by the Scottish Tories, prompted by her handling of the deposit return scheme. The SNP’s Holyrood group voted to take action against the Inverness and Nairn MSP last September by 48 votes to nine with four abstentions but Ewing appealed, arguing that this was a conscience vote and that he was representing his constituents’ concerns about the “abject failure” of the scheme. His appeal failed and on Tuesday his suspension – the first sanction of its kind used by the SNP at Holyrood – was confirmed. Ewing immediately released a statement describing the SNP as “authoritarian”, with a leadership that “no longer tolerates a conscience vote”. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday morning, Ewing called for the party to “go back to the middle ground, to be a broad church representing everybody in Scotland, accepting that people can have different views, social conservatives as well as progressives”. He said: “I want a tolerant Scotland where we can all work together for the good of the common weal. And I think that the SNP is still the main vehicle to achieve that and to take us towards independence. That will only happen if we pursue a different path and get rid of the dreadful deal with the extremist Greens.” Ewing has been a regular critic of the Bute House agreement, which was brokered by the former SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon after the 2021 Holyrood election, giving voice to growing disquiet within the Holyrood group and the wider party about the influence of the Greens on policymaking and electoral appeal. He has also criticised Green-led Scottish government policies on gender recognition reform and highly protected marine areas and regularly challenged the leadership on delays to widening Highland roads. While Ewing may be the most outspoken critic of the current leadership, he is supported by other significant figures including Kate Forbes, who was narrowly beaten by Humza Yousaf to the party leadership last year. Her supporters have previously told the Guardian that Yousaf may face a leadership challenge if SNP losses at the general election reach a tipping point. Ewing said the membership of the SNP should be allowed to vote on the Bute House agreement “now that we’ve had the experience of two and a half years of dismal mismanagement and duff policies from the Green party, which have only served to bring the SNP down in terms of votes and trust”. He said he had voted against Slater because that represented the views of “hundreds” of businesses he had spoken to who did not feel that the policy was being handled competently. “If my constituents wanted a doormat, they would have gone to B&Q,” he said. At a press conference on Wednesday morning, Yousaf denied Ewing’s suggestion that his party was authoritarian, as he published analysis estimating that 100,000 children will be kept out of relative poverty in 2024-25 as a result of Scottish government policies. Yousaf said tackling poverty remains the “driving mission” of his government, despite ferocious criticism from homelessness and child poverty groups of the Holyrood budget passed by MSPs on Tuesday. He said he understood charities’ frustrations but hoped that they appreciated the constraints on his budget, and he suggested charities should apply pressure on the incoming UK government.  “We will continue to take the actions as necessary within the powers that we have, but I would say to those charities … to equally exert pressure on the current and the incoming UK government to make the changes necessary to lift children out of poverty,” he said. He suggested that a new Labour government could “at the drop of a hat” decide to scrap the two-child limit and introduce an essentials guarantee to reform universal credit provision. Responding to the analysis, John Dickie, the director of the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) in Scotland, said the projection made clear that the government’s policy package was insufficient to reach its own legally binding target of less than one in 10 children living in poverty by 2030."

        "content": "MPs, some civil servants and other high-profile figures are having their calls to HM Revenue and Customs answered up to 12 times faster than the general public because they are able to access a “VIP” hotline. As a report found that customer service levels at HMRC have sunk to an “all-time low”, with users regularly encountering long call-waiting times, it has emerged that certain individuals are able to beat the queues by using a little-known fast-track helpline called “Public Department 1” (PD1). The average “speed of answer” for a member of the public calling to speak to someone at HMRC about their tax affairs was a little over 22 minutes in November and December 2023, according to the latest available figures. However, the average wait time for those able to avail themselves of the PD1 hotline was less than three minutes during the period July to December last year. In November it was just one minute and 53 seconds, rising to two minutes and 54 seconds in December.   Related: HMRC investigations of wealthy ‘tax dodgers’ halve in five years   Sarah Olney MP, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “This Conservative government has left HMRC terribly underfunded and understaffed, just like so many other public services. “These incredibly long wait times will be piling unnecessary stress on to people … Now we know there is a VIP lane for HMRC calls, allowing a privileged few to skip the queue to discuss their tax problems.” HMRC’s PD1 data did show that the average wait time has sometimes been a lot longer than two to three minutes: in March 2023 it was 10 minutes and 45 seconds. An HMRC spokesperson said: “PD1 is a dedicated helpline for those who need a greater level of protection due to their identity or job. It has nothing to do with people’s wealth.” They added that PD1 records were held separately, with only a small number of staff able to access them, and there were usually seven people answering calls to this helpline. MPs are among those able to use the hotline, on the grounds that their tax affairs can be more complex, and also for security reasons. It is also open to some civil servants, though it is understood that the vast majority do not use the PD1 helpline. A report by the cross-party public accounts committee published on Wednesday found that in 2022-23, 62% of callers waited more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser – up from 46% the previous year. On average, it took a little more than 16 minutes for someone to answer the phone – up from a little more than 12 minutes in 2021–22."

        "content": "More than half of Conservative party members believe Islam is a threat to the British way of life, according to a poll that sheds light on the hostility with which large parts of the party view the country’s second biggest religion. The poll of 521 Conservative members by Opinium found that 58% say Islam poses a threat to this country – double the proportion of the overall population who believe the same. It found that 52% believe the increasingly prominent conspiracy theory that parts of European cities are under sharia law and are “no-go” areas for non-Muslims. The findings give an insight into why senior members of the party have refused to condemn the recent comments by Lee Anderson about the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as Islamophobic. They also suggest the party is shifting to the right on immigration and religion in a way that could prove critical in deciding who will be leader if Rishi Sunak steps down after the election.  Interactive  Nick Lowles, the founder of Hope Not Hate, which commissioned the poll, wrote in an opinion piece in the Guardian: “It’s clear from the events of the past week that Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment runs deep in the Conservative party – but [this poll] illustrates the problem starkly.” Anderson’s comments last weekend sparked anger among some in the Tory party but received impassioned defence from many others. Anderson, who was the deputy party chair, said on GB News that he thought Khan, one of the country’s most prominent Muslim politicians, was being controlled by Islamists. Sunak removed the Tory whip from Anderson as a result but has refused to say the comments constitute Islamophobia. Downing Street said on Tuesday: “At a moment when tensions are running high, it is right for people to expect a high level of consideration to be given by politicians to the words they use.” Other prominent Conservatives have defended Anderson, including the former home secretary Suella Braverman who said on Monday that the row over his comments constituted “hysteria”. Anderson himself has since doubled down on what he said, refusing to apologise and attacking Khan for not banning pro-Palestinian marches in London. Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that grassroots Tory members are backing Anderson over Sunak. The Guardian revealed on Monday that members of the Conservative Democratic Organisation had sent each other WhatsApp messages calling Sunak a “snake” for suspending Anderson and argued that Anderson should be allowed to return. The Opinium poll also found Tory members are twice as likely to have a negative view of immigrants as a positive one, significantly more likely to have a negative view of feminists than a positive one, and slightly more likely to have a negative view of LGBT+ people than a positive one.  Interactive  Nearly three-quarters believed that immigration had been bad for Britain and that multiculturalism was not working, while 40% believed feminism had gone too far, compared with 28% who did not. A comparison with findings from a poll that Hope Not Hate commissioned in 2020 suggests these opinions are hardening. Four years ago 47% of Tory members said they believed Islam posed a threat to the British way of life. That 2020 poll was commissioned for the Singh review, an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative party, which found there was no evidence of institutional Islamophobia in the party. Some have criticised that review in recent days for being too narrowly focused. Sajjad Karim, a former Tory MEP, told the Guardian’s First Edition newsletter this week: “I can go back to about 2012 or 2013 when I first started to detect some of this type of talk. We haven’t got here suddenly. But the party really has to get a grip of it now.” He added: “[The Singh review] ended up sending a signal to the party membership that was basically ‘Muslims are fair game’.”   Related: Think Tories are Islamophobic? You don’t know the half of it – we have the figures | Nick Lowles   Lowles said: “Based on the views of Conservative members, it’s clear why Anderson, Braverman et al feel increasingly emboldened to push the boundaries of decency and speak negatively of Muslims, immigrants and multiculturalism more generally. The battle for the soul of the Conservative party has begun, and so far the radical right is winning.” While many Tory members hold hardline views on cultural and societal issues, they are not backing the candidates who arguably most represent those positions. The poll found that Braverman is only second favourite among members to be the next Tory leader with 16% support, while Kemi Badenoch, the combative business secretary, is third with 8%. The most popular candidate is instead the more centrist Penny Mordaunt, who commands the support of 22% of members."

        "content": "Customer service levels at HM Revenue and Customs have sunk to an “all-time low”, parliament’s spending watchdog has said. Users regularly encounter long call-waiting times as the tax department apparently struggles to cope with demand, a report by the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) has found. As demands on HMRC grow, the authority has not been given the resources needed to staff its phone lines, the report said. In 2022-23, 62% of callers waited more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser – up from 46% the previous year. On average, it took a little more than 16 minutes for someone to answer the phone – up from a little more than 12 minutes in 2021–22. However, in December there were reports of some callers facing waits of up to an hour to get through, with some people saying they ended up being cut off before their call was even answered. The tax office is trying to cope by weaning service users off speaking to a real person on the phone in favour of having them make do with YouTube videos and chatbots, the report found. Since the PAC’s last report in January 2023, HMRC’s performance “has continued to deteriorate”, and it has now resorted to closing customer support channels to prevent people from contacting it to sort out their tax affairs. As the taxpayer population increases along with the complexity of their tax affairs, MPs on the committee said that “it looks like HMRC is struggling to cope”. A lot of this is linked to growing numbers of people being pulled into the system as a result of “fiscal drag”, said the report. The freezing of personal income tax thresholds until 2028 will, over time, drag more and more low-income households into paying basic-rate tax, which kicks in at £12,570 a year, and those with earnings nearing £50,000 into the higher 40% rate, which kicks in at £50,270. Linked to this, the number of people who have to submit a self-assessment tax form has grown over the years: a decade ago it was just over 10 million people, but this year it was more than 12 million.   Related: HMRC investigations of wealthy ‘tax dodgers’ halve in five years   The report quoted HMRC as saying that more than half of the phone calls it received “are capable of being serviced through an online service instead, including webinars, YouTube videos, chatbots and web chat”. It has set itself a target to reduce incoming phone and post contact by 30% by 2025, compared with 2021–22. There has also been a significant drop in the number of criminal prosecutions by HMRC – from 691 in 2019-20 to 240 in 2022-23 – but at the same time there were cases where taxpayers “are being pursued repeatedly for often trivial amounts”. Dame Meg Hillier MP, chair of the committee, said its latest report into HMRC’s performance “sadly illustrates a continued tale of decline in its services”. An HMRC spokesperson said: “We’re making strong progress improving our customer services, with a focus on encouraging people to deal with us online where they can by providing quicker, easier and always available digital services.” They added that millions more people used HMRC’s online services last year, “saving them waiting on the phone and freeing up our advisers to deal with those people who need extra support”. Meanwhile, three-quarters of all customer correspondence was answered in 15 working days, “a significant improvement on the 45% in 2021-22”."

        "content": "An alleged victim of a serious sexual assault by a Conservative MP has accused the central party of being more concerned with protecting its own reputation than her welfare after it failed to formally investigate her complaint.  The woman, who must remain anonymous for legal reasons, claims to have told party whips about the alleged attack almost immediately afterwards, but no internal investigation took place. Her mental health subsequently deteriorated to such an extent that Conservative headquarters paid £15,000 for her to receive treatment at a private hospital. Speaking to the media for the first time, the woman said she remained upset that party chiefs failed to investigate the MP, and that she believed the central party’s poor handling of sexual misconduct complaints continues to put people at risk. “I want to make sure changes are made so that this never happens again,” she told the Guardian. “The complaints system is incredibly opaque. It needs to change now but it never will if the party remains more concerned with covering stuff like this up than the welfare of those involved. “No other major organisation would take no action if an individual came to them with an issue like this. There would be processes and procedures in place that would immediately be enacted regardless of whether anyone involved was brave enough to go to the police.” The woman said she told party representatives about the incident “almost immediately … but no action was taken. I felt like the central party system didn’t care about anything except protecting its own reputation. “I was extremely worried about how many other people in the past, or sadly in the future, would be similarly affected. And under the current leadership, unlike previous administrations, I have felt I became a problem, not a person, which has affected my health almost as much as the original incident.” However, the woman said that when she first came forward she had felt “heard” by several people who fought the “nonexistent Conservative party system” on her behalf. “There were a small number of women from both the two main parties supporting me emotionally, which was in their own time, not part of their job, and for which I will be forever grateful. “I also appreciated the support the central party provided by paying for me to go to a private hospital. I was assured that it would be private, but unfortunately it was not and was reported by the press.” It was first reported last year that the Conservative party had paid for the alleged victim to receive treatment. The Guardian understands the police confirmed to the alleged victim that several senior figures in the party, including in the whips’ office and at party headquarters, knew of her allegation. The woman said she made an official, in-person, complaint to the Tory whips’ office and subsequently made clear to them that she wanted it to be investigated. Within days of informing the party, the woman received a handwritten note on headed paper from a then whip who suggested she speak to the police. She did not feel comfortable going to the police at that time. They also gave her details of a charity that could help. She later spoke to Simon Hart, the current chief whip, who she said told her he could not remove the whip unless she made a formal complaint to the police. She claimed Hart suggested that if she did not, and subsequent allegations arose, she would be partly responsible. A source close to Hart said he denied that claim and suggested he had acted quickly. Oliver Dowden, who is now Rishi Sunak’s deputy prime minister, was believed to have been made aware of the allegation when he was the party chair. A source close to Dowden said: “At no point was this very serious allegation raised with Oliver Dowden by the police or anyone else.”  Dowden has previously denied the party covered up allegations against one of its MPs, specifically rejecting the idea there had been any kind of cover-up during his time in charge. After the woman did report the allegation to police, the MP was stripped of the Conservative whip and agreed to stay away from the parliamentary estate. The woman said she had since withdrawn from the police investigation because of the additional stress of her situation. The police have said they are investigating separate allegations against the MP. He has not been arrested and has previously denied any wrongdoing. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “We have an established code of conduct and formal processes where complaints can be made in confidence. The party considers all complaints made under the code of conduct, but does not conduct investigations where the party would not be considered to have primary jurisdiction over another authority, such as the police. “Where the party becomes aware of a complaint relating to possible criminal activity, we encourage the complainant to report this to the police. Additionally, for matters pertaining to parliament, the ICGS [independent complaints and grievance system] is an independent body set up by parliament, and the Conservative party respects its processes.” A police spokesperson said a number of non-recent allegations relating to the MP were being investigated. “A man has been voluntarily interviewed in connection with an investigation into allegations of serious sexual assault,” they said. “We would also remind everyone that victims of sexual offences are entitled to lifelong anonymity, regardless of how a case proceeds.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak is braced for another byelection after former Tory MP Scott Benton was suspended from the Commons for 35 days over his role in a lobbying sting. MPs approved the suspension of the Blackpool South MP on Tuesday evening without the need for a vote. The length of the suspension means that Benton is now facing a recall petition. If 10% of his constituents sign it, a byelection will be triggered in his seat. It would take the number of byelections held during Sunak’s time as prime minister to 11.  Benton, 36, had the Tory whip removed in April 2023 after suggesting to undercover reporters at the Times that he would be willing to break lobbying rules for money.Benton had offered to lobby ministers on behalf of the gambling industry and leak a confidential policy document for up to £4,000 a month. A subsequent investigation by parliament’s standards committee found he had committed a “very serious breach” of the rules and recommended a 35-day suspension from the Commons.Benton denied wrongdoing and appealed against the suspension to the independent expert panel (IEP), the body that sits above the standards committee. He appealed on the grounds that the procedure was flawed, claiming the decision was leaked by the committee. But last week, he lost his appeal against the suspension. The backbench MP has sat as an independent since being kicked out of the Conservative party. Blackpool South is a “red wall” seat, having backed the Labour party from the 1997 election until Benton’s win in 2019. It is one of the most deprived areas in England. Labour has selected the leftwing trade unionist Chris Webb as its prospective parliamentary candidate. Labour has comfortably won byelections in Wellingborough, Kingswood, Rutherglen, Tamworth, Selby, Wakefield and Mid Bedfordshire in recent times."

        "content": "The mayor of London, accused by a former senior Tory MP of being under the control of “Islamists”, is in fact facing death threats from Islamist extremists, the Guardian has learned. Sadiq Khan has been receiving police protection, usually reserved for a handful of senior cabinet ministers or royals, since 2017. A source with knowledge of the security arrangements said that as well as currently facing threats of violence from the extreme far right, Khan also faces threats from Islamist extremists. London’s mayor was vocal in denouncing Islamist terrorism when the city was subject to two Jihadist attacks in 2017, after the subsequent attack on Manchester, and when a far-right extremist targeted worshippers leaving a London mosque. Khan, the first Muslim mayor of the capital, has a team of about 15 police protection officers protecting him around the clock. Some Islamist extremists see Muslims in public office in western democracies as potential targets. As an MP, Khan voted for same-sex marriage and has championed gay rights as mayor. It also emerged on Tuesday that a man had pleaded guilty to making threats against Khan after Lee Anderson’s comments. Christopher Massey, 52, from Ipswich, twice called the control room of Suffolk constabulary. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed he had pleaded guilty on Monday to two counts of sending communication threatening death or serious harm. The threat was made on Saturday. The charge against Massey said that in the phone call to police he had “conveyed a threat of death or serious harm to another, intending or being reckless as to whether an individual encountering the message would fear that the threat would be carried out”. Massey is scheduled to be sentenced on 21 March at Ipswich magistrates court for the offences under the 2023 Online Safety Act. A source close to the mayor of London said: “Sadiq faces threats from a wide range of sources. His main concern has always been the safety of his family, and also that young people from his background will be put off entering public life.”"

        "content": "So who do you trust? Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, whom she and many other MPs believe will be the next leader of the Tory party? A woman whose loyalty extends primarily to herself. Even her family takes contemporaneous notes of any meeting just in case they find that memories differ. The corridors of Westminster are littered with enemies and allies whom she has stabbed in the back. Or Henry Staunton, the former chair of the Post Office who was sacked by Kemi in January? A man who has made a career out of being made chief executive or vice-chair of many companies about which he knows comparatively little. Of whom the worst that can be said is that – like many men of his acquaintance – he has been consistently promoted above his abilities. Being “a thoroughly good chap” counts far more than competence in Staunton’s world. So, not the greatest of choices to have to make. Though, on balance, most people would instinctively side with Henry. Primarily because those who know Kemi tend to dislike her even more than those who don’t know her. She manages to make Michael Gove look like someone you can rely on. Even when he’s out of his head on crack. On Tuesday, the business select committee was trying to see if it could get any nearer the truth. Ten days previously, Staunton had given an interview to the Sunday Times in which he said the government had leant on him to go slow in making financial compensation to post office operatives. Kemi had come out all guns blazing. She had never said anything like this and Henry was a fantasist. Worse than that he was a total scumbag. Someone who should never have been let anywhere near the Post Office. A disgrace to himself and the country. Staunton didn’t take this lying down. From the dregs of his email inbox he dragged out a message from Sarah Munby, a senior civil servant in Kemi’s department, suggesting he go slow on things that were going to cost the government. Cue a full-on fight. Kemi rubbishing Staunton. He was a useless old dodderer who had clearly misremembered – aka lied about – a meeting. And Henry giving as good as he got. Far from misremembering, it was all as clear as day. The conversation had been done on a nod and a wink basis with the subtext spelt out in capitals. Liam Byrne, the select committee chair, tried to get to the bottom of the matter. Maybe getting Staunton to take the unusual step of swearing the oath before giving evidence would help to jog his memory. Maybe he would realise that Kemi’s version of events had been right all along. Far from it. If anything Henry chose to double down. He knew exactly what had been meant because he had been so surprised that he had made notes of the conversation as soon as he had got back to his desk. By contrast, Munby had only got round to minuting her denial more than a year later after the shit had hit the fan. So which would you trust, asked an affable Staunton. A note made at the time. Or one made a year later. Mmm. Let me see … Henry went on. He hadn’t paid any attention to the government directive. Rather he had tried to make sure the post office operatives got what was due to them. Kemi’s department had done almost nothing until the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office was shown this year. It seemed like we were arguing about the difference between static and glacial. But at a corporate level maybe these differences are significant. Next to ask the questions was Jonathan Gullis. He wasn’t going to allow the good name of the woman who might be his next party leader – in absentia, in his case as he’s likely to lose his seat at the election – be traduced by this posh no-mark. Was it not the case that Staunton was lashing out? That he had been the subject of an 80-page disciplinary report that had formed the basis for his sacking? Gullis had clearly come well briefed by Kemi. That is precisely what she had leaked to the media outlets herself. “Er, not at all,” said Staunton. All confused charm. “What do you mean?” snapped Gullis. This wasn’t going to script. He had been there to showboat. It was like this, said Staunton. There had been one paragraph about disciplinary action for something he had said that was politically incorrect. The other 79 and three-quarter pages were concerned with disciplinary action being taken about Nick Read, the current chief executive of the Post Office. A look of panic began to cross Gullis’s face as he realised he had been stitched up by Kemi. That she had been less than truthful with him and others. Who would have guessed? So unlike her. Gullis wasn’t the first to regret sticking up for the business secretary. Nor would he be the last. Gullis began to hastily backtrack. Umm … well … I see … Fellow Tory Antony Higginbotham had fewer qualms. He would be loyal to Kemi to the day he died. Time and again, he tried to persuade Staunton to change his account. On every occasion, Henry would have none of this. It wasn’t long before we entered the world of the positively surreal. The thing was, said Henry, Nick hadn’t been at all happy at the Post Office. Didn’t reckon he was paid nearly enough. Talk about tin-eared. Some subpostmasters earned only £20k a year. Others had been bankrupted and wrongfully convicted. And all Read was bothered about was his own bank balance. It’s all heart in the corporate world. Staunton seemed oblivious to this. It was only natural that Nick had wanted more dosh. So he had seen what he could do about it with Grant Shapps. Because people like Henry always try to do their best for people like Nick. It’s how the world works. Like Oxbridge in the City. Nick had been terribly, terribly upset, Henry said. So much so that HR said he had threatened to resign. Now we were through the looking glass. Because only an hour earlier, Read had given evidence on oath to the committee saying he had never thought about quitting.  “I took 64 board meetings,” he complained. It had all been too, too tiring for him and the board. He told the committee that he had paid for media training before the morning’s session. He should ask for his money back. No wonder Alan Bates had earlier suggested that the Post Office was such a wreck it should be handed over to Amazon to run."

        "content": "  6.31pm GMT   We are now closing this blog, thanks for following developments with us. You can read all our UK politics coverage here.     6.11pm GMT  Early evening summary   Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, has told MPs that he is the victim of a “smear campaign” by the government because he stood up for the victims of the Horizon IT scandal. (See 2.46pm.) He also implied that Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, misled MPs when she said Staunton was being sacked partly because he was the subject of a misconduct inquiry. Staunton told MPs that it was Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, who is actually the subject of this inquiry. (See 2.58pm.) Kevin Hollinrake, the post services minister, subsequently told Politco:   We were very clear when we agreed to part company with Henry Staunton that we wouldn’t discuss those kinds of matters. So I think to talk about that, as a former chairman of a board, where you are bound by confidentiality, both while you’re in the role, and after, I think is entirely inappropriate.  As Politco points out, Badenoch herself did not seem too bothered about confidentiality when she told MPs that Staunton was the subject of bullying allegations.  Paul Scully, the former minister for London, has apologised for claiming yesterday there are “no-go areas” in parts of London and Birmingham. (See 3.52pm.)   Downing Street has said Lee Anderson’s comment about Sadiq Khan was unacceptable because it was wrong “to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism”. The PM’s spokesperson provided this explanation after Michael Tomlinson, the illegal migration minister, was cut off in a radio interview after he repeatedly refused to say what was wrong with Anderson’s comment. (See 9.21am.)   Updated at 6.13pm GMT    5.56pm GMT  Three quarters of voters want to see tax rates unchanged, or increased, poll suggests  Jeremy Hunt is reportedly considering cutting national insurance by 1p in the pound, Richard Partington reports.   Related: Budget 2024: Jeremy Hunt considers new vaping tax and NI cut   But polling by DeltaPoll for Channel 4 News suggests that three quarters of voters want to see taxes retained where they are now, or increased, because they care more about funding public services. In its summary of the findings C4 News says:  The poll of 1,500 UK voters, conducted between 23-26 February is released today ahead of the spring budget 2024 next week.  The new data shows that more than four in ten respondents (41%) believed that taxes and public spending should be kept at the level they are now. A further third (34%) said they would like to see taxes increased with greater spending on public services, while one in seven (14%) believed that taxes and public spending should be reduced. Among Conservative voters, that figure rose only marginally to one in six (17%). When asked to rank a list of economic priorities, voters placed cutting taxes fourth (11%), after growing the economy (23%), reducing inflation (22%), and investing in public service (12%), with 8% choosing to prioritise reducing the national debt, a cornerstone of shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves’ economic policy.  Polling now regularly suggests that voters believe funding public services is a higher priority than cutting taxes. But Hunt seems all set to ignore these survey results. That is partly because politicians suspect people don’t tell the truth when they are asked by pollsters about tax cuts and partly because, even if voters as a whole are not obsessed about tax cuts, Tory MPs and newspapers are.     5.20pm GMT   As Natasha Clark from LBC reports, a source “close to Kemi Badenoch” is hitting back against Henry Staunton more aggressively.

But while Read cooperated,…— Natasha Clark (@NatashaC) February 27, 2024   A source close to Kemi Badenoch said: “Henry Staunton has been nothing but a distraction against our work to get justice and compensation to the postmasters. Now he tries to deflect the focus onto Nick Read.  “He and Read were being investigated. But while Read cooperated, Staunton tried to block his investigation. As was said in the committee, Board members were going to resign. And still no one has corroborated his story.”      5.16pm GMT   In his evidence to the Commons business committee Henry Staunton, who was sacked as chair by Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, implied she misled MPs when she told them last week that he was sacked partly because of an inquiry into misconduct allegations against him. Staunton said it was actually Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, who is being investigated. (See 2.58pm.) As ITV’s Robert Peston reports, the Department for Business and Trade has issued a reponse. It says:  The department was aware that Nick Read was also under investigation, although we have not seen the 80 page report referred to by Henry Staunton and cannot attest to the content.  The secretary of state was clear in her statement to the House of Commons on 19 February that she lost confidence in Mr Staunton because he was blocking an investigation into his conduct, as well as his attempt to bypass the formal process to appoint a new director to the board.  It was these issues, as well as overall concerns about his grip on the Post Office – demonstrated by his discredited newspaper interview and the manner in which his story has changed in the following days – that led to his sacking. The department will await the outcome of the investigation into Mr Read before making any further judgment.      4.46pm GMT  Shelter Scotland accuses SNP government of failing on housing and homelessness  The Scottish government has been accused of “gaslighting” voters by the housing charity Shelter after homelessness in Scotland hit record levels, despite ministerial claims it is properly funding for housing and local councils. Several hours before Holyrood began voting on this year’s Scottish budget, official data showed Scottish councils had broken their legal duties to provide emergency housing nearly 1,600 times between May and September last year, while on 30 September 2023 there were 9,860 children in temporary accommodation, up 3 points since March, and 15,625 households in emergency accommodation – a new record. Alison Watson, the director of Shelter Scotland, said the Scottish National party and Scottish Greens government pushed through progressive policies, boasting Scotland has the best housing rights in the UK, but had a very patchy track record on adequately funding them. She said:   The Scottish government’s strategies for housing and homelessness are failing and any attempt to say otherwise is starting to feel like an attempt to gaslight the Scottish public. [It] can’t claim to be determined to fight poverty while presiding over record homelessness, repeatedly deprioritising housing in its spending choices, and ploughing ahead with a strategy which today’s figures once again clearly show isn’t working.  Shelter pointed to a 27% year on year cut in funding for the affordable housing supply programme, and a 5% cut in spending on housing support and homelessness, alongside real terms cuts to local council funding overall. That qualified ministerial claims that its £90m in discretionary housing payments were effective. Shona Robison, the deputy first minister, told MSPs these financial problems were exacerbated by the UK government’s housing cuts and urged Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, to increase spending on housing and capital investment in next week’s UK budget. She said ministers were setting up a new housing investment taskforce to help meet the goal of building 110,000 more affordable homes by 2032. This remained a “key priority”, she told MSPs. She went on:  If members today have alternative priorities, if they wish more investment to be made in one area, then I ask them to be straight with the people of Scotland, and say what they would cut to pay for it. [I] cannot stress enough the danger to Scotland’s public finances from the decisions of the UK government at the spring budget next week.      4.42pm GMT   The former prime minister Liz Truss told the rightwing Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) conference in the US last week that she would like to see the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage join the Tories. “I would like him to become a member of the Conservative party and help turn our country around,” she said. Many Tory MPs are not so keen, and it may never happen. But, according to a HuffPost UK story by Kevin Schofield, Labour officials have spent some time thinking through the implications of Farage becoming Tory leader. “With Farage you have to be prepared for anything,” a party source said.  Updated at 4.49pm GMT    4.25pm GMT  Home Office has 'long way to go' to improve border security, former independent borders watchdog tells MPs  Henry Staunton was not the only official sacked recently by the government from a prominent public post who has been giving evidence to MPs today. As Staunton was still speaking about how Kemi Badenoch terminated his contract as Post Office chair, David Neal started speaking to the home affairs committed about being dismissed as the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration.  Here are some of the main points from his evidence.  Neal said there was a “long way to go” to improve border security. He said:   In my best judgment, I would suggest there is some way to go for the workings of Border Force – because that’s one of the areas we inspect – to work to its optimum level … There’s a long, long way to go with the functioning of security at the border and the role that Border Force plays within it.   He said he had been sacked for doing his job. He said:   I’ve been sacked for doing my job. I think I’ve been sacked for doing what the law asks of me and I’ve breached, I’ve fallen down over a clause in my employment contract, which I think is a crying shame.  When he was sacked, the Home Office was sitting on 15 reports he had submitted that had not been published. Neal had started to reveal some of their findings to journalists, and the Home Office said he was sacked because he had given the Daily Mail false information about passengers on high-risk private jets not being subject to security checks.  He said the manner of his dismissal revealed “shocking leadership” by the Home Office. He said:   For my high-performing team of 30 civil servants, the notification that I was sacked was in the media before my team or I had had the chance to speak to them, which is just shocking. Shocking leadership.   He claimed No 10 had blocked his reappointment. He said:   I now know that the Home Office, so the ministers, supported my reappointment, my extension, my reappointment. And the home secretary supported my reappointment. That reappointment process was sent to the Cabinet Office and that was sent on to No 10 and it was turned down by No 10. So I’ve no idea why it was turned down by No 10.  Neal was due to leave his post in March because he had not been given a second term in office. But last week he was sacked with immediate effect after the Mail story appeared.  He said that James Cleverly, the home secretary, was wrong when he told the committee recently Neal could have applied for a second term. “If I was offered to reapply, then I would have been delighted,” Neal said.      4.03pm GMT  Labour demands Tory London mayor candidate apologise for ‘Islamophobia’  Labour has demanded an apology from Sadiq Khan’s Conservative opponent in the London mayoral election over comments and actions that led to her being accused of Islamophobia and racism. Ben Quinn has the story.   Related: Labour demands Tory London mayor candidate apologise for ‘Islamophobia’       3.59pm GMT   The House of Commons library is one of the less showy but more useful branches of parliament, producing an endless stream of learned reports about political life – among them this new analysis of the number of female MPs. Their spreadsheet shows that in the 106 years since women have been able to stand for the Commons, 564 have been elected, the most recent of whom is Gen Kitchen, the brand new Labour MP for Wellingborough. This is still less than the 650 total of all the MPs currently in the Commons. The research does nonetheless show that things are moving more quickly. When Harriet Harman was elected in 1982, she was just the 114th woman ever. The halfway point to the current total of 282 female MPs was only reached at the 2005 election. The library’s briefing points out that it was only in December 2016 when the combined total of all women MPs reached the number of men in the Commons at that time. Caroline Johnson, who won the Sleaford and North Hykeham byelection, became no 455, matching the total number of male MPs then in the Commons. The current gender balance is 226 women out of 650 MPs, the highest total ever. After the 2019 general election it was 220, but since then six female MPs have died, stood down or been removed via a recall petition, with 12 winning byelections. Finally, while most people know of Nancy Astor as the first female MP, in 1919, she was simply the first to sit in the Commons. A year before, Constance, Countess Markievicz won a Dublin seat in the general election, but as a Sinn Féin’s representative she did not take the seat. UPDATE: A reader has sent a link to this interactive graphic from the Pudding, which illustrates very well how long it took for the number of women in the Commons to increase. It might take a moment to load, but there is a lot of info there when you get to it.  Updated at 4.58pm GMT    3.52pm GMT  Former minister Paul Scully apologises for saying there are 'no-go areas' in London and Birmingham  Paul Scully, the former minister for London, has apologised for claiming yesterday there are “no-go areas” in parts of London and Birmingham. In an interview with the News Agents podcast, he said:  I think I do regret the use of the word “no-go areas’, because I think that actually has other connotations that are hadn’t really taken on board. And I’m slightly furious with myself, the fact that actually that’s allowed my message to be misconstrued. What I was trying to say was that the kind of comments that we’ve heard from Lee Anderson and others in recent days and weeks, the populist approach, sometimes is fuelled by conversations that people have, and perceptions that people have, in cities around the UK. I mentioned Tower Hamlets and Birmingham, where very small groups of people really misuse and abuse their doctrine in terms of Islamic gangs, but it can be black gangs, white gangs, etc. And then people write off a whole community because of the actions of mindless and slightly threatening small group of people. And so it’s areas that people feel uncomfortable in on occasion. But that’s the different from a no-go area in terms of the wider context, and for that I do apologise.   Updated at 3.54pm GMT    3.43pm GMT   Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, has said that it was “entirely inappropriate” for Henry Staunton to talk to the Commons business committee about Nick Read, the chief executive, being investigated over a misconduct complaint. (See 2.58pm.) This is from Emilio Casalicchio from Politico.  NEW: Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake tells me claims from Henry Staunton about PO CEO Nick Read were \"astounding\" and \"entirely inappropriate.\" More in Playbook PM after 5pm.— Emilio Casalicchio (@e_casalicchio) February 27, 2024        3.34pm GMT   This is what Henry Staunton told the business committee about Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, wanting to resign.  Huge, huge pressures on him. I must have had four conversations when he said he was going to chuck it in. And my job was just to be someone that would understand the pressures that he was on, because I think it would be very difficult to find a replacement at this stage with the business in the state that it’s in. If I didn’t think he was doing satisfactorily, I’d have asked to change things.  Staunton said he had raised this with Grant Shapps, the then business secretary, and Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, but they both ruled out paying Read more. At the end of his evidence, Read was asked by Liam Byrne, the chair, if he had ever “tried to resign” as chief executive. Read said he hadn’t.     3.05pm GMT   The business committee hearing has just ended. Liam Byrne, the chair, concluded by saying that Staunton had told him that Nick Read had considered resigning, even though earlier in the session that Read had denied this on oath. Staunton said he would also have liked the chance to deny the allegation made by Badenoch that he had mishandled the process for appointing a new director to the board. He said he had acted “scrupulously” in this.     2.58pm GMT  Staunton says it's Nick Read who is subject to misconduct inquiry, not him, contrary to what Badenoch implied  Asked to explain why Kemi Badenoch told MPs that he was under investigation over serious allegations, Staunton said this related to Nick Read, the chief executive, falling out this his HR director. He said she produced an 80-page report setting out complaints about Read. He said one paragraph related to him, alleging he made a politically incorrect comment. He said this did not mean that he personally was the subject of an investigation. He said Read found dealing with this complaint very stressful, and considered resigning. Asked if the investigation into Read was still underway, Read said it was. Jonathan Gullis (Con), who was asking the questions, said the committee did not realise this. He told Read he had '“made news”.  Updated at 4.59pm GMT    2.46pm GMT  Staunton says he is victim of 'smear campaign' by government because he has stood up for post office operators  Staunton told the committee he would like to read a statement he had prepared in advance. He said he did this because he did not realise the Post Office would be presenting its own case in writing. He said:  What happened to these poor postmasters in their families is a tragedy and a scandal. They have been failed time and time again by a whole host of British institutions, who are supposed to be there to protect the citizen and ensure fair play. We all know that they weren’t. We all know that there was inaction all round by the judicial system, the government, Whitehall and particularly inside the Post Office until the ITV drama, Mr. Bates v the Post office, and there was a rocket put under the secretary of state … We all know that things were moving far too slowly … and the reason why people have latched onto what I said in the Sunday Times was that finally someone was being honest about how deep seated the problems were and why nothing was being done. I still think that more could be done, at least to make compensation more generous, and the process of getting justice less bureaucratic. But I will at least have achieved something if the sunlight of disinfectant, which the secretary of state so approves of, means that government now lives up to its promises. What the public wants to know is why was everything so slow? … And why does everything remain so slow? I’ve spoken up on matters of genuine public concern, have been fired, and am now subject to a smear campaign.   Updated at 6.16pm GMT    2.36pm GMT   Asked what he felt about the government’s allegations against him (Kemi Badenoch has called him a liar), Staunton said that he had experience in corporate governance going back decades. He said that he was considered a successful company chair. That would not have happened if he was the sort of person his critics claim, he suggests.     2.32pm GMT  Staunton says Post Office chief executive was justified in saying he 'personally' was never told to slow compensation payments  Byrne asks about the statement from Nick Read, the chief executive of the Post Office, saying he has never been told to delay compensation payments. The government has cited this as proof that Staunton’s claims are wrong.  In a letter to the committee Read said:  For the avoidance of doubt, I personally have never been instructed to delay on compensation, nor have any of my leadership team to my knowledge – and have worked closely with government officials and ministers to deliver compensation as quickly as we can.  Staunton said that Read was able to say this honestly because he personally was not told to slow compensation payments. He says that when he told Read what he had been told by Sarah Munby, they agreed that they would not do this.      2.23pm GMT  Staunton dismisses suggestion there was misunderstanding over 'stall compensation payments' chat with top official  Liam Byrne, the chair, is questioning Staunton. Q: Your note of your conversation with Sarah Munby does not specifically refer to compensation? Staunton says his note was not a full record of what was said. Q: Kemi Badenoch says the money for compensation was ring fenced, and so the Post Office had no incentive to slow compensation payments. Staunton says, if you read the Post Office accounts, they will show that there is not a “hard ring fence” for the compensation payments. Q: In her record of the conversation, Munby gives a different account. Staunton says the version published by Munby last week was written a year after the conversation. He says his note was contemporaneous. Q: Do you think she is lying? Staunton says he does not want to get into that. He is just setting out what happened from his point of view. Q: Could Munby have had a different interpretation of the conversation with you? Staunton suggests that’s unlikely. He goes on:  When you’re talking about three levers – this is not a PhD in accounting. This is three very simple issues that we’re talking about.    Updated at 2.23pm GMT    2.12pm GMT  Former Post Office chair Henry Staunton insists he was told to slow compensation payments  Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, is giving evidence now. He is also asked to swear on oath he will tell the truth. Here is a summary of what he alleged in his Sunday Times interview, and here is a summary of Kemi Badenoch’s response. Q: Where you ever told to slow down compensation payments? Staunton says he wants to use the phrase “a nod and a wink”. He says he met Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the business department, in January last year. Summarising all the problems at the Post Office, he said it would take three to five years to turn things round – probably five years. He says Munby told him this was not a time for long-term planning, because money was tight. He says there were only three spending levers they could change: the inquiry costs, the compensation costs, and the need for a new Horizon system. He says he told Munby that the inquiry costs could not be changed, the compensation had to be paid, and the Post Office desperately needed a new IT system. He says Munby told him again money was tight, and this was “not the time to rip off the band aid’. He says this conversation was so unusual he made a note of it. He says he discussed this with Nick Read. Read says ‘“they live in a different world”, he says.  Updated at 10.31am GMT    2.02pm GMT   Liam Byrne, the committee chair, ended the session with Read by asking why the committee should have confidence in him given that only 20% of the money set aside for compensation has been paid out, there are complaints the system is too slow, and the culture has not been changed. Read replied saying he was “delivering great things for the Post Office”. He said trading was excellent, and trust was improving.     1.59pm GMT  Read says mass exoneration bill for victims of Post Office Horizon scandal 'least worst option'  Charlotte Nichols (Lab) is asking the questions now. She asks Read to confirm that he supports the government’s plan for a bill exonerating post office operators convicted on Horizon evidence. (His earlier answer was somewhat ambiguous – see 1.24pm.) Read replies:  We support anything that is going to accelerate justice for wronged postmasters.  Q: Do you think some post office operators are guilty as charged, as Nick Vamos said. Why is there opposition from you to the plan? Read says he is not opposed to the plan. Q: Do you think some of them are guilty? Read says:  There may well be people [who are guilty included in the exoneration scheme], but it is the least worst option.  He suggests there might be “one or two” people in this category.     1.51pm GMT   Jonathan Gullis asks Read if he has training to prepare for today’s select committee hearing. Read says of course he has prepared for this. It is an important hearing. Gullis asks about a Telegraph story saying the Post Office is spending £15,000 a month on a City PR firm, TB Cardew. He suggests they coached Read for today’s hearing, and he says this implies the Post Office is paying to spin its way out of a crisis.  Read does not accept that. He says they are a big organisation and they use a PR organisation to promote themselves properly.     1.46pm GMT   Back at the business committee, asked if he is happy with pay rates for post office operators, Nick Read, the chief executive, says he is not. Q: Can you commit to ensuring all post office operators get X% of the minimum wage? Read says the Post Office has hardship funds. It wants to ensure the proportion of revenue going to post office operators increases year on year.     1.43pm GMT  Pause in Gaza fighting leading to sustainable ceasefire 'in reach right now', Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell tells MPs  Turning away from the business committee, Andrew Mitchell, the development minister and de facto deputy foreign secretary, has told MPs that a pause in the conflict in Gaza which could pave the way for a sustained ceasefire is “in reach right now”, In a statement to MPs, he said:  The most effective way to end the fighting in Gaza, the absolute focus of our diplomatic efforts right now, is to agree an immediate humanitarian pause. This would allow for the safe release of hostages and a significant increase in the aid going to Gaza. Crucially, it would also provide a vital opportunity to establish the conditions for a genuinely long-term and sustainable ceasefire without a return to destruction, fighting and loss of life. That is the position shared by our close partners. It is an outcome that we believe is in reach right now and we urge all sides to seize it.      1.38pm GMT  Henry Staunton's conduct 'somewhat erratic' in weeks before he was sacked as Post Office chair, MPs told  Asked about allegations that one of the problems with Henry Staunton was that he was not “alert” during meetings, Tidswell says that is not a concern he raised. But he says he was the person who had to tell Staunton that there had been a complaint about him and that after that his conduct changed. “His behaviour changed in a way that was somewhat erratic,” Tidswell says. He says this happened from November. But Staunton was not falling asleep in meetings, he says.     1.34pm GMT   Andy McDonald (Ind) takes Nick Read back to the Vamos letter. (See 1.24pm.) Read says he did not tell the Post Office board about the need to send that letter to the Ministry of Justice. He says he did not feel the need to do that.  Updated at 1.46pm GMT    1.31pm GMT   Ben Tidswell, chair of the Post Office’s remediation committee, told the business committee that Carl Creswell, an official from the Department for Business and Trade, was right when he told the committee earlier that Tidswell had told him that some board members might resign if Henry Staunton were not sacked. (See 11.14am.) Asked about the allegations against Staunton, Tidswell said:  There were a number of concerns, the most significant of which were that Mr Staunton was obstructing investigations and particularly the investigation into him, the whistleblowing investigation into him. And he had taken steps to circumvent the shareholder’s position in relation to the appointment of my replacement.      1.24pm GMT  Read rejects claim that letter to justice department showed Post Office wanted to block mass exoneration law  Gullis asked about the letter sent by the Post Office to the justice department last month saying it would oppose attempts to overturn 369 of the cases that have been identify as Horizon miscarriage of justice cases. Here is the Read letter, and here is the legal note it referred to, an opinion from Nick Vamos, head of business crime at Peters & Peters, the solicitors advising the Post Office. Read said he did not solicit the note from Vamos. But, having received it, he felt obliged to pass it on to the justice department, he said Gullis put it to him that this showed the Post Office wanted to stop the government from legislating to exonerate former post office operators. Read did not accept that. He said he was just making sure that the government had all the available information before it legislated. He said if mass exoneration was the right way forward, it was important to do it properly.     1.14pm GMT   Jonathan Gullis (Con) is asking the questions now. He puts it to Nick Read that people like Alan Bates are saying the culture of the Post Office has not changed. (See 11.46am.) Read insists it is changing. He says:  I think we’ve made a lot of progress in, certainly since 2019.  Don’t get me wrong. This is a scandal. It’s gone on for 25 years … It won’t be changed overnight. But we’ve made progress.       1.10pm GMT   Simon Recaldin, the Post Office’s remediation matters director, tells the Commons business committee that post officer operators can claim for legal advice to help them fill in the claim form. He says that the amount they could get for legal advice used to be capped at £1,200. But now there is no cap, he says. The Post Office will pay whatever sum is reasonable, he claims. Asked what the upper limit is, he says it is whatever is reasonable. Liam Byrne, the committee chair, says former post office operators who have spoken to the committee did not seem to be aware that the cap had been lifted. They felt £1,200 was not enough to fund the legal advice they needed, he suggests. Q: Have you ever been asked to limit compensation payments? No, says Recaldin.     12.52pm GMT  Read accepts he has not got written evidence to show government told him to speed up compensation payments  Byrne put it to him that in all the documentation submitted to the committee from the Post Office there was no written evidence showing that it has been told by the government to speed up compensation payments. Read accepted that, but said that this was an issue discussed with the government regularly. He said that he has not had a conversation with Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, about accelerating the compensation scheme. But he has discussed this with Kevin Hollinrake, the post services minister, he said.     12.44pm GMT  Read denies being told to slow down compensation payments  Asked if he had ever been asked to slow down compensation payments, Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, said he had not. Asked if he thought Henry Staunton was lying when he said he had been told to do that by Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the business department at the time, Read said he thought what Staunton said was not accurate. But he suggested that Staunton might have misinterpreted what Munby said to him.     12.38pm GMT  Post Office chief executive Nick Read and colleagues asked to give evidence on oath at Commons business committee  Back at the business committee, four witnesses from the Post Office are now giving evidence. They are: Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office; Ben Tidswell, chair of its remediation committee; Simon Recaldin, its remediation matters director; and Simon Oldnall, its Horizon and GLO IT director. Liam Byrne, chair of the committee, started by requiring them all to swear an oath saying the evidence they would give would be the truth. This is unusual in select committee hearings, and earlier witnesses were not required to swear an oath. Byrne told the Post Office witnesses that not telling the truth would be contempt of parliament.     12.34pm GMT  No 10 says Lee Anderson's language wrong because 'it's unacceptable to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism'  At the Downing Street lobby briefing yesterday No 10 was reluctant to explain what it was about Lee Anderson’s comment about Sadiq Khan that was “wrong”. After Michael Tomlinson came unstuck on this question this morning (see 9.21am), Downing Street clearly decided it needed to come up with an answer and at the lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson did explain what was wrong with what Anderson said. The spokesperson said:  The prime minister responded to these questions yesterday, he doesn’t believe that the individual is a racist but … the language he used was wrong and it’s unacceptable obviously to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism or the extreme ideology of Islamism. That’s why the PM regarded those comments as wrong and unacceptable.      11.59am GMT   The Commons business committee is now taking evidence from Dr Neil Hudgell from Hudgell Solicitors and James Hartley from Freeths, two legal firms representing former post office operators.     11.58am GMT   Back at the business committee Liam Byrne, the chair, ended the hearing with the three former post office operators by asking what legislation MPs could pass to improve the situation. Bates backed three proposals: taking the Post Office out of the the scheme; setting binding deadlines for the payment of compensation; and imposing fines if those deadlines are not met, with the money going for former post office operators.     11.53am GMT  SNP's Stephen Flynn says Commons speaker 'effectively lied' when he offered second debate on Gaza  Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Wesminster, said today the Commons speaker Sir Linsay Hoyle “effectively lied” when he suggested last week that the SNP hold an emergency debate to make up for the chaos that surrounded their original motion on Gaza. Flynn told BBC Radio Scotland that he had wanted to work with other party leaders on a motion that not only supported an immediate ceasefire, but then set out tangible next steps, including ending arms sales to Israel and mandating the UK government to vote at the United Nations in favour of an immediate ceasefire. He reiterated his call for Hoyle to resign – he and SNP colleagues have already signed an early day motion calling for this – saying:  We don’t think that the speaker of the House of Commons is fit to continue in his role. He was obviously bullied into submission last week by the leader of the Labour party.  When it was pointed out by the interviewer that both Keir Starmer and Hoyle had denied this, Flynn said that was “like me denying that I’m a bald”. He went on:  Everyone that on Westminster estate knows what happened last week. So the reality is the speaker was unduly influenced by the leader of the Labour party, and as a result, he subsequently lied to the SNP because he created a complete circus in Westminster.      11.46am GMT  Post Office is 'dead duck' and 'money pit' for taxpayers which should be sold off to firm like Amazon for £1, Bates tells MPs  The former post office operators giving evidence to the business committee said there was a problem with the whole culture at the Post Office. Bates said the Post Office was a “dead duck” and had been for years. He said:  I think over the years I’ve been dealing with Post Office, the culture has always been Post Office. It hasn’t changed, it’s been the same for donkey’s years – it will not change and you cannot change it. My personal view about Post Office is it’s a dead duck and it has been for years, and it’s going to be a money pit for the taxpayer in the years to come. You should sell it to someone like Amazon for £1, get really good contracts for all the serving sub-postmasters and within a few years you’ll have one of the best networks around Britain.   Updated at 5.00pm GMT    11.34am GMT  What Kemi Badenoch told business committee about why Henry Staunton was sacked  The question from Jonathan Gullis about possible Post Office board resignations if Henry Staunton had not been sacked (see 11.14am) may have been prompted by a line in a letter from Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, to Liam Byrne, chair of the committee. The letter was published by the committee yesterday. This is what she says in it about her decision to dismiss Staunton.  [Staunton] made false claims about my conversation with him [the one where he was sacked], including that: 1. I told him that “someone’s got to take the rap” for the Horizon scandal, and that was the reason for his dismissal, and; 2. I refused to apologise to him after he learned of his dismissal from Sky News.  As I said in my statement, these claims are completely fictitious, and I have deposited copies of the readout of the dismissal call in the libraries of both houses to demonstrate this. The note of our conversation, written at the time by officials, has been made public and clearly records my apology that someone had leaked the story to the media. It also shows that I explained that Mr Staunton’s dismissal was due to allegations of serious governance failures and allegations of personal misconducts at Post Office Limited; there is no mention of the Horizon scandal.  It may assist the committee to know that the sequence of events leading to my call with Mr Staunton was that members of the Post Office Board raised concerns about his behaviour with my officials formally on 22 January 2024. Following careful consideration of the complaints provided to me about his conduct, I then informed Mr Staunton on 27 January that I was exercising my right as shareholder and removing him as chair.  It should be noted that Mr Staunton has changed his story since his interview: he now claims that it was the characterisation of our conversation that led him to believe he had to “take the rap” rather than any specific statement by me.      11.26am GMT  Post Office compensation scheme not getting any better, Alan Bates tells MPs  At the business committee three former post office operators are now giving evidence. They are Alan Bates, founder of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance and the person whose story formed the basis of the ITV drama that turbocharged political interest in the scandal; Tony Downey, another former post officer operator; and Tim Brentnall, another post officer operator. Asked if there has been any improvement in the speed at which compensation is being dealt with, Bates said there had not been in his case. He said his claim was being refused. Asked if he was happy with the way things were going, he replied:  It’s very disappointing, it’s been going on for years, and I can’t see an end to this.  He said it would be better if responsibility for handling the compensation scheme were removed from the Post Office. Downey and Brentnall also criticised the way the compensation scheme was working  Updated at 11.37am GMT    11.16am GMT   At the end of the hearing with the first panel of witnesses, Liam Byrne, the chair, said he was not convinced all compensation payments in the GLO scheme would be paid by August. Creswell said that was the target.     11.14am GMT  Some Post Office board members may have resigned if Kemi Badenoch had failed to sack Henry Staunton, MPs told  Jonathan Gullis (Con) asks Creswell if he was told that members of the Post Office board might leave if Henry Staunton was not removed as chair. Creswell says he was told that. Those complaints came to him, and this point was made to him about Staunton. He says there were concerns about Staunton’s conduct, and “anxiety” that board members might leave if Staunton did not. This answer is helpful to Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary who sacked Staunton. In a statement to MPs last week she was right to sack Staunton because of his conduct, and she claimed that his allegations about the government (mainly that it was stalling compensation payments, but there were others) were motivated by the desire for revenge. Asked to give details, Creswell says that Staunton was trying to silence a whistleblower critical of what he was doing, and that there were problems with how Staunton was trying to replace a director on the board. UPDATE: Asked if people would resign if Staunton were not sacked, Creswell replied:  Yes, I was told that explicitly.  Asked if he was told that by just one person, he said:  By one individual on behalf of two members of the board. So, the complaints about Mr Staunton’s behaviour came to me and I had a phone call with Mr [Ben] Tidswell … he is the senior independent director on the Post Office board and his job is – among other things – to hold the chair to account. So, it was he who contacted me and, indeed, he did say, as you have suggested, that the level of anxiety about Mr Staunton’s behaviour was such that we might see resignations from the board.   Updated at 11.40am GMT    11.00am GMT   Back at the business committee Andy McDonald (elected as a Labour MP, but currently sitting as an independent after having the whip withdrawn) complained about the amount of compensation being offered to post officer operators. He said what happend to them was “born of malice”. As a result, he said, compensation should not just cover loss of earnings, and other ways people were disadvantaged. He said there should be “aggravated and exemplary” damages to reflect the malice involved. Sir Ross Cranston, the former Labour solicitor general who is now independent reviewer of the Post Office GLO scheme, said the scheme was operating on the basis that compensation should be “full and fair”. But that went beyond just paying people for what they lost, he said.     10.53am GMT  Labour would lift block on onshore windfarms, says Ed Miliband  Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, has claimed a “culture of inertia and stasis” has blocked renewable energy projects under the Conservatives. He also said Labour will overturn a de facto onshore wind ban “at the stroke of a pen” if it wins the general election. Alex Lawson has the story here.   Related: Labour would lift block on onshore windfarms, says Ed Miliband       10.47am GMT   Liam Byrne, the committee chair, showed the hearing a chart illustrating the process for getting compensation under the Group Litigation Order. Byrne said the committee has been told by post office operators that getting a disclosure report from the Post Office, stage one of the process, was proving difficult. Creswell told him reports have been issued now in 55% of cases. But he said they were now coming more quickly, and that the disclosure reports were being submitted more quickly than new claims were coming in. Byrne suggested he found it hard to believe that all claims would be settled by August at this rate. Creswell pushed back, saying he was broadly satisfied with the rate at which the scheme was proceeding.     10.38am GMT   There are 478 post office operators in the system for the Group Litigation Order scheme. (See 10.30am.) Creswell told the committee that 106 of them have submitted full claims. He said 104 offers had been made, 80 of them had been accepted, and 76 had been paid. There were another 41 partial claims, he said. Creswell said he wanted everyone in the scheme to submit a claim, and that his goal was to get them all paid by August.     10.30am GMT  Government official in charge of compensation for post office operators insists there was no order to slow payments  At the Commons business committee Carl Creswell, an official from the Department for Business and Trade who oversees compensation payments for post office operators, is giving evidence now. There are three separate compensation schemes: the Group Litigation Order scheme, which is for the 55 post office operators who were unfairly prosecuted (they sued the Post Office, but most of the £58m settlement was swallowed up in legal fees); the Overturned Convictions scheme; and the Horizon Shortfall scheme, which is for post office operators who were not convicted but who were made to pay money to the Post Office for supposed shortfalls now blamed on Horizon errors. Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, told the Sunday Times recently that he had been told to stall compensation payments until the election. Asked if that was the case, Creswell said that, if there had been an order to delay compensation payments, “someone would have mentioned it to me”. But did that happen? “Not at all,” he said. UPDATE: Creswell said:  You would have thought someone would have mentioned it to me if that were the intent. Not at all. I worked very closely with Sarah Munby [the permanent secretary at the business department alleged by Henry Staunton to have told him to delay compensation payments], she and I worked with Treasury to secure the funding needed for the schemes. Every conversation I had with her, with ministers, with other senior civil servants in other parts of government, have all been about how we can pay out this money more quickly, so, no, that is completely incorrect that assertion.   Updated at 10.42am GMT    10.11am GMT   Yesterday the Commons business committee published a series of documents it had received from the Post Office and the government in response to questions it had asked ahead of today’s hearing. You can find them all here.     9.52am GMT  Commons business committee takes evidence on Post Office Horizon scandal  The Commons business committee will be starting a marathon evidence session at 10am on the Post Office Horizon scandal. Here is the list of witnesses appearing. 10am: Carl Creswell, director of business resilience at the Department for Business and Trade; Mark Chesher, a partner at Addleshaw Goddard; Rob Francis, a partner at Dentons Solicitors; and Ross Cranston, the independent reviewer, of the Post Office GLO scheme (one of the compensation schemes). 11am: Alan Bates, founder of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance; Tony Downey, another former post officer operator; and Tim Brentnall, another post officer operator 11.30am: Dr Neil Hudgell, executive chairman at Hudgell Solicitors, and James Hartley, a partner and head of dispute resolution at Freeths. 12pm: Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office; Ben Tidswell, chair of its remediation committee; Simon Recaldin, its remediation matters director; and Simon Oldnall, its Horizon and GLO IT director. 1pm: Henry Staunton, Post Office chair until he was sacked by Kemi Badenoch last month  Updated at 11.59am GMT    9.42am GMT  Lee Anderson 'has many, many merits' and is not racist, says legal migration minister Tom Pursglove  Tom Pursglove, the legal migration minister, was also giving interviews this morning. Like Michael Tomlinson (see 9.21am), he also refused to say that Lee Anderson’s comment about Sadiq Khan last week was Islamphobic. But he told Times Radio:  I don’t think Lee personally is racist, but what he said was unacceptable.  He also said that he had worked with Anderson on a number of constituency issues such as helping disabled people into work and providing sanctuary for Ukrainian refugees. He went on:  I think, actually, Lee has many, many merits and for me those issues, those experiences, that engagement that I’ve had, is actually a very different side to the Lee that is portrayed in the media.      9.21am GMT  Minister cut off during interview after refusing to say why Lee Anderson’s Sadiq Khan slur was wrong  Good morning. Yesterday Rishi Sunak spent all day in interviews describing Lee Anderson’s claim about the Labour mayor of London (“I don’t actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they’ve got control of [Sadiq] Khan, and they’ve got control of London”) as wrong, while dodging questions about whether the comment was Islamophobic. The obvious follow-up was why was it wrong. Sunak managed to get through interviews yesterday without being up-ended by this challenge, but this morning on LBC Michael Tomlinson, the illegal immigration minister, was cut off after repeatedly refusing to answer this question. Tomlinson was being interviewed by Nick Ferrari who started by asking why Anderson had to have the whip suspended. Because what he said was wrong, Tomlinson replied. Ferrari repeatedly asked why Anderson’s comment was wrong, and Tomlinson just kept replying: “What he said was wrong.” Ferrari then tried a different tack, and asked if the comment was Islamphobic. But he did not have any more joy with that either, because Tomlinson just replied: “What he said was wrong.” After two more times, and getting the same answer again, an exasperated Ferrari, who said he was “normally a very polite man”, told listeners:  I have to curtail the interview. I’m grateful for your time but enough already. Michael Tomlinson is a minister of state for illegal migration unable to answer a question.  It was a slice of radio that perfectly captured how moronic government ministers sound when they slavishly parrot the line to take from No 10, when they lack the wit or nous to dodge a question without making it too obvious. Listeners must have been cheering when Ferrari pushed the ejector seat button, and it would be nice if other presenters did this a bit more often too. But the episode also illustrates why the Lee Anderson row is so difficult for Sunak and the Conservative party. No 10 does not want ministers describing what Anderson said as racist or Islamophobic (even though Anderson himself has subtly distanced himself from the core part of his allegation against Khan last week – see below) because it wants to draw a line under this affair. And that is for three reasons: 1) Anderson has significant support amongst Tories (again, see below); 2) conceding Anderson’s comment was racist would open Suella Braverman up to the same charge; and 3) this would also accelerate a wider debate about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, which Sunak would rather avoid. In other developments on this story:  Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, has suggested that the No 10 response to Anderson’s comments amounts to “hysteria”. She posted this on X last night.   We need to urgently focus now on the big problem: how to tackle Islamist extremism in the UK. The hysteria in response to those calling out the crisis is one of the reasons why we’re not making progress. Language does matter but it’s time for resolute government action: 1/2— Suella Braverman MP (@SuellaBraverman) February 26, 2024   We need to urgently focus now on the big problem: how to tackle Islamist extremism in the UK.The hysteria in response to those calling out the crisis is one of the reasons why we’re not making progress.Language does matter but it’s time for resolute government action:  Braverman, of course, wrote an article for the Telegraph last week saying that Keir Starmer was “in hock to the Islamists” and that “the truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now.”  Grassroots Conservative supporters have called Rishi Sunak a “snake” over Lee Anderson’s suspension, the Guardian has reported. Here is our story by Eleni Courea, Ben Quinn and Pippa Crerar.

Tories rally round ‘race row’ Lee Anderson #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/RMs0eFDag4— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) February 26, 2024   Sajjad Karim, a former Conservative MEP who chaired the European parliament’s working group on Islamophobia, has told the Guardian that Boris Johnson’s handling of an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party “ended up sending a signal to the party membership that was basically, Muslims are fair game”. Karim was speaking to Archie Bland, who has written this up in his First Edition newsletter.    Related: Tuesday briefing: Behind the Conservative party’s failure to address Islamophobia    Anderson has claimed that he is receiving “phenomenal support” over the comments about Sadiq Khan that led to him being suspended from the Conservative party. In an interview with GB News, where he works as a presenter, he said:   I know I’m not everybody’s cup of tea and I do speak in a different language to a lot of people in Parliament. When I went into pubs in Ashfield at the weekend, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, which I did, I got a round of applause and I went in. These are normal working class people. Some people over in that place (Westminster) might not like that sort of response, but this is what normal people are thinking in places like Ashfield. My inbox has exploded with support. I cannot keep up with my WhatsApp messages, my text messages, my Facebook messages, Instagram, whatever social media platform I’m on. The amount of support coming through is absolutely phenomenal.   Anderson said in the interview that he would not apologise to Khan, “not while I’ve got a breath in my body, because the comments I made weren’t racist at all”.   But, in his interview, Anderson did not restate his claim that Khan was under the control of Islamists. Instead he focused on a different allegation – that Khan had lost control of policing in London. He said:   I stick by my words in that we have lost control or losing control of the city. When people again and again can come out and demonstrate and shout murderous chants and put these graphics onto Big Ben, ‘from the river to the sea’ and nothing happens. We’ve got yobos running around with masks on, which is now illegal, and the police stand idly by and do nothing. Who has got control of Parliament Square? Is it the extremists or is it Mayor Khan and the Metropolitan police?   Anderson said that he had been on “a political journey”, declared that he wanted to stand again at the next election, and did not rule out joining Reform UK.  Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The Commons business committee starts a marathon evidence session about the Post Office Horizon scandal. Among the key witnesses are Alan Bates, who led the campaign for justice for former post office operators at 11am, Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, at 12pm, and Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, at 1pm. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.15pm: David Neal, who was sacked last week as the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee.

        "content": "Lee Anderson has said he did nothing wrong in saying Sadiq Khan was under the control of Islamists, claiming he had received overwhelming support from the public and MPs over comments that lost him the Conservative whip.\nIn his first media interviews beyond GB News, which employs him as a presenter, the former Tory vice-chair said that when he accused the London mayor, who is a Muslim, of giving London “to his mates”, those “in the real world” backed him.\nAnderson again refused to rule out defecting to Reform UK or contesting the next election as an independent, saying he would nonetheless definitely stand again for his Ashfield seat.\nGB News reported on Tuesday that Anderson had met Reform’s leader, Richard Tice, at a service station hotel in Derbyshire on Sunday for one-to-one talks.\nAnderson denied he had singled out Khan because he is Muslim, telling ITV News: “I didn’t think what religion he was, I just thought, I just think he’s a useless mayor who panders to this certain section of people.”\nThe media were, Anderson added, “suggesting that I picked on him because he’s Muslim and that’s, that’s a terrible thing to do”.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Rishi Sunak’s official spokesperson said it was “unacceptable to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism or the extreme ideology of Islamism”.\nAnderson said that while his words about Khan on GB News on Friday has been “a little bit clumsy”, he did not accept any fault. Asked by ITV if he believed his comments had been wrong in any way, the MP replied: “No, not at all.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSaying he had received “lots of support privately” from Conservative MPs, Anderson said the public also backed him: “I’ve got an email pinging in every 10 seconds in support, from not just my constituents, from all around the country. I think I’m on the right side of the argument on this – and history will judge me on this.”\nIn another interview, with Channel 5 News, Anderson refused to accept there was a difference between arguing that Khan had not properly controlled the policing of pro-Palestine demonstrations and that he was controlled by Islamists.\n“Maybe, maybe to you and the media, but have a walk around the real world, outside this bubble, and it speaks to people in my patch, who actually agree with what I’ve said,” Anderson said.\nHe argued that Sunak had made a mistake in removing the whip from him, but that he accepted the prime minister’s decision, telling ITV: “I don’t hold any malice towards him. He’s got a job. He is the boss, he’s the manager.”\nSaying he was “not prepared to discuss my political journey beyond this week”, Anderson refused to rule out joining Reform, the party formed by Nigel Farage, while telling Channel 5: “I will tell you this: whatever happens, my name will be on the ballot paper come the next election.”\nTice has previously said Anderson’s comments about Khan were “supported by millions of British citizens”. Reform’s deputy leader, Ben Habib, said any Tory MP wishing to join would need to explain themselves and the party would need to be sure they were “ideologically sound”.\nAnderson’s vehemence, coupled with his fondness for regular media appearances, not least on GB News, which pays him £100,000 a year, presents No 10 with an continuing controversy, one that threatens to split the Conservatives.\nWhile some Tories have been open in condemning Anderson for words they described as Islamophobic, others in the party argued he was justified in highlighting the wider issue of Islamist militancy.\nSunak and Downing Street have faced accusations of ignoring structural anti-Muslim feeling in the Conservatives by declining, before the spokesperson’s comments on Wednesday morning, to state whether Anderson’s comments had been potentially prejudiced.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the illegal migration minister, Michael Tomlinson, sent out on the morning broadcast round, had an interview on LBC radio abruptly terminated when the interviewer, Nick Ferrari, lost patience with his repeated refusal to elaborate on Anderson’s fault beyond saying his words had been “wrong”.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNo 10 has indicated that Anderson would regain the Conservative whip if he apologised, a course of action he was urged to take by James Cleverly, the home secretary.\n“I think Lee should apologise, what he said wasn’t accurate, it wasn’t fair, but the chief whip and the prime minister have made the party position absolutely clear on this,” Cleverly said during a trip to the US."

        "content": "Liz Truss made her remarks about having been hobbled by transgender and environmental activists in the civil service at a US event also attended by controversial rightwing figures, it has emerged. The former prime minister was criticised over the weekend when she told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland she had been thwarted during her 45-day term in office by a small cabal within Whitehall. It has now emerged that the roundtable event was also attended by a number of well-known figures from the fringes of global conservatism. They included Tommy Tuberville, a US senator who once refused to say white nationalists were racist, Hiroaki “Jay” Aeba, a representative of a conservative Japanese cult, and two allies of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. The revelations have intensified calls for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to remove the Tory whip from Truss, who is already under fire for not criticising Steve Bannon during a separate CPAC event during which the former Trump adviser called the far-right figure Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) a “hero”. Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow CabinetOffice minister, said: “It is anyone’s guess what Liz Truss thinks she is up to, but we now know that she is spending her time hanging out with a bizarre cast-list of far-right characters, while spreading conspiracy theories and refusing to challenge the idea Tommy Robinson is a ‘hero’. “That Rishi Sunak still hasn’t withdrawn the Tory whip from his predecessor shows how weak he is. By allowing her to bring these divisive, deluded and dangerous views into mainstream British politics, the Tory party is poisoning public discourse.” A spokesperson for Truss did not respond to a request for comment. Truss’s trip to CPAC – one of several visits she has made to the US since leaving office just over a year ago – has caused problems for her in the UK. She has faced criticism for appearing on a platform with Bannon, a far-right strategist, and for alleging that she had to resign because of a plot by the “deep state”. Her comments at the conference’s international summit were particularly controversial, where she told attenders: “People are joining the civil service who are essentially activists. They might be trans activists, they might be environmental extremists, but they are now having a voice within the civil service in a way I don’t think was true 30 or 40 years ago.” Video footage of the event shows Truss spoke after Nigel Farage, indicating the greater celebrity status of the former Ukip leader on the American right. Other speakers included Miklós Szánthó, the director of a rightwing thinktank in Hungary with close ties to Orbán, and Szabolcs Takács, the Hungarian ambassador to the US. The event was also addressed by Jay Aeba, a prominent Japanese conservative and representative of the Happy Science movement, whose followers regard their leader as the incarnation of a supreme being from Venus. In the audience was Tuberville, the US senator, who when asked during an interview last year whether white supremacists were racist, replied: “Well that’s your opinion.”"

        "content": "Labour has demanded an apology from Sadiq Khan’s Conservative opponent in the London mayoral election over comments and actions that led to her being accused of Islamophobia and racism. Susan Hall was also challenged in a letter from the Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, to commit to not using “any further Islamophobia or anti-Muslim hatred” as part of her election campaign in London. The intervention comes as the Conservatives come under mounting pressure over comments by the party’s former deputy chair, Lee Anderson, who had the party whip suspended on Saturday after he refused to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control” of Khan. Past comments and actions attributed to Hall, whose candidacy has been dogged by controversy over stances such as her support for Donald Trump, were listed in Dodds’s letter. They include: • Claiming that Jewish Londoners are “frightened” of Khan, which Labour described as a “divisive and Islamophobic dog-whistle”. • Endorsing a tweet from a far-right figure calling Khan the ”mayor of Londonistan”, a known Islamophobic trope. • Liking a reply to a tweet about Khan’s strategy to tackle violence against women and girls that said: “Well said Susan, that Labour Traitor RAT Likes that sort of thing”, in an apparent reference to female genital mutilation. Labour drew on material highlighted by the campaign group Hope Not Hate as part of an investigation into Hall. “Until you have provided an apology and much-needed clarity on your past statements – and until you have issued a full and unqualified condemnation of Lee Anderson’s comments as ‘racist’ and ‘Islamophobic’ – Londoners will be entitled to question your commitment to defeating not only anti-Muslim hatred, but all other forms of bigotry and racism,” Dodds wrote. Hall used an article published by the Standard on Monday to condemn “the monstrous abuse” Khan has faced, but Dodds said she had not gone far enough. In Hall’s Standard article, which was headlined “We Conservatives must criticise Sadiq Khan for his policies and politics, but never for his Muslim faith,” she did not mention Anderson by name. She wrote: “I may be one of Mayor Sadiq Khan’s biggest critics, but I also see the monstrous abuse he gets as one of the country’s most prominent Muslim politicians. No one should have to put up with that, and I wholly condemn anyone who does it, or fuels it. His faith is one of his positive characteristics, not something to be suspicious of.” A spokesperson for Hall said the Conservatives had “already responded” and pointed to the Standard article. Hall, a London assembly member, was the Conservatives’ surprise choice last year to take on Khan in this year’s mayoral election, in part because of her low profile, but also her hard-right views and strong support for Trump and Liz Truss. In its investigation into Hall last year, Hope Not Hate found that she had liked tweets praising Enoch Powell, as well as some containing Islamophobic abuse towards Khan. In February 2020, Hall liked a message on Twitter, now known as X, praising Powell, a former Conservative minister whose name became a byword for racism in UK politics after his notorious “rivers of blood” speech in 1968, which warned about immigration to the UK. The tweet depicted Powell with the words: “It’s never too late to get London back,” an apparent reference to the city’s multiculturalism. • This article was amended on 27 February 2024. An earlier version said that Enoch Powell said that immigration would lead to “rivers of blood”. In fact the speech is often referred to as the “rivers of blood speech” after a reference in it to Virgil’s Aeneid when Powell said: “As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see ‘the River Tiber foaming with much blood.’”"

        "content": "Lee Anderson has said he is not ruling out defecting to Reform UK, in a move that would give the rightwing populist party its first MP. Anderson, a former Conservative party deputy chair, who has been suspended from sitting as a Tory MP because of his comments about the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he had “been on a political journey” when pressed about whether he would join Reform. “You’ll say Lee Anderson rules out/doesn’t rule out joining the Reform party, so I’m making no comment on my future,” he said in his latest interview with his employer GB News. When asked if he would be a Conservative candidate at the next election, Anderson said: “That’s not up to me,” but that he would still be standing. Anderson, who was a deputy Tory chair until last month, was suspended from the party whip on Saturday after he refused to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control of” Khan. Anderson claimed on GB News that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”. He now sits as the independent MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire. Anderson might not be welcomed by all Reform UK senior figures. The party’s deputy leader, Ben Habib, said on Tuesday that any Tory MP wishing to join would need to explain themselves and the party would need to be sure they were “ideologically sound”. Anderson’s latest comments came as the home secretary, James Cleverly, called for him to apologise, but like other ministers and Rishi Sunak himself, continued to avoid describing Anderson’s comments as racist or Islamophobic. On a visit to San Francisco, Cleverly said: “I think Lee should apologise. What he said wasn’t accurate, it wasn’t fair, but the chief whip and the prime minister have made the party position absolutely clear on this.” Such an apology is unlikely to come, if other comments by Anderson to GB News are anything to go by. He insisted his comments “weren’t racist at all” and added that he would not apologise to Khan “while I have a breath in my body”. Anderson had some support from the Conservative MP and fellow GB News presenter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said Anderson’s comments about Khan had been “infelicitous” but he should not have been suspended. A former special adviser to No 10 on civil society and communities said Anderson’s comments would “stoke more division in our country during what is a very sensitive period”.   Related: ‘Can I now send the funds?’: secrets of the Conservative money machine   Samuel Kasumu, who was an adviser to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister, added on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the prime minister had Muslim colleagues who had expressed their concerns in private and public, and he quoted Martin Luther King: “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies.” The Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, also entered the row. A frequent speaker at the near-weekly marches against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, he said: “To paint the most moving act of the British people, the most peaceful, to paint them as Islamists, is Islamophobic anti-Palestinian and anti-British. “On those protests I saw mothers, grandmothers, Christians, Jewish people, brothers and sisters, and the British people at their best .” If Sunak had been hoping that the controversy would begin to die down three nights on from from the initial remarks, he is likely to be aghast at the emergence of a potential defection to Reform, which has been causing the Conservatives headaches in byelections and threatens to eat into Tory votes at the general election. Reform UK’s leader, Richard Tice, has not ruled out opening the door to Anderson after his suspension, and said on Twitter on Tuesday that he would not have removed the whip from Anderson. “Lee Anderson may have been clumsy in his precise choice of words, but his sentiments are supported by millions of British citizens, including myself,” he said in a statement. • This article was amended on 27 February 2024. An earlier version said that Lee Anderson’s Ashfield constituency was in Derbyshire instead of Nottinghamshire."

        "content": "Grassroots Conservative supporters have called Rishi Sunak a “snake” over Lee Anderson’s suspension as MPs on the Tory right said he should be given a route back in. In leaked WhatsApp messages obtained by the Guardian, members of the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO), which was founded by disgruntled Tories after Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss were ousted, attacked the prime minister for kicking Anderson out of the parliamentary party. Several of the activists endorsed Anderson’s comments and some went further in decrying “the threat of Islam”. Anderson, who was a deputy Tory chair until last month, was suspended from the party whip on Saturday after he refused to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control of” Sadiq Khan. Anderson claimed on GB News that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”. He now sits as the independent MP for Ashfield. Several Conservative MPs said on Monday they would like to see Anderson readmitted to their ranks if he apologised for his remarks. Jonathan Gullis, the Tory MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, told Times Radio: “I hope that we will see him return to that party sooner rather than later but of course he has to, I think, make that apology to Mayor Khan.” Another Tory MP said: “He wants to come back. We want him back.” The leaked CDO WhatsApp messages show the fury with which Anderson’s suspension was met by grassroots Tories, several of whom said they agreed with his comments. The CDO was created in December 2022 by the Tory donor and Johnson supporter Peter Cruddas and contains members of the party and non-members. It has had high-profile support from senior Tory politicians on the right, with Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries addressing its conference last May. After news of Anderson’s suspension broke, one activist on a CDO WhatsApp group for the south-east said it was “time for the snake of a PM to go.” Another called Sunak a “nutsak” and said “he should never have been there”. Several group members endorsed Anderson’s comments and expressed similar sentiments. “And everyone says Suella was exaggerating,” one activist said. “The government are now owned by fear of Islamic rule.” Another responded: “So right.” Another group member denounced Sunak as “weak and feeble” and said: “At an association AGM today, we were all asked to get behind Rishi Sunak. But I see now he’s fallen for a Labour attack on Lee Anderson which is a diversion of Keir Starmer’s ‘urging’/coercion of the speaker of the house last Wednesday.” Multiple activists expressed support for Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who wrote last week that “the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now”. One CDO member said: “She is saying the exact same thing as Lee Anderson, just in less colourful language, and importantly in print. I am beginning to believe that Suella is the only person who has shown the mettle who can turn the party and remove the threat of Islam from our country.” In a screenshot seen by the Guardian, this message was liked by 10 group members. In an echo of a speech that Braverman made in the US in September, James Cleverly, the home secretary, will on Tuesday call for global action to reform international laws governing migration. He plans to stress that people from developing countries seeking to move to the west should be encouraged to “stay and thrive at home”, comments which have been condemned by a refugee charity for failing to refer to the refugee convention and the right to claim asylum.  Members of the WhatsApp group shared a petition calling for Anderson’s reinstatement, with one person saying it had amassed 5,000 signatures overnight. Claire Bullivant of the Conservative Post, which launched the petition, said on Tuesday that it had surpassed 15,000 signatures. The messages demonstrate the activists’ degree of pessimism about their electoral chances in the general election. Several said Anderson’s suspension would repel voters who agreed with his views. “There goes Lee’s voters – wonder what happens when it dawns on them that they actually need voters to keep themselves in power,” one person said. Another remarked: “5 years of labour [sic] will concentrate minds, it’s the only way they will wake up unfortunately.” One group member shared a link to a “Lee Anderson Appreciation Group” on Facebook alongside the words: “In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act,” attributing them to George Orwell. In another WhatsApp group, for CDO members in London, there was speculation over whether Sunak might remove the Tory whip from Truss. David Campbell Bannerman, the former Tory MEP, told the group: “Truss mentioned – left pushing on it.” On Monday Anderson stood by his remarks, admitting they were “clumsy” but insisting they were “born out of sheer frustration at what is happening to our beautiful capital city”. He said in a statement: “If you are wrong, apologising is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. But when you think you are right, you should never apologise because to do so would be a sign of weakness.” Rishi Sunak repeatedly refused to describe Anderson’s comments as Islamophobic when pressed during interviews on Monday. “I’ve been very clear that what he said was wrong, it was unacceptable and that’s why we suspended the whip,” the prime minister told broadcasters in Yorkshire. “It’s important that everybody, but particularly elected politicians, are careful with their words and do not inflame tensions.” Sunak also declined to criticise Braverman, saying her comments “were not about an individual in particular”. In an article for the Evening Standard on Monday, Khan wrote that Sunak’s refusal to describe the comments as Islamophobic was “a tacit endorsement of anti-Muslim hatred and can only lead to the conclusion that anti-Muslim bigotry and racism are not taken seriously”. As pressure mounted on Sunak, the Conservative Muslim Forum, which is the party’s affiliated body for Muslim members, was in talks about meeting the Tory chair, Richard Holden, this week. Naveed Asghar, the deputy chair of the CMF, said: “Is the party racist or Islamophobic? I would say no, from my heart. Individuals? Yes. Are these people pandering to the vote base in their seats? I can’t see what’s going on. “If he is doubling down on the comments then the party should absolutely be having a word with him. I was hoping that the suspension would be enough. “Any inflammatory remarks are just not acceptable, whether it’s people on the left making antisemitic comments or people on the right making anti-Muslim comments.” Gavin Barwell, a peer and former chief of staff to Theresa May, said Anderson should not be allowed back into the parliamentary party until he made a genuine apology. “In terms of what happens next, I think if you were going to let anyone back in, you’d want to be convinced that an apology was genuine,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear that the language that was used, was used with the intent of stirring up religious hatred and division.” • This article was amended on 27 February 2024. The petition to reinstate Lee Anderson was organised by the Conservative Post website, not the Conservative Democratic Organisation as an earlier version said."

        "content": "Labour would help schools to train young male influencers who can counter the negative impact of people like Andrew Tate, the shadow education secretary has said.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Bridget Phillipson said that in order to combat sexual harassment, Labour wanted schools to develop role models who could provide a “powerful counterbalance” to Tate and others like him.\nTate is a self-professed “misogynist” influencer who has amassed 8.8 million followers on X, and has continued to use his platform even as he faces rape and human-trafficking charges in Romania.\nThe Labour party announced plans on Tuesday to help schools develop young male mentors and to teach pupils how to question the material they see on social media from people like Tate.\n“Young male mentors within schools would be a powerful counterbalance to some of the negativity that young men might be exposed to online,” Phillipson said. She expressed hopes that some of the young men who became leaders in their schools could then reach more people by becoming online influencers themselves.\n“I would hope that the young male mentors involved would then also be able to share their experiences more widely, to kind of shift the discussion around what it is to be growing up as a young man today in modern Britain,” Phillipson said.\nUnder the proposals, Labour would send “regional improvement teams” into schools to train staff on introducing the peer-to-peer mentoring programme.\n\n Related: ‘Andrew Tate is a symptom, not the problem’: why young men are turning against feminism \n\n“I do think it is incredibly important that, if we are going to tackle misogyny in our schools and in wider society, then we need to start making progress with children and young people,” Phillipson said.\n“It also has to be young men and young women alike; we can’t just leave it to young women to call out unacceptable behaviours or report issues that are happening. It’s really powerful if men all step in and make clear that kind of sexist or misogynistic behaviour is not acceptable, and they don’t tolerate it either.”\nPhillipson said schools should tackle the problem of Tate and other misogynistic influencers “head on” and talk to pupils about it.\n“I think there is a risk that sometimes we don’t give young people enough credit for already starting to understand some of what is out there. Pretending that this isn’t a problem is not the answer,” she said.\n“I do believe it’s important that young people have the ability to interrogate what’s in front of them, to have the kind of critical-thinking skills to assess what they’re seeing.”\nA Labour government would consider introducing lessons on how to spot disinformation as part of a wider review of the school curriculum.\n“It’s not simply about understanding how to use technology,” Phillipson said. “It’s about having the skills to question what’s in front of you, to challenge, to think, ‘Why is this being presented in a certain way?’”\n\n Related: How Finland starts its fight against fake news in primary schools \n\nPhillipson said her own children, aged seven and 11, did have smartphones but that she and her husband limited what they could see and how many hours they spent using them.\nShe did not back calls from some parents for children to be denied smartphones or to be banned from social media platforms until they were older.\n“It is difficult to turn the clock back now,” she said. “All parents, particularly parents with children at secondary school, will know that it’s essential to have some degree of online access because much of the homework has been set online.”\nPhillipson’s biggest focus is on childcare and early-years education, and she is drawing up an alternative to the current system of free childcare hours.\nLabour is considering creating nursery places inside existing primary schools and has tasked David Bell, the former permanent secretary at the Department of Education, with looking into different options.\n“We need better alignment between early-years education and the school system overall, so that they’re better joined together,” Phillipson said. “We are, at the moment, already starting to see schools with surplus classrooms. And I think that does present an opportunity for some creative thinking about how we can use that in the future.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPhillipson has visited Estonia, Ireland and Australia to look at how other countries provide childcare. She said in Estonia there was a strong connection between early-years provision and school “that means that they don’t experience the same gaps in attainment”.\nTeachers’ unions welcomed the proposals to tackle sexism and improve digital literacy in schools. Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said schools would welcome more support on how to respond to the online sexism and sexual harassment that young people encounter, describing it as an “overwhelming” and constantly changing challenge.\n“Using education to prevent sexist ideas and attitudes is vital – but only with a whole-school approach and an approach that’s supportive of schools,” he said.\nDr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, said its research had shown sexual harassment and sexist abuse towards female teachers and pupils in schools and colleges was commonplace, and that the majority of incidents were not reported or dealt with effectively.\n“Sexism and misogyny have no place in our schools and colleges, and it is vital that every action that can be taken is taken to stamp out such abuse,” he said.\nThe schools minister, Damian Hinds, said the mandatory relationships, sex and health education curriculum already included teaching on healthy relationships and online safety.\nHe added: “Our behaviour guidance helps schools stamp out inappropriate behaviour, social media firms are now required by law to protect children from harmful content online, and just last week, the education secretary took robust action by prohibiting the use of mobile phones in schools.”"

        "content": "How do you solve a problem like Lee? If you’re Rishi Sunak, then the answer is with the greatest reluctance. And extremely carefully. Lee Anderson is a man to be treated with kid gloves. To be loved back into a state of grace.\nIt would be a push to call Lee a national treasure. But he is certainly the closest the Conservative party has to a local hero. An MP far more popular among fellow Tories than Rishi or any of his cabinet colleagues. Viewers tune into his GB News programme to be drip-fed divine truths. For the unsayable to be made flesh. Lee is their beating heart.\nHow this came about is more of a mystery. Lee has been on quite the journey. He started life as a Labour councillor, making prejudiced remarks about Travellers before he jumped ship to the Tories. A party that would be more indulgent to his racism. And to the fact that he campaigned on behalf of Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 general election.\n\n Related: Lee Anderson: from Labour councillor to Labour wind-up merchant \n\nSince then, Lee has made a career out of hypocrisy and stupidity. First, he lashed out at fellow MPs who took second jobs. MPs should be content to serve their constituents on their parliamentary salary, he insisted, moments before signing a £100k-a-year deal to present his own show on GB News. He then turned out at the launch of the Popular Conservatives as their voice on climate change. Burning coal was just fine, he told us. Because coal came from trees and trees were green. Some people even applauded this nonsense.\nBut Lee doesn’t care if people think he’s stupid or racist. In fact, the more that people call him out, the more he likes it. It makes him feel good. Feeds his dysfunctionality. His overwhelming narcissism. More to the point, he binds all those supporters that the Tories like to pretend don’t exist but on whom they increasingly rely. So much so that the Conservative party chose to bung him an extra £10k a year. The only Brexit bonus anyone is likely to see.\n\n\nThe Conservative party chose to bung him an extra £10k a year: the only Brexit bonus anyone is likely to see.\n\n\nAnd it was all going so well until Lee went openly racist on his home news channel on Friday night and declared that Sadiq Khan had been taken over by Islamists and that London was now being run by terrorists. Take a trip on the Northern line and your train will be driven by a suicide bomber. Every bus was on its own personal jihad.\nNow you could say that Lee was unlucky. That he happened to deliver his rant at a time when someone was actually watching. Who knows how many other hate crimes he has committed that have gone unremarked. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?\nBut what had been heard could not now be unheard. And while there were plenty of Tories willing to attest that they had personally seen the London mayor take part in the 7 October terrorist attack, there were still a few who thought that maybe – just maybe – Anderson had gone too far this time.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThen up stepped brave Rish!. Or not. The prime minister was notably silent for 24 hours. Hoping that Lee would retract his statement. Say he had got it wrong this time. And that everyone could go back to being just a little bit racist this time. After all, racism-lite is the new acceptable face of Conservatism. But no. Still nothing. So Sunak was finally persuaded to withdraw the whip. With the clear understanding that Lee was still a figure of the divine. A human love pump. And was welcome back whenever he wanted.\nRish! was no more coherent when he gave a series of interviews to local radio stations in Yorkshire on Monday morning. What Lee had said was wrong, he said. But it definitely wasn’t racist or Islamophobic.\nEr … Run that past us again. Lee had done something wrong, but the wrong thing wasn’t racist or Islamophobic. So what was wrong about it? That he was actually far too nice? Sunak couldn’t explain. Other than it was a category error. The Tory party had no problem with Islamophobia or racism, so therefore Lee couldn’t have said anything wrong. Apart from the wrong thing he had said. We were rapidly going round in ever decreasing circles. Sunak’s Tory party is having the same problem with Islamophobia as Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour had with antisemitism.\n\n\nBrown-noser par excellence, Chris Philp ... had counted hundreds of terrorists on his way to work\n\n\nThat provided the cue for almost everyone to go slightly mad. Paul Scully, a Tory junior minister who is normally considered one of the saner members of the government, gave an interview in which he insisted that words mattered. Lee should apologise. Only for him then to say there were no-go areas in Birmingham. The terrorists were in control there, too. It’s a wonder any of us secular types get through the day without being beheaded.\nMeanwhile, Lee himself was loving it. Thrilled to still be the centre of attention. So he gave a statement to GB News, which he insisted another presenter read out for him, that doubled down on his racism. Even as Lee didn’t speak, Sadiq was in talks to turn the M25 into a mosque. Any motorist who wasn’t radicalised would not be allowed into the centre of London. The Ulez charge was funding Hamas.\n\n Related: Lee Anderson stands by attack on Sadiq Khan and launches fresh broadside \n\nNot to be outdone, the always idiotic Jonathan Gullis accused the speaker of also radicalising most of his Stoke constituents. Suella Braverman went further. The whole of the establishment were now terrorists. When she looked around the cabinet table, she couldn’t be sure that one of her colleagues wasn’t about to blow up the room.\nThen there was the brown noser par excellence, Chris Philp. He, too, had counted hundreds of terrorists on his way to work. You could always spot a terrorist, he said. They were the ones who had nothing but contempt for the planning laws. The holy writ of the green belt. It’s possible that the Philpster is actually more stupid than 30p Lee. At least Lee doesn’t pretend to be anything but dim.\nEven Tom Tugendhat, who wouldn’t look out of place in a Keir Starmer cabinet, couldn’t bring himself to call out Lee. What he had said was wrong, but he couldn’t squeeze out the word Islamophobia. Come the early evening news, Rish! was at it again. The Tory party definitely, definitely didn’t have a problem with Islamophobia. It was just a total coincidence that everywhere he looked there were men with swords yelling ‘Allahu Akbar’. And that was just the leadership team of the Bank of England."

        "content": "The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has rejected an SNP request for a further Gaza ceasefire vote after last week’s angry scenes at Westminster amid concerns that it could be a further breach of parliamentary protocol. The SNP had asked for a vote on a “substantive” motion on whether there should be an immediate ceasefire after the speaker said last week that he would be willing to consider an emergency debate. However, the Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell is understood to be making a Commons statement on the Gaza conflict on Tuesday which, under parliamentary protocol, would be prioritised over the SNP request. Hoyle’s decision brought a number of new signatures to a motion expressing no confidence in the speaker, with 80 MPs now backing the call for him to step down, and accusations that he had “broken his word” over promises of another debate on Gaza. SNP insiders had argued there was a precedent for an emergency debate to conclude with a vote on a substantive motion, which would give MPs the chance to explicitly call on the government to actively pursue an end to the Israel-Gaza conflict. The former speaker John Bercow allowed more than a dozen such debates during the passage of Brexit through parliament, although the move prompted fury among some Tory MPs who argued that it was a breach of protocol.   Related: If this tawdry affair ends with a red card for the Commons ref Sir Lindsay Hoyle, it will not reflect well on our MPs | Andrew Rawnsley   The motion put forward by the SNP was not neutral, instead saying that Israel is engaged in “collective punishment” against the Palestinians and urging ministers to end arms contracts with the Israelis and take other “tangible” measures, including votes on the UN security council, to achieve an immediate ceasefire. Hoyle told MPs that he had been advised by Commons clerks that emergency debates should be “neutral”, meaning MPs just “take note” of an issue. He had the support of all four of his deputy speakers. “In determining whether a matter is urgent, I must have regard to the probability of the matter being brought before the house in time by other means. The house came to a resolution on this matter on Wednesday last week,” he said. “Further, I understand the government is ready to make a relevant statement tomorrow so there is a very imminent opportunity for this important matter to come before the house.” Last Wednesday he was left fighting for his political career after he broke with precedent – against the advice of his officials – to allow a vote on a Labour amendment to the SNP’s motion on Gaza amid concerns over MPs’ safety. The next day he apologised and offered an emergency debate, saying: “I regret it. I apologise to the SNP … I apologise and I apologise to the house. I made a mistake. We do make mistakes. I own up to mine.” Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said Hoyle’s decision to reject a further vote called into question the trust placed in him.  “Last week the speaker of the House of Commons broke the rules, this week he has broken his word,” he said. “I would imagine that parliamentarians across the chamber will be deeply concerned about the fact that the speaker of the House of Commons has made a clear and unambiguous statement, stating that he would have a debate and a vote in relation to the situation in Gaza, and that he has instead opted not to do that.” Momentum to oust Hoyle appears to have slowed since his apology, with only four MPs adding their names on Friday and a further nine signing it after Flynn’s intervention on Monday. There was no indication from the government that it would be willing to allow a confidence vote, while several senior Tories have come out in his defence. After his announcement in the Commons, some Tory MPs offered the speaker words of support and pats on the shoulder as they left the chamber. Hoyle had argued last week that allowing a vote on Labour’s amendment meant MPs could express their views on the “widest range of propositions”, helping to protect them from threats to their safety amid heightened scrutiny over their stance on the conflict. However, the decision meant Labour avoided a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the SNP’s ceasefire call, which went further than Labour’s by calling for an end to the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people”. This led to accusations – denied by the party and the speaker – that Labour had put pressure on him over the decision. "

Paul Scully, the former minister for London, has been criticised for saying there are areas in London and Birmingham, “parts of Tower Hamlets, for example” and parts of Birmingham Sparkhill, that have become “no-go areas”. He made the comment in a radio interview where he was talking about the concerns people have about neighbourhoods changing.

The SNP has accused Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, of breaking his promise to allow an emergency debate on Gaza. (See 4pm.)   Britain’s stretched public services will buckle under the weight of the spending cuts being planned for after the election, economists have warned, as Jeremy Hunt prepares for another round of tax reductions in next week’s budget.      6.04pm GMT  Shapps tells MPs US/UK airstrikes have 'eroded Houthi capacity', but not their intent to continue attacks on shipping  Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, told the Commons this afternoon that US and UK airstrikes in Yemen had “eroded Houthi capacity” to attack western shipping in the aftermath of a fourth round of attacks on Saturday night. However, despite the latest round of bombing, the minister conceded in an update for MPs that Houthi “intent to prosecute indiscriminate attacks against innocent vessels remains undiminished” – suggesting further Anglo-American attacks could come in future. The defence secretary highlighted there were four recent attacks by the Houthis on merchant shipping in the past few days, including an attack on the MV Rubymar, a Belize-flagged, UK-owned bulk carrier that caused an 18-mile oil slick in the Red Sea. Such Houthi targeting of commercial vessels justified the latest joint US-UK bombing, Shapps said. RAF Typhoons attacked eight times on Saturday knocking out “five one-way attack drones” at a site near Sana’a, the minister said, and hitting three more buildings at Banni, a launch site struck on two previous occasions. The minister added that “consideration [was] given to minimising any risk of causing civilian casualties” and that previous rounds of RAF bombing are not thought by the UK to have killed any non-combatants. Eighteen targets were struck in Saturday night’s bombing, the last wave in a campaign that began on 11 January     5.39pm GMT   The Green party has joined those criticising Rishi Sunak for refusing to describe Lee Anderson’s comments about Sadiq Khan as Islamophobic. In a statement Adrian Ramsay, the party’s co-leader, said:  It is deeply concerning that neither Rishi Sunak nor his deputy have felt able to condemn the obnoxious Islamophobic remarks made by Lee Anderson, that mirrored remarks made earlier by the former home secretary Suella Braverman.  It is worth noting that the comments made by Anderson came on the same day that Tell MAMA, a national service supporting victims of anti-Muslim hate, announced that there had been a 335% increase in anti-Muslim hate cases since 7 October last year.       5.31pm GMT  Starmer claims Sunak refusing to denounce Islamophobia in Tory party 'because he's so weak'  Keir Starmer has claimed that Rishi Sunak is refusing to denounce Islamophobia in the Conservative party because he’s too weak. In a clip for broadcasters, he said that   I think this is straightforward. It’s Islamophobia and the prime minister should call it out for what it is. The reason he won’t is because he is so weak. They are divided, chaotic and if they are re-elected we are going to have five more years of this.      5.24pm GMT   The Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis has said that he hopes Lee Anderson has the Tory whip restored soon. Referring to an incident he raised at Home Office questions (see 3.34pm), Gullis said:  I hope that we will see him return to that party sooner rather than later but of course, he has to, I think, make that apology to Mayor Khan. I think the point he was making was about Islamist extremism, which sadly does prevail in our community, and I saw that on Friday in Stoke on Trent, where we had former members. At the very least, we know their former of Hizb ut-Tahrir, heckling, intimidating, harassing Stoke on Trent Conservatives at a local fundraiser.   Updated at 10.49am GMT    5.14pm GMT  Sunak says he is sure Liz Truss does not agree with Steve Bannon about Tommy Robinson being a hero  Rishi Sunak has said that he is sure Liz Truss does not regard the far-right activist Tommy Robinson as a hero. He was speaking in response to video that has circulated widely on social media showing the former prime minister in the US last week failing to challenge Steve Bannon when he described Robinson as a hero because of his response to child grooming scandal. Instead Truss agreed with the broader point made by Bannon, a far-right political strategist and former adviser to President Trump, which was alarm at the prospect of a pro-Palestinian candidate (George Galloway) winning the Rochdale byelection.  Liz Truss tells Steve Bannon that a \"radical Islamic party\" could win the Rochdale by-election and and then says nothing as he describes Tommy Robinson as a \"hero\". pic.twitter.com/dZ8daApupL— Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) February 23, 2024  In an interview with 5 News, asked about Truss not challenging Bannon’s description of Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and who has convictions for fraud, assault, stalking, using threatening behaviour and contempt of court, Sunak replied:  I’m sure Liz Truss does not agree with Steve Bannon on that point … She was on a panel, you know, I don’t know exactly what happened, but obviously I would imagine that she does not agree with those comments that were made.  In his interview Sunak again refused to described what Lee Anderson said about Sadiq Khan as Islamophobic. Andy Bell from 5 News put it to Sunak that not using the term was part of the problem. He quoted this point made by Sayeeda Warsi, the former Conservative party chair, who said at the weekend:  If you can’t call racism racism, if you can’t call antisemitism antisemitism, and if you can’t call Islamophobia Islamophobia, then how are we going to fix it?  Sunak replied:  I’ve been very clear, that any form of prejudice or racism is completely and utterly unacceptable. That’s not who we are as a country. We’re a proud multi-ethnic democracy, one of the most successful anywhere in the world.   Updated at 5.34pm GMT    4.46pm GMT  Chancellor gave Fujitsu executive advice on gaining contracts  Jeremy Hunt gave advice at a Conservative fundraiser to a senior Fujitsu executive who lobbied him in relation to government spending on AI and supercomputers, according to released emails, Ben Quinn reports.   Related: Chancellor gave Fujitsu executive advice on gaining contracts       4.38pm GMT   Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, is now making a Commons statement about the Post Office Horizon scheme. He says the government wants to introduce legislation “as soon as possible next month” to exonerate post officer operators believed to have been wrongfully convicted. In a Commons written statement last week he set out some details of what the legislaton will say. Tomorrow Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, Nick Read, the current chief executive, and Alan Bates, the leader of the group campaigning for justice for post officer operators, are among witnesses giving evidence to the Commons business committee on this topic. In advance of that hearing, the committee has this afternoon published a tranche of documents it has received from the Post Office in response to its requests for informaton.     4.19pm GMT  Charity Commission boss says he will not let it be 'weaponised' by politicians wanting to fight culture wars  The chair of the Charity Commission, Orlando Fraser, has re-iterated his determination to resist pressure from media and politicians fighting culture wars to crack down on so-called “woke” or “political” charities. Speaking at the launch of the commission’s new five year strategy in Waterloo, London, this morning he said charities often found themselves in “fierce public battles for the soul of our nation”, finding themselves as a consequence “at the biting edge of what we have come to know as the culture wars.” He added:  I will not allow the commission to be misused or weaponised by any army involved in fighting these wars. Whether it be led by powerful interests in politics, the media, or indeed the sector itself.  It is not the first time Fraser, a lawyer and one-time Tory parliamentary candidate, has insisted that charities have a legal right to campaign and get involved in political (but not party political) issues – and that the commission will defend that right. In recent years Tory MPs and rightwing media have attacked and demanded the watchdog investigate several high profile charities they have accused of, variously, being woke or leftwing – notably the National Trust, and Barnardo’s. In each case the commission inquired into the claims, and exonerated the charities. It remains to be seen whether the commission’s determination to take tough stand on this issue will make charity trustees feel any more confident of speaking out or campaigning if they worry they will be targeted by often aggressive and abusive scrutiny of culture-warriors, even if it is their legal right to do so.     4.15pm GMT  Humza Yousaf calls for inquiry into 'structural Islamophobia' in Tory party  Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has called for an investigation into “structural Islamophobia” in the Conservative party. Describing Lee Anderson’s comments about Sadiq Khan as “a further demonstration of the fact that Islamophobia is normalised” in the party, Yousaf said:  You can look at any one of the tweets that I put out, or any one of the social media posts I put out, and you will see streams of Islamophobic abuse. The fact that an MP thinks it is acceptable to make such Islamophobic comments against anybody, let alone the mayor of London, I think is despicable. I think the Conservative party should be investigating what, I think, is clearly structural Islamophobia within that party.  Yousaf, who is the first Muslim to lead a country in western Europe, said that Anderson should have been expelled from the Conservative party, not just suspended.     4.00pm GMT  SNP says Hoyle has 'broken his word' by not allowing emergency debate on Gaza  Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, has accused Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, of breaking his promise to allow an emergency debate on Gaza. In a statement responding to the speaker’s statement (see 3.49pm), Flynn said:  Yet again, Westminster is failing the people of Gaza by blocking a vote on the urgent action the UK government must take to help make an immediate ceasefire happen.For months, the UK parliament has blocked SNP calls for an immediate ceasefire – and now it’s blocking a vote on the concrete actions the UK government must pursue to make an immediate ceasefire more likely … It’s regrettable that this inexplicable decision will further erode trust in the speaker. The speaker broke the rules last week – and this week he has broken his word. How can MPs have any trust in the speaker when he makes a public commitment one minute, only to rip it up the next. If 30,000 dead Palestinians aren’t worthy of an emergency debate – what is?  Collectively the SNP has decided it no longer has confidence in the speaker because of what happened last week. There are now 77 MPs who have signed the Commons early day motion expressing no confidence in Hoyle, up from 71 at the end of last week.  Updated at 4.27pm GMT    3.49pm GMT  Speaker confirms he has turned down application from SNP for emergency debate on Gaza  In the Commons Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, is making a point of order. He says the SNP tried in good faith to have debate under standing order 24 to have another debate on Gaza. (See 12.11pm.) He says he has been told that request has been refused. Why is that? Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, tells Flynn standing orders say the speaker should not say why he has turned down a request for an SO24 debate. But in these circumstances he will give an explanation, he says. He says two factors determine whether an SO24 debate is granted. First is the extent to which the subject is a matter for ministers. He says that in this case the matter does not relate to areas of ministerial responsibility. (Hoyle does not explain, but the SNP motion is about the case for a ceasefire in Gaza, which is not directly a matter for the UK government.) And Hoyle says the second factor is whether or not MPs are likely to discuss this issue by another means. In this case, MPs came to a resolution on Gaza only last week, he says. And he says ministers are expected to make a statement on Gaza to the Commons tomorrow. He says that is why he is turning the application down. This does not mean MPs cannot apply for another emergency debate in future, when circumstances may have changed, he says.  Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.36pm GMT       3.34pm GMT  Tory MP Jonathan Gullis claims pro-Palestinian 'hate mob' emboldened by events in Commons during Gaza debate  Earlier during Home Office questions Jonathan Gullis (Con) said a pro-Palestinian hate mob appeared outside a Conservative party fundraising event on Friday. He said a police officer allowed protesters into the building to intimidate people. One of the people involved used to be member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, the now-proscribed Islamist group, he said. And he claimed that what happened in the Commons last week “emboldened these individuals to take the action they did”.  Chris Philp, the policing minister, said no MP should feel they have to change their vote, or change procedure, because of external pressure. What happened in Stoke was unacceptable, he said. He said he was pleased to be able to tell MPs that four people have now been arrested in connection with the incident in Stoke.     3.25pm GMT   At Home Office question Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, asks if any minister in the department has been willing to say Lee Anderson’s comments were Islamophobic. Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, is responding. He says Labour should have suspended its Rochdale candidate as quickly over his antisemitism as the government did over Lee Anderson. Cooper criticises Tugendhat for not being able to identify and speak out against Islamophobia. Tugendhat says anti-Muslim hatred is wrong, and must be dealt with.     3.21pm GMT  Labour MP Dawn Butler says she's suffered far-right abuse 'inspired in part' by 'hate' peddled by Anderson, Braverman and Truss  It is Home Office questions in the Commons, and Labour’s Dawn Butler said she had had to get extra police support this weekend due to the far-right abuse she had suffered, inspired in party by the “hate” peddled by Lee Anderson, Suella Braverman and Liz Truss. She said:  I’ve had to seek extra police support this weekend due to the far-right abuse that I have suffered, inspired and unleashed in part by the conspiracy theory, the racist Islamophobic, anti-Muslim hate peddled by [Anderson, Braverman and Truss].  The speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, reprimanded her for naming individuals. Butler referred to members of the governing party, and asked if other government MPs should have the whip withdrawn. Chris Philp, the policing minister who was responding, said that Anderson had been suspended, and that his party had acted more quickly than Labour did when it emerged its candidate in Rochdale had made antisemitic remarks in private.     2.48pm GMT  UK Green party leaders hold joint press conference to highlight damage caused by Tory/Labour net zero reversals  Conservative and Labour policy shifts on net zero have hit investment and angered voters, leaders of the various Green parties from across the UK have said in a rare joint press event. Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, the co-leaders of the Greens in England and Wales, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, their equivalents in Scotland, and Anthony Slaughter, who leads the semi-separate Greens in Wales, gathered in London for an event intended to persuade voters of the benefits of a vote for the party in the general election. Malachai O’Hara, leader of the Greens in Northern Ireland, was meant to have also spoken but was delayed. While the Greens nationally remain stuck on about 7% polling, the party has an ambitious target of four MPs, up from the current one, based around highly focused campaigning and the energies of their councillor base, which has doubled since the 2019 election. The mass event also allows the Greens to stress the experience of their Scottish party in government, with Hervie and Slater serving as ministers in the devolved SNP-led government since 2021. In his speech, Harvie, whose brief covers zero carbon buildings and active travel, said the shift to net zero “will require serious investment to change the way we travel the way you treat our homes”. He added:   But every time the UK government cuts another scheme or rolls back on net zero, it undermines investor confidence in this country as a place for green investment.  Speaking to the Guardian after the speeches, Denyer said many voters in Bristol, where she is competing against Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire in the new Bristol Central constituency, were upset with Labour for watering down their £28bn a year green investment plan. “They are proactively bringing that up with me on the doorstep before I even mention it,” she said. The Greens’ best electoral bets appear to be Brighton Pavilion, where Sian Berry is seeking to follow Caroline Lucas as the Green MP; Bristol Central, where local polling shows Labour and the Green neck and neck; and Waveney Valley, straddling Norfolk and Suffolk, a brand new seat where Ramsay hopes to spring a surprise on the Conservatives. They are also targeting the seat of North Herefordshire. The tendency thus far for both the Conservatives and Labour to stress caution on public spending, green investment and other fiscal matters, had created a vacancy, Denyer said. She explained:  People are looking for hope. That’s what they are saying, either explicitly or implicitly, when they speak to me on the doorstep – neither the Conservatives nor Labour are offering an alternative but neither are they offering hope, or action towards that. And that’s what the Greens offer.      2.35pm GMT  Sunak defends suspending Lee Anderson but not Braverman over their anti-Islamist comments  Rishi Sunak has defended his party’s decision to suspend Lee Anderson for saying Sadiq Khan and London are under the control of Islamists, but not to suspend Suella Braverman for suggesting that Islamists are in charge of the whole of the UK. In her article for the Telegraph last week Braverman, the former home secretary, said: “The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now.” Asked about Braverman’s article, Sunak told broadcasters in Yorkshire:  I think that those comments were not about an individual in particular. There is a broader point that some of the scenes that we have been witnessing on our streets in recent times are unacceptable. And we’re now having a situation where, whether it’s private MPs’ meetings, council meetings, or indeed what happened to in parliament last week, where the normal democratic processes that we are used to in this country are being impacted, threatened, disrupted aggressively and in an intimidating fashion. I don’t think that’s right. I don’t think anyone thinks that that’s right. And I think it’s important that we call out that kind of behaviour as wrong and that we do everything we can to stamp it out.  Although Braverman’s article was about the influence of Islamists in general, it did include a line saying Keir Starmer was “in hock to the Islamists”.  Updated at 2.51pm GMT    2.21pm GMT  SNP calls for investigation into Labour's efforts to get speaker to allow vote on its Gaza amendment last week  The SNP has called for an independent investigation into what Labour did to stop the SNP’s Gaza motion being put to a vote in the debate last week. It has already been established that Keir Starmer personally lobbied Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, on this issue, shortly before it started. Under normal rules the SNP motion would have been put to a vote first, but Hoyle broke with precedent and allowed a vote on the Labour amendment, which came first. Some Labour MPs made interventions in the Commons chamber designed to delay the start of the debate, to allow more time for colleagues to persuade Hoyle to ignore the conventional rules. One of them was Chris Bryant, who gave a speech opposing a 10-minute rule bill motion and called for a vote on it, holding up proceedings for about 20 minutes. In an interview with Channel 4 News yesterday, asked if he was doing at his own initiative or because he had been asked to by the party, Bryant replied: “A bit of both, if I’m honest.” The SNP’s Kirsty Blackman said:  Starmer’s party has been caught red handed following the admission by Chris Bryant. There must now be a full, independent investigation into the appalling behaviour of Keir Starmer and his colleagues, who are no better than the Tories when it comes to manipulating the broken Westminster system.  Labour has accepted that it did make a case to Hoyle as to why he should make an exception to the normal procedure last Wednesday. But it has denied threatening the speaker, and what Bryant was doing last week was within the rules. In a post on X the SNP Alison Thewliss says Bryant criticised filibustering in his recent book on parliament, but the extract she quotes is about filibustering being used to block private members’ bills, which is not what Bryant was doing. When Hoyle decided to ignore precedent in this case, he clearly expected that there would be a vote on the SNP motion after the vote on the Labour amendment, which he expected to fail. But the SNP motion was never put to a vote because the government chose not to vote against the Labour proposal, reportedly because government whips feared if there was a division, they would lose.     1.42pm GMT  Richard Tice urges Lee Anderson to join Reform UK, saying he speaks for millions 'appalled by what's happening' to Britain  Richard Tice, leader of Reform UK, has said that Lee Anderson was speaking for millions of people “appalled by what is happening to our country” in what he said about Islamists and Sadiq Khan. In a statement suggesting he hopes Anderson will join Reform UK, Tice said:  Lee speaks for millions of people who are appalled by what is happening to our country. Between them, this gutless government and the Mayor of London appear to have lost control of our streets. The projecting of a vile antisemitic slogan on our Houses of Parliament last week is a shocking illustration of the breakdown of law and order. In his role as London’s police and crime commissioner, Sadiq Khan is responsible for London’s security. Along with Sir Mark Rowley, he has totally failed in that capacity. Week in week out, he and the police have allowed pro-Hamas, hate-filled antisemitic marches to continue … Lee Anderson may have been clumsy in his precise choice of words, but his sentiments are supported by millions of British citizens, including myself. Never has Westminster and the craven left leaning establishment been so out of touch with ordinary people. I do not and will not give a running commentary on any discussions I have with any MPs, but those MPs have my number.  Reform UK, which used to be the Brexit party, was founded by Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, and he remains its honorary president (and owner – it’s a company, and he reportedly owns a majority of the shares). At the weekend Farage said that Anderson would be “a massive help to the cause” and that he would “probably feel happier” in Reform UK than in the Conservative party. But Farage was not so complimentary when interviewed by Decca Aitkenhead for the Sunday Times for an interview published earlier this month. Referring to Anderson resigning as deputy Tory chair to vote against the government on Rwanda bill amendments, but not voting against the bill at third reading, Aitkenhead writes:  Farage wouldn’t vote for a single serving Tory MP. “A bunch of charlatans and liars.” What about his friend and GB News colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg? “Oh, he’s a very nice bloke, but he’ll always do the wrong thing in the end.” Lee Anderson’s vote for the Rwanda Bill provokes a snort of contempt. “I thought he was a miner. I thought miners were tough.”      1.20pm GMT  No 10 urges politicians not to 'inflame debate', but won't criticise Braverman over Telegraph article saying Starmer 'in hock to Islamists'  The Downing Street lobby briefing was largely taken up with questions about Lee Anderson. Given that this row strays into party politics (the PM’s spokesperson is a civil servant, and leaves the party political briefing to a special adviser), and given that Rishi Sunak has already spoken about this himself (see 8.26am), the No 10 comments did not add a lot to what is already on the record. But here are the newish lines.  No 10 restated Sunak’s belief that what Lee Anderson said was “wrong”, but was reluctant to explain what aspect of his statement was objectionable. Asked to say specifically what it was that Anderson did that was wrong, the spokesperson replied:   As the PM said this morning, he made comments which were wrong.  Asked to say which parts of Anderson’s comments were wrong, and why, the spokesperson replied:  You’ve got the language that he used. His comments were wrong in their entirety … He made comments which you will have seen, and obviously there has been significant reaction to. The choice of those words were wrong, particularly in the current climate, where tensions are heightened. As the PM said this morning, it’s really important … that people in public office do not seek to inflame debates in a harmful way.  Sunak and other ministers have been reluctant to say that Anderson’s comments were racist.  The spokesperson did not explicitly criticise Suella Braverman for what she said in her Telegraph article last week. When it was put to him that Lee Anderson was asked to apologise for saying Sadiq Khan was being controlled by Islamists, but Braverman has not been asked to apologise for saying Keir Starmer was “in hock” to them”, the spokesperson said he did not have anything to add to what Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, said about Braverman at the weekend. (Dowden said her language did not require an apology because it did not cross a line.) But the spokesperson went on:   More broadly, the PM urge all politicians in public life to seek to take the heat out of the tension and not to inflame the debate.  In her article Braverman said:  On a day when Keir Starmer should have shown strength of character, he bowed to the mob, abused his position, and undermined the integrity of parliament. Conventions cast aside, the speaker’s legitimacy destroyed, and democracy denied. Trust was shattered by Starmer’s grubby backroom deal. The mask has slipped: in hock to the Islamists, he is responsible for one of the most shameful days of our democracy.   The spokesperson said the government is not happy with the APPG definition of Islamophobia that Labour says it should accept (see 10.14am) because it “conflates race with religion”. The spokesperson said:   As the government has stated previously, there are issues in relation to the APPG’s definition of Islamophobia, which conflates race with religion, does not address sectarianism within Islam, and may unintentionally undermine freedom of speech. But as I’ve said, we have always been clear that this government does not and will not tolerate anti-Muslim hatred.      12.31pm GMT  Lee Anderson defends anti-Khan diatribe, saying 'when you're right, you should never apologise', but accepts wording 'clumsy'  Lee Anderson has suggested that he won’t be apologising to Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London for saying he is under the control of Islamists (see 8.01am) because the comment is accurate. In an interview with GB News (where he works as a presenter), the former Conservative party deputy chair said:  If you are wrong, apologising is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. But when you think you are right you should never apologise because to do so would be a sign of weakness.  Anderson also released a statement he drafted on Saturday accepting that some of his wording may have been “clumsy” but defending the substance of what he said. According to GB News, the statement was not released at the weekend because Anderson refused a request from the Tory chief whip, Simon Hart, to apologise for what he said. In his statement Anderson said:  Hundreds of people had been arrested for racist abuse on these marches and we barely hear a peep from the mayor. If these marches were about something less fashionable Sadiq Khan would have been the first to call for them to be cancelled. It’s double standards for political benefit … Seeing the words ‘From the river to the sea’ on Elizabeth Tower made me feel sick to the pit of my stomach. Khan has stood by and allowed our police to turn a blind eye to the disgusting scenes around parliament. I It is not my intention to upset anyone, I believe in free speech and have 100 per cent respect for people of all backgrounds. The vast majority of Muslims are not Islamists in the same way the vast majority of Christians are not conservatives or socialists. The vast majority of our Muslim friends in the UK are decent, hardworking citizens who make an amazing contribution to our society and their religion should not be blamed for the actions of a tiny minority of extremists. My words may have been clumsy but my words were borne out of sheer frustration at what is happening to our beautiful capital city.      12.11pm GMT  SNP calls for fresh Commons Gaza vote, on motion to mandate government to push for immediate ceasefire at UN  As Libby Brooks reports, the SNP is pushing for another Commons vote on a Gaza ceasefire this week – but this time one that would actually mandate the government to act.   Related: SNP to push for another Commons vote on ceasefire in Gaza   In a statement explaining what the party wants, Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said:  The SNP wants to move the debate forward with a fresh motion that focuses on the specific, practical, concrete steps the UK government must now take to help make an immediate ceasefire happen.As a key ally and defence trading partner of Israel, and a member of the UN security council, the UK has an important role to play - but the UK government, which still opposes even calling for an immediate ceasefire, is not doing anywhere near enough to secure one.The SNP has a plan to change that. We’ve reached out to the other parties offering talks on a fresh SNP motion, so parliament can finally mandate the UK government to act.  SNP and public pressure forced Sir Keir Starmer to U-turn on his opposition to calling for an immediate ceasefire – and now MPs across parties must work together to get Rishi Sunak to do the same.The SNP wants parliament to mandate the UK government to use its position on the UN security council to vote for an immediate ceasefire, and follow the advice of independent UN experts to halt all transfers of military equipment and technology, including components, to Israel, and to suspend the issuing of new licences.  The SNP is very unlikely to get its way on this. Partly that is because foreign policy is generally viewed as a matter for government, not for parliament, and there are relatively view votes in the Commons that “mandate” the government on foreign policy. And partly its because, in so far as there is a consensus on parliament, it is probably lined up more behind the Labour position, as set out in its motion last week, than behind the SNP position. The speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has offered the SNP an emergency debate under standing order 24. Another problem for the SNP is that SO24 debates are normally held on neutral motions, not substantive ones that could mandate government. As Sam Blewett points out in this morning’s London Playbook briefing for Politico, there is an exception to this rule – but not on that Hoyle is likely to want to follow. Blewett explains:  There is, of course, one big exception to this norm — one that will be distinctly unappealing to Hoyle. His predecessor John Bercow, in his precedent-shredding pomp of September 2019, broke with convention to grant MPs a vote on a substantive motion under SO24 rules. This allowed backbench MPs to take control of Commons business in order to push through legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit. And we all remember how smoothly that went… What are the chances? The Sunday Times reported that Hoyle has already been warned by senior Tories that granting the SNP a substantive vote would be another, unwelcome departure from protocol. And Hoyle has long vowed not to permit the sort of Commons chicanery allowed under Bercow. Further riling the SNP therefore seems the most likely outcome of today’s negotiations — unless a third way can be found to give the nationalists a chance to re-run their botched debate.    Updated at 12.32pm GMT    11.46am GMT  Under Tories buying a home has turned into 'fantasy' option for many people, Starmer claims  Keir Starmer is doing an event today to promote Labour’s plans to encourage housebuilding, which are part of the party’s growth mission. In a statement released in advice, Starmer said that under the Tories the prospect of being able to buy their own home has become “a fantasy” for many people. He said:  Britain’s workers and Britain’s interests have been failed. Living standards have plummeted, as has the traditional British belief that if you work hard, it pays. For too many people a higher wage is beyond reach, and buying a home has become a fantasy. My mum and dad enjoyed the stability of a home they owned and a faith that their kids would have more opportunity than they did. And it wasn’t just them, its engrained in the British psyche – you work hard, you can get on. Work will pay. Life will give you chances.  The Conservative party’s economic choices run completely against those values. Meanwhile, their promises on levelling up are empty. The Tories aren’t just betting the house, they’re betting yours.  It’s time for change. My Labour government will be different. We’ll run a patriotic economy where Britain’s interest is centre stage, and Britain’s hard working families reap the rewards.      11.33am GMT   Some Conservatives condemned Lee Anderson after his claim on Friday about Sadiq Khan being under the control of Islamists, and welcomed the party’s decision to withdraw the whip from him. But other Tories have privately expressed concern about the party’s decision to discipline him, and the Daily Telegraph this morning has splashed on a story about the backlash being articulated in a WhatsApp group for MPs from the 2019 intake.  The Daily Telegraph: Red Wall revolt over Anderson sacking #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/LmUSSEoaKz— George Mann (@sgfmann) February 25, 2024  In their story, which takes in material revealed by Sky’s Sam Coates, Genevieve Holl-Allen and Ben Riley-Smith report:  Some of the messages were posted on Saturday on “The 109”, the name of a WhatsApp group for Tory MPs first elected in 2019, although it also includes a few MPs from other intakes. Jill Mortimer, the Tory MP for Hartlepool – a seat won from Labour in 2021 – shared a voter email that said: “Today’s news of Lee Anderson’s suspension has been the final nail in your party’s coffin.” The MP asked colleagues: “Anyone else getting these in?” Sarah Dines, the MP for the Derbyshire Dales, said: “Loads. From random constituents, not known supporters. Interesting.” Sarah Atherton, the MP for Wrexham, won by the Tories from Labour in 2019, said: “I’ve lodged my concerns due to an instant backlash from members.” Peter Gibson, the Tory MP for Darlington, wrote: “Inbox very positive for Lee.” On a separate Tory WhatsApp group, Mr Gibson wrote that the Tories “are a broad church and Lee has been a huge asset to our party”.      11.19am GMT   Some 290 people were detected crossing the English Channel on Sunday, the highest number on a single day for more than a month, PA Media reports. PA says:  According to the Home Office, the cumulative number of arrivals by small boats in 2024 now stands at a provisional total of 2,006. This is 32% lower than the total at this point last year, which was 2,953, but 49% higher than the total at this stage in 2022, which was 1,482. The 290 arrivals on Sunday represents the highest daily number since 358 arrivals on 17 January. Five boats were detected on Sunday, which suggests an average of around 58 people per boat. There were 29,437 arrivals across the whole of 2023, down 36% on a record 45,774 arrivals in 2022.      11.14am GMT   Today’s announcement from No 10 about how £4.7bn will be spent on transport projects in the north of England and the Midlands using some of the money saved from the cancellation of phase two of HS2 has been criticised as little more than a re-announcement of money already pledged. In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Henri Murison, chief executive of business group the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said:  I’m still kind of happy to receive this money in place of nothing, but it is also coming alongside the fact that many of these same communities will not benefit from HS2 and we still haven’t got enough clarity on Northern Powerhouse Rail, which is still a very important and fundamental part of the north transport system. We haven’t got the clarity out of the route that was supposed to be announced imminently and instead the government, rather than going to the north-west, which I would have liked them to do and announced that they are definitely going to do Northern Powerhouse Rail, that it’s going to go from Manchester to Manchester airport, through towards Liverpool, instead they come and re-announce something here in Yorkshire. I don’t fundamentally understand why on earth the cabinet is coming to simply announce something that they already told us about.      10.14am GMT  Badenoch claims definition of Islamophobia favoured by Labour is flawed  Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair and shadow secretary for state for women and equalities, told the Today progamme this morning that the government should adopt the definition of Islamophobia used by Labour and other major parties. This is the definition produced by the all-party parliamentar group on British Muslims, which describes Islamophobia as “rooted in racism and .. a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness”. But in posts on X last night Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary and minister for women and equalities, said “anti-Muslim hatred” was a better term. She explained:  We use the term “Anti-Muslim hatred”. It makes clear the law protects Muslims. In this country, we have a proud tradition of religious freedom AND the freedom to criticise religion.The definition of “Islamophobia” she uses creates a blasphemy law via the back door if adopted. https://t.co/lhHdSbs6Kz— Kemi Badenoch (@KemiBadenoch) February 25, 2024   We use the term “Anti-Muslim hatred”.

In this country, we have a proud tradition of religious freedom AND the freedom to criticise religion.The definition of “Islamophobia” she [Dodds] uses creates a blasphemy law via the back door if adopted   As the minister for the Equality Act, I also know the definition of Islamophobia that @AnnelieseDodds and Labour have adopted is not in line with law as written. Anti-Muslim hatred is more precise and better reflects the UK’s laws, as others have noted: https://civitas.org.uk/content/files/islamophobiaopenletter.pdf  UPDATE: This is what Dodds posted on X last night in response.  Strange that numerous parties in the UK - including the Scottish Conservatives - have adopted this definition then.🤔 The first step towards dealing with a problem is accepting that it exists. https://t.co/mUhz0HfgGZ— Anneliese Dodds (@AnnelieseDodds) February 25, 2024   Strange that numerous parties in the UK - including the Scottish Conservatives - have adopted this definition then.🤔The first step towards dealing with a problem is accepting that it exists.   Updated at 10.27am GMT    10.03am GMT  Lee Anderson could have Tory whip restored if he apologises, transport secretary Mark Harper suggests  Mark Harper, the transport secretary, has suggested that Lee Anderson could have the Conservative party whip restored if he apologises for what he said about Sadiq Khan. In an interview on Sky News this morning, asked what Anderson would have to do to be readmitted to the party, Harper replied:  I hope he will reflect on what he said and he will retract those comments and apologise … But I’m not going to tell the chief whip how to do his job, that’s for him … [Anderson has] contributed a lot in the past. I’d like to see him be able to contribute to the Conservative party in the future.  Harper said Anderson’s comments were wrong but, despite being asked repeatedly, he refused to say if he considered them racist.     9.58am GMT       9.55am GMT   Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, says Rishi Sunak should have condemned Lee Anderson’s comments as racist and Islamophobic in his interviews this morning. In a statement she says:  The refusal of Rishi Sunak and his ministers to properly call out Lee Anderson’s extreme comments shows just how low the Conservative party has fallen. Rishi Sunak needs to condemn Anderson’s comments for what they are, Islamophobic and racist, and make clear he won’t be let back into the Conservative party.      9.33am GMT   While the Lee Anderson row has been dominating the national news this morning, arguably the most interesting exchange in Rishi Sunak’s morning interview round came this morning when he was asked about the state of the NHS by Georgey Spanswick on Radio York. I have beefed up the earlier post at 8.16am with the full quote from the PM (although you might need to refresh the page to get the update to appear.) But the most memorable comment did not come from Sunak, but from the presenter. She said she had a friend who keeled over at the doctors’ surgery last week, but was told by the GP they would not send her to A&E because they would have to wait for nine hours. This does not count as news, because news is normally thought of was what we don’t know, or what comes as a surprise, and almost everyone now can tell a story about themselves or someone they know having to wait hours and hours at A&E. But the fact that something is no longer news does not stop it mattering, and at the election health will be a more important issue than Lee Anderson. In a campaign that will involve constant contact with the public and the media, Sunak may be hearing stories like Spanswick’s all the time. He will need a better answer than the one he gave this morning.     9.18am GMT   The Rishi Sunak interviews are over. They have not taken us forward very much, but Henry Zeffman from the BBC thinks Sunak hardened the Conservative party’s line on Lee Anderson marginally, compared with what Oliver Dowden was saying yesterday.  PM is hardening the Conservatives' line a little on Lee Anderson this morning. Before, the position was he was suspended because he didn't apologise. Today Sunak said the comments were unacceptable and wrong \"and that's why he had the whip suspended\". No mention of an apology— Henry Zeffman (@hzeffman) February 26, 2024   PM is hardening the Conservatives’ line a little on Lee Anderson this morning. Before, the position was he was suspended because he didn’t apologise.Today Sunak said the comments were unacceptable and wrong “and that’s why he had the whip suspended”. No mention of an apology  But saying Anderson should apologise was an implicit acceptance that the original remark was unacceptable, and so broadly the Dowden and Sunak talking points have been the same. It is understandable why radio presenters with only a very short interview slot, and under pressure to ask Sunak about local issues which never get addressed by the national media, did not interrogate Sunak at more length on this issue. As Jon Sopel from the News Agents podcast points out, if they had, they might have pressed him to explain properly what it was about what Anderson said that was unacceptable.  Just listened to the PM and Mark Harper - both saying Lee Anderson’s comments were ‘wrong’ and whip withdrawn for not apologising. They refuse to say that he was racist or Islamophobic. So my question is this:What exactly do they want Lee Anderson to apologise for? Bewildering— Jon Sopel (@jonsopel) February 26, 2024   Just listened to the PM and Mark Harper - both saying Lee Anderson’s comments were ‘wrong’ and whip withdrawn for not apologising.They refuse to say that he was racist or Islamophobic. So my question is this:What exactly do they want Lee Anderson to apologise for?Bewildering  The Tories have said that Anderson was suspended because he would not apologise to Sadiq Khan for saying that he was under the control of Islamists. (See 8.01am.) But the party has not said whether or not it believes that this remark was Islamaphobic, and it has not said whether or not it thinks it is acceptable for people to make wider claims about “Islamists” having undue influence. In his comment Anderson was actually distancing himself from an even more provocative and extreme comment made by Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who wrote an article in the Daily Telegraph last week claiming:  The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now. They have bullied the Labour Party, they have bullied our institutions, and now they have bullied our country into submission.  Anderson was saying he thought Braverman was wrong because, in his view, the Islamist take-over has only extended to the capital, not to the UK as a whole. As my colleague Peter Walker points out, Sunak’s reluctance to talk directly and specifically about Islamaophobia has echoes of Jeremy Corbyn’s reluctance to talk directly and specifically about antisemitism.  Asked on BBC Humberside if he is refusing to engage with Islamophobia, Rishi Sunak says “prejudice of any kind is unacceptable” - a presumably unconscious if nonetheless direct echo of Jeremy Corbyn's much-used form of words over antisemitism.— Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) February 26, 2024   Asked on BBC Humberside if he is refusing to engage with Islamophobia, Rishi Sunak says “prejudice of any kind is unacceptable” - a presumably unconscious if nonetheless direct echo of Jeremy Corbyn’s much-used form of words over antisemitism.   It is increasingly notable that Sunak and his ministers seem almost pathologically unable to mention the idea of anti-Islam prejudice (beyond, in a few cases, arguing that ‘Islamophobia’ is a term that shouldn’t be used).      8.44am GMT   At the start of the Radio Lincolnshire interview, Scott Dalton put it to Rishi Sunak that the transport money for the county being announced today just replaced money that had been previously taken away. He said the county council says it needs £400m just to bring roads in Lincolnshire up to the national standard. Today’s announcement promises just half of that sum, spread over seven years, he said. He said that was only £37m a year. In response, Sunak said overall funding for the council was going up by 8%.  Updated at 9.35am GMT    8.39am GMT   Rishi Sunak is now on BBC Radio Lincolnshire. Scott Dalton is interviewing him, and asks why it is taking so long for the HS2 money to go to transport projects in the north. Sunak says he thinks the money has been redirected quite quickly. Q: In Lincolnshire the redevelopment project for RAF Scampton has been put in jeopardy by the plans for a camp for asylum seekers there. Sunak says the plan for a camp for asylum seekers is only temporary. Q: It is for three years. Will the developers wait three years to invest the £300m in the site? Sunak says he needs to act to stop the boats. The plan is working, he says. Q: You say are listening to people’s frustrations on RAF Scampton. But you have ignored the local MP, Sir Edward Leigh, the council and the residents. It is a heritage site. Sunak says the heritage aspects are being respected. He says he wishes he did not have to house illegal migrants. He says his returns agreement with Albania has largely stopped arrivals from that country. He says he thinks the Rwanda policy can have the same impact on. a bigger scale.     8.32am GMT  Sunak claims UK is 'most successful multi-ethnic democracy in world' and says racism and prejudice 'completely unacceptable'  Q: Is there a hierachy of hate? You condemn antisemitism, but you have been accused of overlooking Islamophobia in your own party? Sunak says he does not accept that characterisation. He goes on:  I believe racism or prejudice of any kind is completely unacceptable, and we must stamp it out.  Asked to give a commitment that he will not tolerate hate of any kind, Sunak repeats this phrase. He says he is proud of the fact that, when he became the first British Asian prime minister, that was not a big deal. He goes on:  And that’s because we’re the most successful multi-ethnic democracy in the world. And that’s because we have a way of doing these things, of respecting everyone, and at the same time ensuring that everyone integrates into our community and subscribes to a common set of British values. That’s not an easy thing to do. But I think we do it better than any other country, and we need to work hard to protect that.  Sunak ends by saying for a third time that racism of any kind is completely unacceptable.     8.27am GMT   Kofi Smiles is interviewing Rishi Sunak on Radio Humberside. They have covered the transport announcement, and Sunak is now talking about support for the steel industry.      8.26am GMT  What Sunak said about Lee Anderson  Rishi Sunak was asked four questions about Lee Anderson on Radio York. Here are the questions and answers. As you can see, all four answers were essentially the same (a standard Sunak technique). Q: Has the Conservative Party got Islamophobic tendencies?  No, of course it doesn’t. And I think it’s incumbent on all of us, especially those elected to parliament, not to inflame our debates in a way that’s harmful to others. Lee’s comments weren’t acceptable. They were wrong, and that’s why he’s had the whip suspended.  Q: How do you account for Lee Anderson’s comments and your decision to suspend him?  His choice of words wasn’t acceptable, it was wrong. That’s why the whip was suspended. And words matter, especially in the current environment where tensions are running high, and I think it’s incumbent on all of us to choose them carefully.  Q: How frustrating is it that he hasn’t apologised for those comments?  The most important thing is that people realise that the words they use in a situation that we’re in now, where tensions are running higher than I think any of us would like, and my priority is to try and take the heat out of this situation and that’s what everyone wants to see. And that’s why words matter. And his words weren’t acceptable. They were wrong, and that’s why the whip was suspended.  Q: How much of a blow is this to your election chances in red wall seats?  It’s not about that. I think in a situation like this, it’s important that we maintain high standards. That’s why the whip was suspended.   Updated at 8.51am GMT    8.19am GMT   Sunak is now due on BBC Radio Humberside. You can listen here.     8.16am GMT  Sunak claims NHS improving, but accepts it's 'not where we want to be'  Spanswick now turns to the NHS. She says she was involved in an accident last year, when she was due to interview Sunak, and asked the paramedic with her what he would ask Sunak if he had the chance. She said he wanted to know “why are you running down the NHS”. Sunak claims performance in A&E departments is getting better. He says the strikes have made it harder to tackle waiting lists. Spanswick says a friend was at the doctor’s last week, and was told the doctor would not send them to A&E because they would have to wait nine hours. Sunak says of course that is not right. But the use of community diagnostic hubs will make thing better, he says. UPDATE: Sunak said:  I come from an NHS family, of course I don’t want to run it down. We’re putting a record amount of investment in, more funding, so that’s never been higher – more doctors, more nurses, and we’re making improvements. Now, look, that’s not going to happen overnight. But if you look at the performance of ambulances and emergency departments this winter, it’s better than it was last winter. So that is progress. And when it comes to the waiting lists, in the last few months actually we’ve seen the waiting lists start to fall. And that’s because we haven’t had as much industrial action. Obviously there is once again industrial action, but at the end of last year we had no industrial action in October or November and the waiting list fell by about 150,000.” Are we where we want to be? Not yet. Are we making progress? Yes, the plan is working. If we stick with it, I know that things will get better.   Updated at 8.48am GMT    8.13am GMT   Sunak’s line on Lee Anderson was broadly the same as Oliver Dowden’s yesterday. He did not get pressed on some of outstanding questions relating to this as yet unanswered, and is now being asked about the transport announcement for the north of England – the main reason for the interview.     8.10am GMT  Sunak says Lee Anderson's comments were 'not acceptable', but denies claim Tory party has Islamophobic tendencies  Georgey Spanswick is interviewing Rishi Sunak on Radio York. She says Sunak is on the programme to talk about transport. But she is going to start with the Lee Anderson row, she says. Q: Has the Conservative party got Islamophobic tendencies?  “No, of course it hasn’t”, Sunak says. He says people should not be inflaming tensions in this situation. Words matter. Anderson did not apologise. His words were not acceptable, and he was suspended. He says it is important to maintain high standards. Anderson’s words were “not acceptable”, and wrong, he says. He says he is sure the interviewer will now want to ask transport, and the “compelling offer” that the Conservative party has.     8.02am GMT   Rishi Sunak is about to be interviewed on BBC Radio York. You can listen here.     8.01am GMT  Rishi Sunak expected to face questions on Lee Anderson Islamophobia row in radio interviews  Good morning. Rishi Sunak is set to break his silence on the Lee Anderson Islamophobia row shortly. Anderson, a former deputy chair of the Conservative party, told GB News on Friday:  I don’t actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they’ve got control of [Sadiq] Khan, and they’ve got control of London.  After initially defending him, the Conservative party suspended him about 24 hours, on the grounds that he had refused to apologise to the offence given to Khan, the Labour mayor of London, who is a Muslim. But in interviews yesterday Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, refused to rule out Anderson being allow to rejoin the parliamentary Conservative party, and declined to describe what Anderson said as clearly Islamophobic. We’ll hear from Sunak himself shortly. He is about to give interviews to local radio stations in Yorkshire, where he is chairing a cabinet meeting this morning. Here is Eleni Courea’s overnight story about the row.   Related: Rishi Sunak urged to speak out by Tory peer as Islamophobia row deepens   All parties have to discipline MPs who say offensive things from time to time, but Anderson is not just a random backbencher. When Sunak made the surprise decision to make him Conservative party chair a year ago, it was not despite the fact that he was best know for saying provocative things likely to appeal to elderly, white, male reactionaries. It was precisely because of his popularity with this group, which is also what secured Anderson his presenting job with GB News. Here is the agenda for the day. After 8am: Rishi Sunak gives interviews to three BBC local radio stations Morning: Sunak chairs a cabinet meeting in Yorkshire. Morning: Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner visit the West Midlands, where they will be promoting Labour’s plans for housebuilding. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: James Cleverly, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

        "content": "In his Nottinghamshire constituency, Lee Anderson has long been considered a Marmite character, attracting staunch supporters and vehement critics alike, and the reaction to his latest comments proved no different. Some said they felt Anderson had been punished unfairly for his statements about the London mayor on Friday, which have been labelled Islamophobic and led to him losing the Conservative whip. Others said they were horrified by his words and believed his suspension from the Tory party had been a long time coming. “It was bang out of order. He’s an embarrassment,” said James Bond, 40, who was out buying supplies for his latest job, building a play area for a nearby SEN children’s centre. “We need proper grown-up politics and I think his days in power are numbered around here. I certainly won’t be voting for him and this has been a long time coming in my opinion.” On Friday, Anderson sparked outrage when he claimed on GB News that “Islamists” had “got control of London” and its mayor, Sadiq Khan. He has refused to apologise, saying his comments were “right” but that the wording “may have been clumsy”. In a statement, he said: “It is not my intention to upset anyone, I believe in free speech and have 100% respect for people of all backgrounds.”   Related: Lee Anderson: from Labour councillor to Labour wind-up merchant   His refusal to apologise led to the whip being withdrawn. Rishi Sunak said his words were “wrong” but he did not call them Islamophobic and the party has not ruled out Anderson being allowed to return. Extra police patrols have been brought in around Anderson’s constituency office in Sutton-in-Ashfield, in the heart of his former “red wall” seat. But on the streets of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, a former coalmining town in the constituency, there were still many people who backed their MP and felt his comments will have resonated with many. “We’re not allowed to say anything, are we? He made a comment, whether it was right or wrong, I don’t know. He just said his opinion but it hasn’t fallen on the right ears and it’s upset people,” said Michael Swain, 72, who formerly worked in engineering. He thinks support for Anderson runs at about 50/50 in the constituency and he does not believe his words will have done much damage. “I think the people who have supported him in the past will still support him now,” he said. A woman passing by, who chose not to give her name, voiced strong support for Anderson. “I agree with everything he said. At least he’s telling the truth that a lot of people daren’t open their mouth and say. But they’re calling him racist. I think it’s wrong what they have done to him,” she said. But there were also signs the tide was beginning to turn against Anderson, with some people saying that while they had previously voted for him, they would not do so again. Caroline Cutts, 56, said it was partly Anderson’s outspoken opinions, particularly his frequent appearances on GB News that she said was “stirring the pot”, along with her dissatisfaction with the Conservative party more generally that had changed her vote. “He’s very controversial, isn’t he? I won’t be voting Conservative next time,” she said, adding that although she wasn’t sure Anderson had meant to be racist, his comments were too “close to the mark”. “I used to like him but I’ve gone off him a bit in recent times. I thought he was doing quite a bit of good but now I’m not so sure,” she said. Bond said: “I think he was only voted in off the back of Brexit. His dog-whistling politics appeals to a certain majority around here, but even here I think his days are numbered because people are just sick of the Tories. I think we’ll see him with the Reform party next.” The constituency, which is 95% white according to the 2021 census, has high levels of deprivation in some areas and 70% of people voted in favour of Brexit in 2016. Julie, 57, who asked not to give her surname, said she went to the same school as Anderson for a number of years during their childhood and she was no great fan of his. “I think he deserves [the suspension] for what he said, to be honest. I think if you’re in power, you’ve got to behave in a certain way,” she said. “I don’t think he represents what everyone else feels.” She said she still felt Anderson lacked credibility after he previously switched from the Labour party to the Conservatives. “I just feel like he’s sold out because he’s gone from one side to the other,” she said. “It makes you lose faith in what he stands for.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2024 to delete a photograph of Sutton-in-Ashfield that had been incorrectly captioned as Kirkby-in-Ashfield.

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt gave advice at a Conservative fundraiser to a senior Fujitsu executive who lobbied him in relation to government spending on AI and supercomputers, according to released emails. Keith Dear – a former Downing street adviser who leads the firm’s work on quantum, supercomputers and next-generation AI – wrote to Hunt a day after a Conservative party fundraiser at the end of September. Fujitsu’s lucrative government contracts subsequently came under scrutiny amid a renewed focus on its role in the Horizon scandal. Correspondence released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show that Dear emailed Hunt a day after the fundraiser in Chingford. He copied in Clark Vasey, who has been Fujitsu UK’s head of corporate affairs since 2014 and a director of the rightwing Blue Collar Conservatives group. Dear reminded Hunt in the email that he had asked about the chancellor’s plans to ringfence “digital transformation” funds for departments in the next spending review – and who would be the right civil servant to approach about it. “You suggested that we contact [the then Treasury minister] John Glen, and asked that I email the request to you, to give you a chance to consider which of the Treasury’s civil servants would be the most appropriate point of contact,” added Dear. He recalled that the men had previously discussed Fujitsu’s work on quantum, supercomputing and next-generation AI. Dear said he was “keen” to help departments bid realistically and with the right degree of ambition. The disclosure is the latest insight into the influence and access to government officials enjoyed by Fujitsu, the firm behind the faulty Horizon IT system. It has said it will pause bids for government contracts while an inquiry looks into how the software provided evidence to the Post Office that helped wrongfully convict more than 700 post office operators. The Labour MP and shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, said: “The VIP lane for PPE may be closed, but the same old informal route for Tory cronies appears to be fully open for business. “If the Treasury claim the ministerial code was followed in this case, they should publish the accounts that the chancellor gave to his department of the two conversations he held with Mr Dear on government business at successive Tory fundraising events. And, if those records do not exist, Mr Hunt needs to explain why.” The Guardian reported earlier this month that the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, failed to raise the issue of the Horizon scandal or compensation for post office operators when she met Fujitsu at Davos last year, instead focusing on asking the firm for its views on investing in the UK. A Fujitsu spokesperson said: “Dr Keith Dear attended as a guest. “Tickets were purchased personally by attendees. Fujitsu was not engaged in or supporting the event. No donation was made at the event or subsequently,” said a spokesperson. “Dr Dear spoke very briefly with the chancellor on the government’s technology priorities. As a leading expert in emerging technologies, Dr Dear speaks regularly to the UK government and other international governments and bodies on issues relating to next-generation AI, quantum and high performance computing.” A government spokesperson said: “All requirements under the ministerial code were complied with, and it is normal practice for ministers and officials to engage on a regular basis with a range of stakeholders to discuss government policy. “Government contracts are decided through fair and open competition. We welcome Fujitsu’s decision to pause bidding for work with new government customers until such time as the statutory inquiry into the Horizon scandal concludes.”"

It’s double standards for political benefit.”\n\n Related: Lee Anderson: from Labour councillor to Labour wind-up merchant \n\nGavin Barwell, a peer and former chief of staff to Theresa May, said Anderson should not be allowed back in to the parliamentary party until he made a genuine apology. \n“In terms of what happens next. I think if you were going to let anyone back in, you’d want to be convinced that an apology was genuine,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear that the language that was used, was used with the intent of stirring up religious hatred and division.”\nDowning Street said the government did not tolerate “anti-Muslim hatred in any form”, after Sunak’s spokesperson was challenged over his refusal to refer specifically to Islamophobia while condemning prejudice more generally.\nKhan and his Conservative challenger in the London mayoral elections, Susan Hall, presented a united front on Monday when they both called for zero tolerance of racism in the contest.\n“We are facing some very difficult times, with the politics of extremism, division and blame becoming more mainstream,” Khan wrote in an article published by the Standard.\nAlso writing in the Standard, Hall said: “I may be one of Sadiq Khan’s biggest critics, but I also see the monstrous abuse he gets as one of the country’s most prominent Muslim politicians,.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has denied that the Conservative party has a problem with Islamophobia after Lee Anderson’s comments about Sadiq Khan, continuing to label them as “wrong” rather than prejudiced. During a round of BBC local radio interviews to promote spending moved from HS2 to local transport projects, the prime minister was quizzed on Anderson’s claim that the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamists, remarks for which he lost the Conservative whip. Asked on Radio York if his party had Islamophobic tendencies, he replied: “No, of course it doesn’t. And I think it’s incumbent on all of us, especially those elected to parliament, not to inflame our debates in a way that’s harmful to others.” Speaking to Radio Humberside, Sunak rejected the idea that the Conservatives used a de facto hierarchy of racism in which antisemitism was condemned but Islamophobia was allowed to run unchecked. “I believe racism or prejudice of any kind is completely unacceptable, and we must stamp it out,” Sunak said, not mentioning the specific idea of anti-Muslim prejudice.   Related: Muslim group calls for Tory inquiry into party’s ‘structural Islamophobia’   In comments that run notably contrary to those of Anderson, the former Tory party vice-chair, and Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who argued last week that Islamists were now “in charge”, Sunak said the UK was the “most successful multi-ethnic democracy in the world”. He went on: “That’s because we have a way of doing these things, of respecting everyone, and at the same time ensuring that everyone integrates into our community and subscribes to a common set of British values. “And that’s why, as I said, racism or prejudice of any kind is completely unacceptable.” Sunak’s refusal to engage with the specific idea of anti-Muslim prejudice – which follows the refusal of Mark Harper, the transport secretary, in his own round of media interviews on Monday morning, to say whether Anderson had been racist – is likely to increase concern among some Tories. Sayeeda Warsi, the Conservative peer who was a cabinet minister in David Cameron’s government, told the Guardian on Sunday that Sunak needed to “find the language” to “call Islamophobia Islamophobia”. “What is it about the prime minister that he can’t even call out anti-Muslim racism and anti-Muslim bigotry? Why can’t he just use those words?” she said. Asked by Sky News whether Anderson’s description of Khan, including the claim he had “given our capital city away to his mates”, was motivated by prejudice against the mayor, who is Muslim, Harper refused to say. “Well, it was wrong,” he said. “And I’m not going to get into arguing about the rights and wrongs. What he said was wrong, and in my book, wrong is a strong word.” Harper indicated it was possible Anderson, who lost the Conservative whip on Saturday after his comments the previous evening on GB News, could return to the Tory fold if he apologised. “That’s not a matter for me, that’s a matter for the chief whip,” Harper said. “I’ve been chief whip in the past. I’m not going to tell the chief whip how to do his job.” He added: “[Anderson] said things about Sadiq Khan that weren’t true and that were quite wrong to say. He was given the opportunity to retract those comments and to apologise for them. He didn’t do so, so very clear, decisive leadership was taken and the whip has been removed really from him.” Asked what message it would send to British Muslims if Anderson was given back the whip, Harper added: “I think … the firm and decisive leadership that took the whip away from him very quickly, when he refused to retract and apologise, sends a very strong message that we don’t tolerate people saying such things in the Conservative party.”"

        "published_date": "2024-02-26T06:00:18+00:00",
        "content": "The head of Britain’s trade union movement and the boss of a leading retailer have joined forces to demand the government takes tougher action to catch wealthy tax dodgers. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and Julian Richer, founder of the Richer Sounds hi-fi chain, said the public were losing out on up to £36bn a year in taxes owed by companies and individuals that were not being collected. In a joint intervention before next week’s budget – when the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to prioritise pre-election tax giveaways – they warned HM Revenue and Customs lacked the necessary funding to chase down businesses and the super-rich for non-payment, avoidance and evasion. They called on Hunt to boost HMRC’s funding so it can drastically increase the number of investigations and enforcement cases it can handle in order to close the tax gap, warning as much as £20bn was being lost to “serious transgressions”. “It’s a national scandal,” Richer told the Guardian, in a joint interview with Nowak at the TUC’s Congress House headquarters in central London. “What really annoys us are these guys ripping off the state. So for me it’s personal. I’m absolutely outraged by what’s going on. “We chase people on benefits who don’t pay – we found money for that. And yet, we’re not spending it on this? It’s absolutely wrong and the great majority of the public are being cheated by this lack of effort.” Throwing the weight of the union movement behind calls to boost HMRC’s resources to chase businesses and wealthy individuals for unpaid taxes, Nowak said: “This is a no-brainer. From a fairness point of view, to support our public services, and to make sure people pay their fair share. “Our members pay their taxes. For them, taxes aren’t optional. HMRC doesn’t show discretion. But here we’ve got tens of billions of pounds that should be going to fund our schools and hospitals that are being wasted.”   Related: Jeremy Hunt’s budget giveaway ‘will act as sweet filling in tax sandwich’    The union leader and multimillionaire business owner pointed to figures estimating that HMRC’s tax gap – the difference between what it expects to receive and its actual receipts – increased to £36bn last year. While some of that number relates to common mistakes or carelessness, analysis by the TaxWatch thinktank, which is bankrolled by Richer, shows £20bn comes from more serious transgressions such as criminal attacks, evasion, legal interpretations arguing for non-payment, hiding of economic activity and avoidance. The independent watchdog, which Richer helped to launch after growing angry with Britain’s “broken” tax system, said compliance checks by HMRC were down 20% from pre-pandemic levels amid a lack of funding to carry out checks and depleted morale among staff. It follows a report earlier this month based on data from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that found the number of investigations by an HMRC fraud unit into offshore, corporate and wealthy taxpayers had fallen by more than half in five years. Nowak said that funding for HMRC had in effect flatlined despite a surge in its caseload to investigate Covid fraud, leading to burnout and inefficiency because staff were overworked and underpaid. “Dealing with some of the abuses around what’s been happening with the Covid recovery funds meant they took their eyes off what was happening with tax more broadly,” he said. “You’ve got a government that currently isn’t really interested in enforcing its own rules, particularly for those who might be donating to its own election campaign.” The TUC and TaxWatch said there was a strong case for funding HMRC because estimates showed that every £1 spent on compliance generated £15 back for the public purse, with the returns rising to as much as £39 for investigations into large companies. Nowak said the lack of funding was emblematic of a wider shortsighted approach under the Conservatives to the public sector, arguing that a lack of money for schools, the health service, police and other services was undermining the economy. Amid speculation that the chancellor could prioritise tax cuts over funding for public services, Richer warned that business leaders would prefer a country with a functioning state. “We’ve got so many things broken in our country, we need to spend more money,” he said. “The NHS is crumbling, dental services are crumbling, the roads are not being repaired, the criminal justice system is falling apart at the seams. Is this a time to cut taxes, really? “It’s just a bribe from a political party trying to get votes.” HMRC was approached for comment."

        "content": "Britain’s stretched public services will buckle under the weight of the spending cuts being planned for after the election, economists have warned, as Jeremy Hunt prepares for another round of tax reductions in next week’s budget. Experts say the level of public sector spending pencilled in for the next parliament would mean cuts equivalent to those undertaken by David Cameron’s government from 2010 to 2015. Some have warned the next government will not be able to implement them, and will be forced either to raise taxes or borrow more to fund emergency spending. The stark warnings come as the chancellor considers cutting billions more from his public spending plans to pay for further reductions in either income tax or national insurance at next week’s budget. Last week the Resolution Foundation calculated such a move would mean taking a fifth out of budgets for certain departments across the parliament, sparking concern among economists, trade unions and even some Conservatives. James Smith, research director at the thinktank, said: “We are essentially returning to austerity levels of cuts in terms of the implied spending cuts.” Referring to the possibility of reducing spending plans even further to pay for steeper tax cuts at the budget, Smith added: “We are talking about going from one set of undeliverable spending plans to something that is worse. How could we take 20% out of the justice budget, for example? It is extremely difficult.” Stuart Hoddinott, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government, said: “The current state of public services are generally pretty poor across the board. If any government was to try and implement these spending plans, they would lead to a deterioration in performance that would be unacceptable to any government.” Hunt announced a 2p cut to national insurance at the autumn statement last year, with public spending forecast to rise 1% above inflation each year over the next parliament as a result. However, much of that money will be taken up by just a few departments where spending is protected. They include health, where both the government and the Labour party have signed up to a plan to recruit more staff, which would mean budget increases of 3.6% a year. Defence is also protected, given Britain’s commitment to meet the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, as is international aid, which has to remain at at least 0.5% of gross national income. As a result, unprotected departments are likely to face swingeing cuts across the next five years unless the next government raises taxes or borrows more. The departments likely to face heavy spending reductions include justice, local government and the Home Office.   Related: Jeremy Hunt’s budget giveaway ‘will act as sweet filling in tax sandwich’    The Labour party is planning to relieve some of the spending pressure with particular tax rises, such as ending the non-dom regime, which will raise money to pay for more weekend and evening GP appointments, among other things. Apart from those one-off schemes, however, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has ruled out raising income or wealth taxes to fund daily departmental spending. Unlike in 1997 or 2010, however, the next government will take office with public services already at breaking point. In the justice system, for example, the crown court case backlog for England and Wales stood at 64,709 by last June – more than 50% higher than three years previously. In 2022 it took an average of 379 days to process an offence from it being committed to the end of a trial, up from 251 days in 2019. In local government, eight English councils have in effect declared themselves bankrupt since 2018 and a fifth of local authorities believe they are likely to go bust over the next year. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at Oxford Economics, said: “The problem is that this comes on the back of large real-terms cuts for those departments from 2010 to 2015 and quite restrained spending since then. Efficiency savings have long since been exhausted – you’re now really talking about choosing which services not to provide any more.” Public sector unions have begun to sound the alarm about the cuts to come. Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison, said: “Public services are in the last chance saloon. Years of underfunding mean they’re already close to collapse and slashing spending further still is the last thing anyone needs.” But some Conservatives are also concerned about whether the plans are possible to deliver. Lord Deben, the former Tory chair, told the Observer last weekend: “The priority for most people at the moment is to improve public services to make sure that those who are least well off are looked after and to make it more attractive to work.” In a letter on Monday, the party’s One Nation caucus urged the chancellor to prioritise measures to help young parents, workers and students, including a multi-year settlement for childcare. The group, which has 107 Tory MPs registered with it, recommended eight policies including capping interest rates on student loans to the average rate commercially available, introducing a levy on foreign owners of vacant luxury flats, and abolishing stamp duty for house buyers who are downsizing. The group also said the chancellor should cut direct taxes for working people and introduce reforms to tax all income at the same rate, whether it comes from earnings, dividends or benefits. Damian Green, chair of the caucus, said: “This is our chance to demonstrate to voters that we are on their side and that we are taking steps to alleviate pressures they face in all aspects of everyday lives.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2024. An earlier version said that Christina McAnea was the general secretary of Unite; this should have said Unison."

        "content": "With the Conservative party lagging 20 points behind in the polls, enduring crushing byelection defeats and weekly controversies, it’s a difficult time to be a government minister. One figure who appears to glide effortlessly above the mire though is David Cameron, who was unexpectedly brought back to the political frontline in November as foreign secretary. He marked 100 days in office last week and has by all accounts loved every minute of it. The Foreign Office appears to love him back. Despite his considerable political baggage, the prevailing view in the department is that having Cameron at the helm has been a shot in the arm for UK diplomacy, insiders said. Officials are seemingly impressed with his energy and work ethic. Diplomats say he is a natural mediator who knows how to interact with foreign dignitaries and inject humour at the right moments.  Cameron, a member of the House of Lords rather than an MP, has no constituency to worry about, nor does he have to hurry back from abroad for tricky Commons votes. Plus, being a former prime minister lends him stature and opens doors, his supporters say. “He’s getting a lot done,” one European diplomat in London concluded. Unusually, Cameron seems to have been given licence to set British foreign policy while the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, focuses on domestic issues ahead of the general election. One civil servant who has worked with Cameron said he was like the “foreign affairs PM”. Nowhere has this been more apparent than over the conflict in the Middle East. Cameron made headlines last month by declaring that the UK was prepared to recognise a Palestinian state before a two-state solution had been negotiated with Israel. Downing Street has repeatedly denied any suggestion of a split with Sunak on the issue. “Frankly, I don’t think Rishi Sunak is very interested in foreign affairs and I think he’s happy to leave that to Cameron,” said Peter Ricketts, who served as national security adviser and ambassador to Paris during his premiership. “Cameron always found foreign affairs fascinating as prime minister, and now he can do it full time. With the authority that comes with … he can speak out and he can push the envelope on British policy, as he did over the issue of recognising a Palestinian state.” Some believe Cameron is acting as an outrider for the US on the issue, helping to put pressure on Israel to start discussing a viable long-term solution. “If you’re going to have a two-state solution, you’ve got to recognise a Palestinian state at some point,” Ricketts said. “I suspect it’s quite helpful to [the US secretary of state] Antony Blinken and he probably doesn’t feel he can go that far himself, but he’s quite happy that Cameron should be staking that position out.” Gaza aside, Cameron’s main focus has been Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He travelled to Washington DC in December and wrote an opinion piece in February with a punchy message about the need to continue funding Ukraine’s defence. Some, however, thought that for its intended audience of rightwing Republican legislators, some of them supportive of Donald Trump, the message was off the mark. “Many Republican sceptics support the Ukraine cause but see China as the ultimate threat, and worry the US can’t fund both Ukraine and Taiwan,” a source who has had discussions with the Republican right this month said. “Cameron came over with a heavy-handed lecture telling these people that they are a bunch of appeasers when he himself has a load of baggage around China. That was always going to go down badly.” China is an area where Cameron has had to tread carefully. The landscape has changed dramatically since he was prime minister. He heralded a “golden era” of relations in 2015, welcomed Xi Jinping on a state visit and, after leaving office, he tried to set up a £1bn UK-China investment fund. As recently as September, Cameron flew to the UAE to drum up investment for the controversial Chinese-built Port City Colombo in Sri Lanka. Cameron tackled the issue in his first interview as foreign secretary by stressing the government line. “China has become much more aggressive,” he told the BBC. “And so that’s why security and protection is such an important part of our policy. Engaging China is one part of the approach we need to take … We’re not going to solve challenges like climate change, unless we engage.” Senior officials say he has handled the issue delicately so far. “The worry was that he was going to go totally the other way to prove how anti-China he was. He didn’t do that,” one said. “He’s performing a careful balancing act between pressure from China-sceptic politicians and what the UK’s international partners are doing,” said Sam Hogg, a foreign policy analyst who writes the Beijing to Britain intelligence briefing. “The US, many EU countries and Australia have sent senior representatives to China, including heads of government. The UK is lagging behind in this respect.” Coming up on Cameron’s agenda is a trip to the Indo-Pacific next month, though China is not currently on his itinerary. He had been in talks about making a trip to India in February, which failed to materialise because of scheduling issues. His team said it was now unlikely he would be able to visit India before its general election, which is scheduled to take place in April or May. Cameron’s reception and approach to the Indo-Pacific — a priority region according to the government’s foreign policy strategy — will be the next test. During his first three months he has travelled to Ukraine, Israel, the West Bank, several European capitals, the Falkland Islands, Paraguay, Brazil for G20 meetings and New York for the UN, returning to London over the weekend. “Britain is back,” he triumphantly told a glitzy Foreign Office reception at Lancaster House just before Christmas. In a sign that not everyone thinks the world of Cameron, however, one senior government official present said they had found his address a little jarring. “You may be back,” they remarked. “We’ve been here all along.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2024. David Cameron travelled to Washington DC in December, not February as an earlier version said; and his message about Ukraine defence funding was delivered via an article in February, not during his trip to the US."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been urged to break his silence over a mounting Islamophobia row as senior Conservatives criticised the “dangerous” rhetoric of the party’s former deputy chair. Lee Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, lost the Conservative party whip on Saturday after refusing to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control of” Sadiq Khan. Anderson claimed on GB News that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”.   Related: Muslim group calls for Tory inquiry into party’s ‘structural Islamophobia’   The remarks have led to calls for the prime minister to explicitly denounce anti-Muslim bigotry and act to tackle it internally. Sayeeda Warsi, the Tory peer who was a cabinet minister in David Cameron’s government, said Sunak needed to “find the language” to “call Islamophobia Islamophobia”. “What is it about the prime minister that he can’t even call out anti-Muslim racism and anti-Muslim bigotry? Why can’t he just use those words?” she told the Guardian. Asked whether Sunak should explicitly condemn Anderson’s comments as Islamophobia, Warsi said: “Of course he should. If you can’t call racism racism, if you can’t call antisemitism antisemitism, and if you can’t call Islamophobia Islamophobia, then how are we going to fix it?” In a statement on Sunday, Sunak decried “the explosion in prejudice and antisemitism since the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October” in Israel. He did not explicitly refer to Islamophobia. Khan criticised the prime minister on social media for failing “to mention anti-Muslim hatred at all”. Speaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg show on Sunday, the deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden said he did not agree with Anderson’s comments but added: “I don’t believe that Lee Anderson said those remarks intending to be Islamophobic.” A Conservative party source defended the comments on Friday night, but Anderson was suspended from the party whip on Saturday after refusing to apologise for them. Paul Scully, the former Tory minister for London, said: “We went through all this about Sadiq Khan and his ‘friends’ and all that kind of stuff when Zac Goldsmith was fighting Sadiq [for the mayoralty] the first time. It didn’t work then and it’s not going to work now … It’s just not appropriate.” Ministers also faced questions over why no action had been taken against Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who wrote an article for the Telegraph saying: “The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now.” One Tory MP said: “What I can’t work out is why Suella hasn’t had the whip removed. She said it first.” Another claimed: “Suella’s language has been irresponsible and inflammatory for years. She thinks she needs to reflect what she thinks is public opinion. Actually the British public are far more generous in spirit than she is … She is running in front of herds, polarising opinion and providing the conditions for extremism on all sides to grow. Anderson is an idiot. She [Braverman] is causing harm.” Warsi said: “There will always be people who hide behind the word Zionist, people with a long history of antisemitism who use the term Zionist when they actually mean Jews. It’s a very disingenuous form of antisemitism. And there are always people with a long history of anti-Muslim racism who will hide behind the word Islamist when they actually mean Muslims.” Former justice secretary Robert Buckland, the Tory MP for South Swindon, launched a broadside against Anderson, Braverman and Liz Truss and said that any Conservative politician intent on stoking division “had better get out and join another party”. There was also criticism of the party’s inaction against Truss, the former prime minister, who last week took part in an interview with Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist to Donald Trump. She remained silent as Bannon hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson as a “hero”. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, wrote to Sunak on Sunday urging him to suspend Truss from the party. “If you do not take action you will be allowing the divisive, deluded and dangerous views of the far-right into mainstream British politics,” he said. The Conservative party is divided over Anderson’s future and whether his controversial style of politics helps the party reach socially conservative voters. Some Tory cabinet ministers suggested on Sunday that the door was open for Anderson to return later down the line. Asked about his comments, David TC Davies, the secretary of state for Wales, told BBC Radio Wales: “Lee has made a good contribution to the Conservative party over the years and I hope this issue is going to get sorted out.” He later added that Anderson “has got a good contribution to make and I hope he might return”. Meanwhile Dowden said: “We gave him the opportunity to apologise. Of course, if he apologises, we’d look at the nature of that and make a determination at that point. But that’s a matter for the chief whip.”   Related: Starmer accuses Sunak of harbouring ‘extremists’ in Islamophobia row   Any attempt to readmit Anderson would be resisted by centrist Conservative MPs, who think his incendiary comments repel moderate voters. One senior Tory said: “I think it will be very difficult for the party to readmit Lee given the hard time we have given Labour on racism and discrimination. No 10 did the right thing by acting swiftly and decisively. We have to be clear what we stand for – we either stand up to racism in all its forms or we don’t.” The Muslim Council of Britain, Britain’s largest Muslim body, said the Conservative party should launch an investigation into alleged “structural Islamophobia” within its ranks. In a letter to Tory chairman Richard Holden, MCB secretary general Zara Mohammed said: “Our view is that the Islamophobia in the party is institutional, tolerated by the leadership and seen as acceptable by great swathes of the party membership.” The row comes after Labour faced its own crisis over antisemitism. The party stood by its Rochdale byelection candidate, Azhar Ali, after he was recorded claiming Israel had allowed the 7 October attacks as a pretext to invade Gaza, saying he had immediately apologised. The party withdrew its support when it emerged that Ali also blamed “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” for the suspension of another Labour MP."

        "content": "A shadow cabinet minister has spoken about how she carries a police alarm with her everywhere amid heightened concerns over the security of politicians. Labour MP Lisa Nandy, the shadow international development secretary, has spoken about the extra security precautions she has had to take, including only seeing her constituents by appointment. Speaking to Times Radio, Nandy said: “Instead of doing publicly advertised surgeries, we now do them by appointment. We have security present. I carry a police alarm everywhere that I go. I have security on my home. “And that is a really very typical experience for members of parliament … I went to a party meeting just last week and had people gathering around the entrance of that, shouting ‘genocide’ and accusing me and others of committing genocide. “We’ve had a couple of senior members of the shadow cabinet surrounded by people as they were going about canvassing, being filmed on their phones, and very aggressive comments about their own families. There was the Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who had people outside of his home.” Several MPs across the Commons have spoken about the increase in abuse and threats since the outbreak of war in the Middle East in October. The Sunday Times reported that three female MPs have been given taxpayer-funded bodyguards and cars. The women, who include both Labour and Tory MPs, had their security upgraded after a risk assessment. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, revealed on Sunday that he had received death threats and said that MPs got them “routinely”, telling Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: “I think it’s sadly the case that many members have been threatened and, indeed, that has been the case in relation to me as well. “All of us, unfortunately, face threats of violence, death threats and so on, in varying degrees. I’ve never had one that has been of the most serious nature, but we routinely receive these kinds of threats,” Dowden added. Rishi Sunak said MPs had been “verbally threatened and physically, violently targeted” in recent weeks as protests were “hijacked by extremists to promote and glorify terrorism”. The prime minister added that it was “the latest in an emerging pattern which should not be tolerated”. Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, has come under pressure after he broke with protocol last week to allow votes on three separate propositions from the three main parties relating to a ceasefire in Gaza. Some Conservative and Scottish National party MPs have called for the speaker to resign over the decision, which ultimately benefited Labour by allowing it to dodge a difficult vote. By the end of the week 71 MPs had put their names to a motion expressing no confidence in Hoyle, and the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, publicly said he thought Hoyle should go. An emotional Hoyle told MPs on Wednesday he had taken his decision because he was fearful of an attack on MPs. “I don’t ever want to go through the situation of picking up a phone to find that a friend, of whatever side, has been murdered by terrorists,” he said. “I also don’t want another attack on this house.” On Sky, Dowden refused to back Hoyle and said “the speaker has serious questions to answer about what happened and that’s what the leader of the house will be asking about on Monday”. The SNP is now pushing for a so-called “meaningful vote” on a ceasefire in Gaza and has written to Keir Starmer and Ed Davey inviting them to discussions about its wording. The SNP is proposing parliament mandates the UK government to use its position on the UN security council to vote for an immediate ceasefire, and follow the advice of independent UN experts to halt all transfers of military equipment and technology, including components, to Israel, and to suspend the issuing of new licences. Flynn said: “After the shameful scenes at Westminster last week, it’s vital the UK parliament urgently focuses on what really matters, doing everything we can to help secure an immediate ceasefire and lasting peace in Gaza and Israel.” The party claims its actions “forced” Starmer to do a U-turn on his opposition to calling for an immediate ceasefire and said MPs must “work together” to get Sunak to do the same."

        "content": "Rafael Behr is right in so many ways about current political priorities (‘Get the Tories out’ will carry the election, but it won’t fix the faultlines of a broken politics, 21 February), but seems to misunderstand the role and purpose of citizens’ assemblies.  In this country, decisions are not “delegated” to citizens’ assemblies. They are part of decision-making processes but have never, to my knowledge, ever actually taken decisions. The Irish discussions on abortion and same-sex marriage had citizens’ assemblies which discussed the issues that then went to referendums. The assemblies themselves did not take the decision. This is one of the aspects of citizens’ assemblies that has been criticised in some quarters – their lack of bindingness. Citizens’ assemblies have informed policy processes; elected politicians can then make final decisions with a greater understanding of citizens’ views and values on the issue. Equally, citizens’ assemblies are not an alternative to proportional representation (PR). PR, reform of the House of Lords and better and greater use of citizens’ assemblies (among other things) can each play a part in transforming our politics in different ways. For example, a citizens’ assembly could consider different models of PR that could then be debated and put to a referendum and parliamentary processes. PR alone will not fix the problem, nor will any of the other potential reforms. Together, they could be transformative.Diane OrdishBrighton • While correctly pointing out the malignant consequences of the first past the post system, Rafael Behr asserts that “there are sensible objections to PR based on preserving intimacy between MPs and their constituents”. This is tosh: the single transferable vote system combines proportionality with voters directly electing MPs within enlarged constituencies. Parties don’t like the idea because it enables people to vote across party lines if they so choose, ie it gives real power to the people. It’s disappointing that a progressive writer like Behr appears to not to have considered a type of PR that retains one of the few merits of FPTP. John WardLondon • Rafael Behr says that “any party that wins power through first past the post loses any incentive to reform the system”. This is demonstrably untrue. Since 1945, the existing electoral system has given power to the Tories twice as often as to Labour. When the Conservatives regain power, they tend to undo the good things Labour has done (eg the cancellation of the Sure Start programme). A move to PR would be in Labour’s best interests: it would relegate the Tories to a rump, and Labour would probably be the largest party in a series of coalitions. The 2022 Labour conference voted for a move to PR, but Keir Starmer dismissed it. It seems that Labour leaders would rather lose power than share it. Christopher ForenLeeds • I found much with which to agree in Rafael Behr’s article, but his “sensible objection” to PR “based on preserving intimacy between MPs and their constituents” left me open-mouthed. MPs are mostly voted for by fewer than half of their electorate, leaving the majority of constituents a long way from any representation, let alone intimacy. With PR, almost every constituent would enjoy representation at least, intimate or not. I long for that opportunity.Tom SerpellEast Hoathly, East Sussex  • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

That may be true, at first, but he misses the point that with two seemingly parallel paths, even a small amount of divergence – eg by one degree – will result in a gap that widens over time.

        "content": "The Tory party chair, Richard Holden, actioned a £10,000 salary top-up for Lee Anderson last autumn, in a sign of how much he was valued as deputy chair. Anderson, who is the MP for Ashfield, lost the Tory whip on Saturday after saying that Islamists had “got control” of Sadiq Khan and that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”. He was the party’s deputy chair until a month ago, when he resigned to rebel over the government’s Rwanda bill. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Holden wrote to Anderson on 24 November that his deputy role would now come with the salary top-up. Holden had just been made chair, replacing Greg Hands. In his letter, he confirmed Anderson would remain a deputy chair and said the role came with “a basic salary of £10,000 per annum payable in monthly arrears for the period of you being in place”. A Tory official said that Anderson was ultimately never paid any of the top-up as the internal paperwork was not processed before his resignation. However, Holden’s decision to sanction the salary top-up demonstrates how Anderson’s contributions as deputy chair were valued under the current Conservative party leadership. Anderson was made a deputy chair by Rishi Sunak in February last year. The appointment divided the party, triggering concern among centrist Tory MPs who thought his penchant for making incendiary remarks repelled moderate voters. Hands, who was chair at the time of Anderson’s appointment, took the decision not to pay him the £10,000 salary that ordinarily comes with the role because Anderson had started earning £100,000 a year as a presenter on GB News at about the same time. The party’s decision changed after the last cabinet reshuffle in November, when Hands was demoted to trade minister and Holden replaced him as chair. Anderson’s comments about Khan on GB News on Friday were met with outrage from across the political spectrum including from some senior Tories, forcing the party to act.   Related: Former justice secretary calls out Tory party colleagues over ‘dangerous’ rhetoric   But the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, did not rule out re-admitting Anderson to the Conservative parliamentary party. Dowden told Times Radio on Sunday: “We gave him the opportunity to apologise. Of course, if he apologises, we’d look at the nature of that and make a determination at that point. But that’s a matter for the chief whip.” Separately, Dowden told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that if Anderson had apologised he would not have lost the whip. Anderson resigned as deputy chair in mid-January to vote for a rightwing amendment that would have toughened up the government’s Rwanda deportation bill. No 10 indicated soon after that Sunak would be open to welcoming Anderson back to the role at a later date. The prime minister’s press secretary said in late January: “I think we can say that we have a lot of time for Lee. He made it clear that he had concerns but actually he really supports getting this deterrent up and running.”"

        "published_date": "2024-02-25T16:59:38+00:00",
        "content": "Britain’s largest Muslim group has written to the Conservative party to call for an investigation into “structural Islamophobia” within the party’s ranks. In a letter addressed to the Conservative chair, Richard Holden, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said Islamophobia in the party was “institutional, tolerated by the leadership and seen as acceptable by great swathes of the party membership”. The secretary general of the MCB, Zara Mohammed, wrote that “Islamophobia was on public display this week” and highlighted inflammatory comments made by the former home secretary Suella Braverman, the former Tory party deputy chair Lee Anderson and the former prime minister Liz Truss. The letter said Braverman’s article last week in the Daily Telegraph, in which she wrote that “Islamists … are in charge”, fell into a “well-trodden Islamophobic path”. The letter also addressed Anderson’s comments on GB News where he claimed “Islamists” had “got control” of London and the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. Anderson, who had the Conservative whip withdrawn from him after refusing to apologise, was criticised by the MCB for engaging in “Islamophobic tropes”. In a statement on Saturday after a call from the chief whip, Anderson said: “I understand the difficult position that I have put both he and the prime minister in with regard to my comments. I fully accept that they had no option but to suspend the whip in these circumstances.” Khan said Anderson’s comments were “Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist” and that they “pour fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred”. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, declined to say on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg whether Anderson’s comments were Islamophobic. He also said the MP would have kept his job had he apologised.   Related: Former justice secretary calls out Tory party colleagues over ‘dangerous’ rhetoric   Tell Mama, a charity that records anti-Muslim incidents, said there were 2,010 cases of Islamophobic hate during a four-month period from 7 October – a steep rise from the 600 recorded in the same period of the previous year. Truss was also criticised by the MCB for engaging in what it said was an “Islamophobic trope”. The former PM, who recently appeared in an interview with the far-right commentator Steve Bannon, claimed a “radical jihadist party” could send someone to parliament and remained silent when Bannon described the far-right figure Tommy Robinson as a “hero”. The letter by the MCB said: “There is no radical Islamic party – this is false and Islamophobic to play to this trope of Muslims taking over”. In response to such incidents, the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, accused Rishi Sunak of harbouring “extremists in his party”. Speaking to the Observer, Starmer said: “Whether it is Liz Truss staying silent on Tommy Robinson, or Suella Braverman’s extreme rhetoric, Rishi Sunak’s weakness means Tory MPs can act with impunity.” An investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative party found there was no institutional racism in the party in 2021, although some party members shared concerns that Muslims were excluded from the inquiry. Mohammed said the MCB had shared the letter with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to encourage Holden “to take this complaint seriously and take actions”."

        "published_date": "2024-02-25T15:50:13+00:00",
        "content": "Lee Anderson, the former miner turned MP for Ashfield, has caused more controversy in his four-and-a-bit years in parliament than most of the 2019 intake combined.  Before he was even elected, Labour was calling for him to be sacked, after he suggested nuisance social housing tenants should be evicted into tents and made to pick vegetables. But winding up Labour is one of Anderson’s greatest talents. He learned exactly which buttons to press, having served as office manager to Ashfield’s last Labour MP, Gloria De Piero, and sat as a Labour councillor on Ashfield district council. His ability to make Labour look prissy, and to say the unsayable in his broad Nottinghamshire yowl, was exactly why he was so prized by the Conservatives as a one-man unmoderated comments section. “Fuck off back to France,” he told asylum seekers complaining about their accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm barge.  In Anderson’s world, foreign prisoners are living it up in “comfy cells”, only avoiding deportation because of “lefty lawyers”. He once responded to a Labour MP expressing concerns about the prejudice faced by Gypsies and Travellers by saying that the Travellers in his constituency were less likely to “flog” you lucky heather than “be seen leaving your garden shed at 3 o’clock in the morning, probably with your lawnmower and half of your tools”. For the Tories he was a useful counterpart to Rishi Sunak, with his £180 “smart mug”, and extravagantly rich wife. They believed he could woo the kind of voters who were turned off by Sunak’s expensive shoes and Jacob Rees-Mogg’s accent. They liked him showing his tattooed arms on GB News – proof, they hoped, that the party of pinstripes and privilege was now also the home of the inked-up working man. That’s how he rose to become party vice-chair last February, just days after giving an interview in which he went decidedly off-piste and expressed his support for the death penalty. The Conservatives had no plans to bring back executions, but would it be so bad for them if Anderson reached the not insubstantial minority of the electorate who remain in favour of the ultimate punishment? Similarly, when Anderson announced in 2021 that he would be boycotting the England football team in protest at their taking the knee before matches, his party left him to his own devices, reasoning that large swathes of the population probably shared his view. His views on women leave much to be desired. Cheryl Butler, the Labour leader of Ashfield council during Anderson’s tenure, told the Observer he was turned down in 2018 when he reapplied to be a Labour councillor, partly for his views on equality and diversity. “He was misogynistic,” Butler said. “In his interview, he said that a woman’s place was at home in the kitchen with the children.” Such opinions might have prompted his exit from Labour, but they were arguably viewed as a plus point for many in the Conservatives. But on Saturday, Anderson finally went too far, after he told GB News that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had “given our capital city away to his mates”. “I don’t actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they’ve got control of Khan, and they’ve got control of London,” he said. He refused to resign, and so had the whip withdrawn. But will he now be expelled from the party, making him unable to stand for the Conservatives in the next general election, whenever that may be? Don’t be so sure. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, has left the door open for his return. Anderson’s words were “not acceptable”, said Dowden. But, he added: “Of course, if he apologises, we’d look at the nature of that and make a determination at that point. But that’s a matter for the chief whip.”"

        "content": "Robert Buckland has launched a broadside against Lee Anderson, Suella Braverman and Liz Truss and said that any Conservative politician intent on stoking division “had better get out and join another party”.\nBuckland, the Tory MP for South Swindon and a former justice secretary, criticised his colleagues for “dangerous” rhetoric in the past week.\nThe Conservatives have been warring over a series of interventions and remarks where Tory MPs have flirted with far-right sentiment.\nLee Anderson, who was deputy chair of the party until a month ago, told GB News on Friday that Islamists had “got control of” Sadiq Khan and that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”. He was stripped of the Tory whip after refusing to apologise.\nBuckland told Broadcasting House on BBC Radio 4 that Anderson’s remark was “racist” and “repugnant”. “This man has crossed a line, very clearly,” he said. “A number of colleagues, notably Sajid Javid, me and others, noted this and expressed our view, and the party’s acted.\n“It is wrong to conflate whole groups of people that are based on race or ethnicity with extremists. To start to conflate issues is dangerous. If it’s being done deliberately, then it is absolutely unacceptable. Even if it’s being done inadvertently, it’s careless, it’s reckless, and it doesn’t help us deal with the serious issues.”\nThe deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on BBC One that he did not believe Anderson was “intending to be Islamophobic”. He would have kept the whip had he apologised, Dowden said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAsked about Braverman’s claim that Islamists were running the country, Dowden said he disagreed but that her remarks were “in a different category” because they were not directed at any individual. “I don’t believe that what Suella has said crosses the line in the way that Lee Anderson’s comments do,” he said.\nBraverman, a former home secretary under Rishi Sunak, wrote in the Telegraph last week that “the truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now”.\nAsked about her comments, Buckland said: “To then say that we are being controlled or that they are in charge is, I think, to ramp things up in a way that is inaccurate, unnecessary and doesn’t actually allow us to have a proper debate to confront these people on an accurate basis.”\nBuckland was also asked about Liz Truss, the former prime minister, who took part in an interview with Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist to Donald Trump, and remained silent as Bannon hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson as a “hero”.\nBuckland said: “It beggars belief to know what on earth was going on there … It is important that when people like this are being lauded as some sort of hero, that there’s challenge.\n“Any sort of suggestion that somehow this is a real conservatism and that people like me are Conservatives in name only is the opposite of the truth.”\n“What we stand for, proper Conservatives stand for, is bringing the country together and seeking to unify, challenging criminality and hate and extremism absolutely square on, and being honest and truthful about it – but bringing the country together, not dividing it.\n“That’s what the proper Conservative vision is. That’s what the Conservative party that I joined believes in, and anybody else who doesn’t agree with that agenda and wants to fight had better get out and join another party, because that is not the Conservative party that I and millions of others believe in.”\nDuring the 2022 Tory leadership contest, Buckland initially supported Sunak but then switched to Truss.\n\n Related: Muslim group calls for Tory inquiry into party’s ‘structural Islamophobia’ \n\nIn an apparent swipe at Sunak, who appointed Anderson and Braverman to senior roles, Buckland said: “People talk about rottweilers or attack dogs in politics. The danger with having attack dogs with a licence to roam free is that sometimes they bite you on the hand, and that’s what’s been happening.”\nDowden told the BBC that Truss “should have called it out” when Bannon lauded Robinson.\nDuring her trip to the US last week, Truss said she would like to see Nigel Farage become a Tory party member and suggested she could work with him to reshape the party.\nDowden insisted that Farage would not be welcome. “I, like many hundreds of thousands of Conservatives up and down the country, have spent many years campaigning against parties led by Nigel Farage,” he told Sky News. “So no, I don’t support Nigel Farage to be joining the Conservative party.”\nThere is speculation that since losing the Tory whip, Anderson could join the rightwing populist party Reform UK, which is linked to Farage.\nRichard Tice, the Reform UK leader, said he was not in touch with Anderson. “As far as I’m concerned, this appears to be an internal squabble within the Conservative party about language,” he told Times Radio."

        "published_date": "2024-02-25T11:00:56+00:00",
        "content": "Labour is being warned by a powerful alliance of thinktanks and charities that poverty will soar if it comes to power and then fails to spend many billions of pounds on welfare reform to help those struggling most with the cost of living. The Observer understands that shadow work and benefits secretary Liz Kendall met representatives of several organisations, including the centre-left IPPR thinktank which is influential in Labour’s policy debate, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the independent Resolution Foundation, whose president is former Tory minister David Willetts, and Save the Children at a round table last week at which serious concerns were raised. With a general election approaching and Labour well ahead in the polls, pressure is now growing on Keir Starmer’s party to flesh out its policies on welfare at a time of acute cost of living pressure, and how it will help more people into stable, sustainable work. But with the party desperate to be seen as fiscally responsible, frustration is growing among some in policy circles at its lack of ambition. A new report by IPPR and Changing Realities, a research project looking at the experiences of families living on low incomes, identifies the two key challenges as being measures to tackle poverty, and policies to open opportunities to good quality work. It says 14.4 million people in the UK are now in poverty, with the situation set to worsen without radical change. “Poverty and extreme financial hardship have become acute problems,” the new report says. “With wages at a standstill over the last decade, recent soaring prices came at a time when many households were already struggling to meet essential costs. While some have seen their earnings increase in the period since the cost of living crisis started, for many the damage had already been done. Use of foodbanks has reached unprecedented levels, and there has been a sharp rise in households taking out loans to cover bills and daily spending.” It says that “people on low incomes too often cycle between low-paid, insecure roles and stints of unemployment” with the number of “economically inactive” people (those out of work and not actively looking for work) at record levels. “For too long, our welfare state has taken a punitive approach, ignoring individual motivations and challenges and wasting resources on approaches to that simply don’t work.” The reports adds: “Decisive action in these areas will also be essential for any government working to break down the barriers that have held back our economy.” A package of measures put forward by IPPR and Changing Realities includes: increasing the core entitlement for all households on universal credit by £50 a month, which it says alone would lift 350,000 people out of poverty: removing the two-child limit on benefit entitlements, and the benefit cap, to tackle child poverty and restore the link between entitlement and need; and tackling the five-week wait before new claimants receive payments. These measures together, the report says, would lift one million people out of poverty at an estimated cost of £12bn a year, while boosting the economy at the same time. Mel Wilkes, associate director for work and the welfare state at IPPR, said: “We know that millions of people across the country are struggling to get by. Our welfare state is letting them down – as it operates now, universal credit doesn’t protect people from poverty, and the five-week wait coupled with large debt deductions are pushing people in crisis into real hardship. These short-term reforms could be quickly adopted by any government, helping to lift families out of poverty, and make sure that people are meaningfully better off in work.” Last autumn Labour supported uprating benefits in line with inflation. But it remains opposed to ending the two-child limit, which means children in larger families are not eligible for child payments under universal credit. Last week Starmer announced plans to reform incapacity benefit and to encourage more young people into work with new teams of employment officers. A Resolution Foundation spokesperson said its most recent report “included a call to link both working-age and pensioner benefits to earnings, to introduce a new unemployment insurance scheme to help people move jobs, and to reduce child poverty by abolishing the benefit cap and two child-limit on welfare support.” The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said it was calling on all parties to urgently address entrenched high levels of poverty by introducing an ‘Essentials Guarantee’ into Universal Credit. This would ensure that everyone has a protected minimum amount of support to afford essentials like food and household bills. The policy would cost an additional £22bn a year. A top priority for Save the Children is ending the two-child limit on Universal Credit payments. A Labour spokesperson said: “One in five people trapped in poverty is the devastating consequence of 14 years of Tory misery. The responsibility lies firmly at the feet of a failed government that has crashed the economy and unleashed a cost of living crisis, pushing families into poverty right across the country. “Labour is committed to fixing this Tory failure. Our plan to tackle the root causes of poverty will grow the economy to put money back into people’s pockets, reform social security, create well-paid jobs, and deliver a bold, new cross-government child poverty strategy.”"

But when the people of Rochdale go to the polls on Thursday, they have barely anyone to protest against.  The Labour and Green parties have ditched their candidates. The Conservative was abroad on a long-planned family holiday the week before polling day. The Lib Dem remains, but pulled out of the most high-profile political event, a local BBC radio debate. The most energetic campaigning last week came instead from the political fringe: George Galloway, serial byelection winner and founder of the Workers Party of Britain, and Simon Danczuk, the town’s former Labour MP who was suspended by the party for sexting a 17-year-old girl and is now standing for Reform UK. “We don’t deserve this,” said Margaret King, standing outside Marks & Spencer. “This town does not deserve to be this short of anybody decent to vote for.” This time she’s ­voting for one of the local independents. “We’ve been Lib Dem for a long time, back to Cyril Smith, but when I think back I can’t believe I voted for him. There’s too many shadows on this town.” It’s true that Rochdale’s shadows are long: Smith’s decades of child abuse and the grooming gangs whose teenage victims were failed by police are the most obvious. But the town, on the edge of Greater Manchester, notable as the birthplace of the modern co-operative movement and once one of the world’s foremost cotton processing centres, has other issues too. The Wheatsheaf shopping centre has been shut down and outside the town centre there is a proliferation of pawn shops and people sleeping rough. There is also a shiny new shopping precinct called Riverside and the newly revamped town hall – an imposing neo-Gothic building which, Rochdalians are quick to remind visitors, Hitler was so impressed by that he wanted it dismantled and rebuilt in Bavaria. A little way south is Milkstone Road, thriving with south Asian restaurants, halal butchers and sweet shops selling laddoo, burfee and other treats popular with the 30% of Rochdale residents who are Muslim, many of Pakistani, Kashmiri or Bangladeshi origin. Galloway has done much of his campaigning around here, and on Friday he toured the mosques to talk to worshippers as they spilled out on to the pavements after prayers. The 69-year-old has made Gaza his focus in an appeal to Muslims horrified by events there and dismayed that Keir Starmer has not taken a stronger stance on the issue. “My father supported Labour, my mother, my uncle, my sisters, my brothers,” said Maqsood Ahmad, sitting in a branch of Chaiiwala having heard Galloway’s pitch. “But they are not listening to us. You can’t tell the difference between them and the government. “George Galloway may not be able to do anything about it, but the message we’re sending is ‘Don’t take our vote for granted.’” Only 60% of British Muslims who voted Labour in 2019 plan to do so again this year. Galloway hopes those in Rochdale will be more motivated, and therefore more important if turnout is low. He is a veteran of byelection campaigns, having defeated Labour in polls in Bradford West and in Bethnal Green and Bow, but lost his attempt in 2021 to win Batley and Spen amid accusations of homophobia and dirty tricks. Rochdale had its own minor controversy on Thursday, when Galloway was invited to speak at a community hustings with several other candidates except Danczuk, who was initially barred from entering the building, and later offered a two-minute slot which he refused. In the end, few other candidates showed up except Galloway and Lib Dem Iain Donaldson. Danczuk seems to have spent more time than Galloway in villages such as Littleborough and Milnrow on the edge of the Pennines, but on Friday he was also trying to engage voters in Milkstone Road, handing out Reform UK leaflets. “I think Gaza is an issue for a vocal minority,” he said, adding that the main issue was illegal immigration with Rochdale taking “a disproportionate number of asylum seekers over the years”. Back in the town centre, people at the Regal Moon were surprised to learn that the Wetherspoons pub was the official headquarters of the Monster Raving Loony party candidate. Some drinkers there raised immigration as an issue, although none considered Reform UK to be an option. “Danczuk has been here before and he didn’t do anything then,” said David Brierley, after complaining how much the town’s ethnic makeup has changed. People here have not heard from Azhar Ali since Labour withdrew support for him, but his name will remain on the ballot paper, along with Guy Otten, the former Green candidate.   Related: An all-male byelection ballot in Rochdale? That’s hardly taking the Suffragette line | Catherine Bennett   “I reckon he’ll still get in,” said one drinker, referring to Ali. “People think that it will all settle down afterwards.” Yet overall, few people here seem engaged with the byelection, and are closer to Margaret King’s disappointment with the candidates on offer from the main parties. Between showers a queue has formed outside one of Rochdale’s soup kitchens, in Drake Street, and Muhammad Aziz has a shopping trolley of food collected from local businesses and families to give away, offering bread, muffins and cakes to people. “I do this every day,” he said. “Rochdale has a lot of deprivation and a lot of poverty. We’re trying to make Rochdale better again, help people back on their feet.” And how will he vote? “I’m a Conservative,” he says. “The Tories are the people who can bring the money from London.”"

        "content": "The week had started well for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC). Keir Starmer had finally backed calls for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the Prince of Wales had raised his concerns about the appalling loss of life in Gaza. But on Saturday, as more than 200 people gathered at Conway Hall in London for the campaign’s annual general meeting, optimism that the debate over the Middle East might be turning the PSC’s way had been superseded by puzzlement – and some anger. “It’s not extremist to be against the war,” said Fiona Goldie, an activist from Carlisle in Cumbria. “It’s the norm to want peace.” She was referring to suggestions that pro-Palestinian activists like her had been in some way responsible for the chaotic scenes that had unfolded inside the House of Commons on Wednesday and Thursday, during a debate on the Middle East conflict. For months MPs have reported feeling intimidated by pro-Palestinian activists in their constituencies and online. The murder in October 2021 in Essex of the Tory MP David Amess by an Islamist extremist remains fresh in their minds. But last week the accusations against pro-Palestinian campaigners widened. The front page of Saturday’s Times reported that the PSC had been trying to sabotage British democracy, no less, and force parliament into lockdown to advance its cause. Goldie, and others with her, seemed anything but extreme in their methods or views as they went about their business yesterday. She told how she and friends had handed out leaflets for months in Carlisle town centre most Saturday lunchtimes. The public, she insisted, was “overwhelmingly sympathetic”. “The feedback we get from somewhere as non-political as Carlisle is that people are outraged. They want our government to do something.” But with feelings over events in Gaza running high, and as the UK heads towards a general election that has increased the heat of the conflict between parties in the House of Commons, arguments over Israel and Gaza have become entangled with domestic Westminster politics and the entire debate has turned toxic. On Friday, the twice-sacked Tory home secretary, Suella Braverman, claimed that “Islamist cranks and leftwing extremists” had taken control of the UK’s streets. It was all part of a leftwing agenda, she said. The Conservative MP Lee Anderson said Islamists had “got control of London” and that its Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan had “given our capital city away to his mates”. Many of those heading through the winter sunshine towards Conway Hall wore the keffiyeh, the black and white scarf that has come to symbolise the Palestinian cause. But Roshan Pedder, from Surrey, proudly showed off her African National Congress scarf, as a symbol of hope, and to demonstrate that those who had come to the meeting were from a long and wide tradition of peace campaigning. “We faced down Reagan and Thatcher [who were] holding out to the bitter end against sanctions,” she said. “And we pressed and pressed and pressed and eventually it burst.” Pedder rejected the idea that demonstrating outside an MP’s office was wrong. “I don’t see how it can be intimidating as long as it’s peaceful,” she said. “Isn’t talking to our MPs what we’re supposed to do in a democracy?” On Thursday morning, British democracy was very much in the frame. After 24 hours of furious and unseemly argument over the handling of a debate in the House of Commons on a Gaza ceasefire by the speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman rose to declare the behaviour of his colleagues a disgrace. Vicious political point-scoring had drowned out serious debate on events in Gaza, and whether calling for a ceasefire was now the best way forward. “It was shameful that the BBC had to blank off the proceedings at one stage because of the crude and vile language that was coming from one end of the chamber,” said Sheerman. A senior Tory MP roamed the Commons corridors in a state of fury at the way the house had failed to conduct a civilised, serious and dignified discussions on the Israel-Gaza question, of all issues. “It is a fucking disgrace. We are now in a row with ourselves, among ourselves, debating whether to kick out the speaker of the House of Commons, rather than the issue at hand, which could not be more serious. It is the most depressing day of my life as an MP.” Hoyle’s troubles had begun the previous morning, when he decided to go against the advice of his own officials and select a Labour amendment, as well as a government one, to an SNP opposition day motion calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Normally only the government can put down an amendment to an opposition day motion but Hoyle had gone out on a limb. The SNP’s motion was for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire, with the onus on Israel, and it mentioned what it called the Netanyahu government’s “collective punishment” of Palestinians. Labour’s amendment, meanwhile, was for an “immediate, humanitarian ceasefire” observed by all. It condemned the terrorism of Hamas, while also demanding the release of hostages, and calling on Israel to stop its bombardment. The government amendment did not call for an immediate ceasefire but put the emphasis on a humanitarian pause to the conflict, working towards a ceasefire. Hoyle, who used to sit on the Labour benches before becoming speaker, had, as a result, left himself wide open to accusations of pro-Labour bias, and of helping Starmer avoid the damaging prospect of seeing many of his pro-ceasefire MPs rebel by voting for the SNP motion calling for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire. Many Labour MPs felt under pressure from constituents to show they backed a ceasefire. If Labour’s own amendment wasn’t selected, backing the SNP motion would have been the only way to answer those voters. One senior Labour MP said: “Everyone knew that the SNP had chosen the issue of a Gaza ceasefire for their opposition day solely to expose splits on our side. It was entirely cynical on their part. I think Hoyle was right to do what he did. Opposition days are supposed to be occasions when the opposition parties criticise the government. This SNP opposition day was different. It was designed to attack Labour.” If no Labour amendment had been allowed, and Starmer had been left to whip his MPs to abstain, this could have seen mass resignations, as happened with the likes of Jess Phillips when a similar situation occurred last November. “The situation was really tense at the top,” said one Labour source. “There were fears that at least two shadow cabinet members would have resigned. There would have been a big rebellion that would have seriously damaged Keir.” There were reports, denied by Labour and Hoyle, that with this in mind team Starmer had made clear to the speaker that the party would not back his re-election at the start of the next parliament unless he called the Labour amendment. What ensued was undignified chaos as Hoyle felt the full force of Tory and SNP fury. Both parties had in interest in exposing Labour splits. When the clerk of the house, Tom Goldsmith, wrote an official note for publication to record that the speaker had gone against convention and his advice, the Tories withdrew from the process and the votes. Labour’s amendment passed and the SNP motion was never voted on, though it had been its opposition day in the first place. Immediately SNP MPs suggested that Hoyle’s position was untenable. On Wednesday night there were rowdy scenes, worse than any many could recall. Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons, desperate to score political points, accused the speaker of having “hijacked” the debate and “undermined the confidence of the Commons.” The SNP milked the occasion for all it was worth, saying the whole episode had shown the contempt with which Westminster regarded Scotland’s ruling party and the third biggest party in the Commons. “We have seen the SNP opposition day turn into a Labour opposition day and I’m afraid that that is treating myself and my colleagues in the Scottish National party with complete and utter contempt,” said Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster. On Thursday, a tearful and clearly sleep-deprived Hoyle made his second apology to the house in 12 hours for what he admitted had been a serious error of judgment. “I apologise to the House. I made a mistake: we do make mistakes and I own up to mine.” But he made clear that in doing what he did he had had in mind the interests of all MPs, and that he had felt that those would be best served by allowing two amendments, Tory and Labour, as well the SNP motion, so all the main party positions could be laid out, Labour’s included. It had been for the very best of reasons, he said, to help not fan the flames. “I will defend every member in this House. Every member matters to me in this House. As has been said, I never, ever want to go through a situation where I pick up a phone to find a friend, on whatever side, has been murdered by a terrorist. I also do not want another [terrorist] attack on this House – I was in the chair on that day. I have seen, I have witnessed. I will not share the details, but the details of the things that have been brought to me are absolutely frightening for all members of the House, on all sides. I have a duty of care and I say that. If my mistake is looking after members, I am guilty.” This weekend, although more than 70 MPs have signed a motion expressing no confidence in the speaker, their efforts to oust him seem to have stalled, at least for now. Plenty of rightwing Tories have swung behind him, including the veteran Sir Edward Leigh, who said it was time to move on and have another debate as soon as possible on a government motion, with all amendments considered “to restore our reputation as soon as possible”. Back at Conway Hall on Saturday, Pedder wondered how ordinary people could get their voices through. Referring to the behaviour of the main parties and their MPs, she said: “These were people applying archaic rules that nobody understood. We have a system that does not allow the public voice to enter parliament. MPs were looking after their vote banks instead of looking at the genocide – there’s no other word for it – in Gaza, and the in­justices over the last 75 years that the Palestinian people have suffered.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak attended a protest alongside a group which has posted conspiracy theories about climate change, and which campaigns against net zero, the Observer can reveal. The prime minister has been accused of “pandering to extremists” by farmers and wildlife groups, who have asked him to “listen to reason and logic” rather than conspiracy theories. Sunak has been making a concerted effort to improve his party’s standing in rural areas after polling showed the majority of countryside seats are likely to be lost to Labour and the Liberal Democrats at the next general election. Last week, he gave the keynote address at the National Farmers’ Union conference where he told farmers “I have your back.” On Friday, he attended a farmers’ protest against the Welsh Labour government, which is proposing to bring in a new payments scheme in which farmers will have to prove 10% of their land is woodland and 10% of it is quality habitat for wildlife. He appeared alongside farmer Gareth Wyn Jones and stood next to placards emblazoned with the logo for the campaign “No Farmers No Food”. Wyn Jones is a leading supporter of the campaign, which was started and is being run by James Melville, a GB News pundit and communications consultant. Sunak joined in the protest, along with Andrew RT Davies the Welsh Conservatives leader, telling those assembled with their tractors that they had been “treated as Labour’s laboratory”. Speaking to Wyn Jones, he said the new subsidies scheme was “absolutely not right, the impact it will have on your jobs, your livelihoods, your incomes and food production around the country. It’s simply wrong.” The No Farmers No Food campaign is anti net-zero and has shared conspiracy theories about climate change action, while Melville has questioned the effects of climate breakdown as well as sharing conspiracy theories about net zero. Its manifesto accuses the UK government of having an “obsession with net zero” and calls for it to end climate measures. The Twitter/X account for the group shared a conspiracy theory that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is going to force people to eat bugs to reach net zero, retweeting a post from former LBC host Maajid Nawaz that said: “Farmers stand between us and WEF’s desire for us to EAT BUGS, own nothing and be happy.” Melville also shared a post with the conspiracist claim which stated: “Between Bill Gates, the CCP & the WEF, we’re going to have no private farmland left. They want you eating bugs.” Melville has also shared fake news that local councils are forcing people into “climate lockdowns” and added: “Endless project fear. Very similar vibes on climate/net zero given off by the same people who pushed for lockdowns. And similar vilification issued against anyone who dares to question the narrative.” Craig Bennett, CEO of the Wildlife Trusts, said the prime minister’s appearance at the protest was “deeply worrying”, adding: “Rather than pandering to extremists who don’t know what they’re talking about, Sunak should be talking to the farmers who are doing their utmost to alleviate biodiversity loss and the impacts of climate change. It would be nice if the prime minister paid a bit more attention to science, reason and logic.” Arable farmer Martin Lines, CEO of the Nature Friendly Farming Network added: “We are already seeing significant impacts to our businesses and food production because of climate change and all the science says it is going to get significantly worse if we don’t reduce emissions. I find it very disappointing that the prime minister has gone to a protest for a group where one of their key asks is no to net zero measures.” A government spokesperson did not address the claims, but said: “We are on the side of farmers and – just this week – we announced a major new package of support for rural communities to protect British farming for the next generation.   Related: ‘Our yields are going to be appalling’: one of wettest winters in decades hits England’s farms   “This includes the largest ever grant offer for farmers in the coming financial year, expected to total £427m, including an unprecedented package of funding for technology and productivity schemes.” Melville told the Observer: “These are individual views and not to do with the campaign which includes a lot of different credible people. The farming campaign is not a slavish obsession with net zero, far from it. It is to point out a number of key issues.” On the opinions about climate lockdowns and the WEF forcing people to eat bugs, he said: “Every individual has a number of different viewpoints that they can openly express without being accused of being a conspiracy theorist.” He added that these climate views are not related to the farming campaign but are personal views. Gareth Wyn Jones has been contacted for comment. • This article was amended on 25 February 2024 because an earlier version said the Welsh government “has brought in a new payments scheme” for farmers. In fact the scheme is proposed and is under consultation."

        "content": "In last week’s BBC documentary Miners’ Strike: A Frontline Story, some of the history was inevitably told by those who were only coming of age in 1984. One of those was Lisa McKenzie, the daughter and granddaughter and great-granddaughter of Nottinghamshire miners, who turned 16 on the first day of the strike. Among other memories, McKenzie, now 55, recalled with a grin the time when a group calling themselves the Cambridge University Feminist Players had got in touch, back then, and wanted to come and do a play for the women of the pit village, in a show of solidarity. When the students arrived they insisted that only women could watch their performance. “None of the women liked that, and none of the men liked it either,” McKenzie recalled. The play itself, she said, was “every bit as bad as you could imagine: all avant garde and flounce.” As a finale, the student actors turned their backs to the audience and when they turned around their faces were blackened with coal dust. They held hands and announced: “One day all sisters will unite – and work side-by-side down the pits with their men!” McKenzie was open-mouthed recalling this, as her home-permed self had been open-mouthed first time around. “What that showed us,” she said, 40 years on, “is that they just didn’t understand us at all.” That persistent truth hasn’t, of course, stopped writers and film-makers and artists and poets, not many of them sons or daughters of miners, from trying to tell the story of mining and ex-mining communities ever since. The BBC documentary, and the three-part Channel 4 series that preceded it last month, Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain, are the latest expressions of what has become a national ritual, an alternative remembrance day, marking the dispute, decade by decade, when “Britain changed for ever”. The passage of time seems only to add poignancy to those acts of homage, to the stations of the cross at Easington and Ollerton and Orgreave. This time around the cameras dwelt on the faces of old men whose whole working life might have been spent below ground, but which instead had been spent in daylight, scratching around for piecemeal jobs, or benefits, or structure and certainty, in towns and villages that had been stripped – gradually and then suddenly – of their original purpose. The fascination with documenting those lives, wanting to walk in miners’ boots, has a long history. George Orwell set the pattern when he was dispatched from his day job at a Hampstead bookshop in 1936 by his publisher Victor Gollancz to live among the miners of Lancashire and Yorkshire for the book that became The Road to Wigan Pier. The Old Etonian prepared by scuffing his brogues and dirtying his jacket and trying to rough up his accent. His book dramatised, in part, all the ingrained ironies of that quest: “In a way it is even humiliating to watch coal miners working,” he wrote, drily. “It raises in you a momentary doubt about your own status as an ‘intellectual’ and a superior person generally. It is brought home to you, at least while you are watching, that it is only because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons can remain superior.”   Related: Tell us what it’s like to live in a UK former mining town in 2024   The miners he met were, equally, in no doubt of their relative status. Orwell may have had received pronunciation, but they had authenticity: “It is only in the North that life is ‘real’ life,” Orwell was invited to understand, and “that the industrial work done in the North is the only ‘real’ work, that the North is inhabited by ‘real’ people, the South merely by rentiers and their parasites.” The interviewees in the two recent documentaries seemed pretty sure of that distinction nearly 90 years on (and you could, too, hear an echo of Orwell’s southern insecurities in the occasional reedy-voiced off-screen questions of the programme-makers). What had been lost, the ex-miners implied, when the pits were shut down, was not so much a way of life as that whole confidence in what was real and what was fake. The mine at Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where the Channel 4 series focused, had been replaced by a vast Sports Direct warehouse. As Lisa McKenzie concluded: “The pit was life, it was everything. We might not have had much money, but we were honest folk. Love and safety and security: 1984 to 1985 removed all of that.” That abiding faith was the motivating force of the strike from the beginning. Ken Loach’s 1984 film Which Side Are You On? set the gritty romance of those threatened communities in stone. His camera captured not only the frontlines of the picket, but the poets and balladeers of the struggle playing benefits in pubs and clubs. “Tears too are now redundant,” one such pit-poet concluded. “Who am I to ask them why this pit must live, this pit must die?” another man inquired. Loach spliced those lyrical moments with the running battles of picketing miners: scenes of cars turned back on motorways blockaded by newly militarised police; the arms of broad shouldered pitmen twisted up their backs as they are bundled into paddy wagons; the police cavalry charges at Orgreave. Watching those latter sequences again now, some images seem to merge with memories of Jeremy Deller’s 2001 reconstruction of the same events for an art project. Deller, the Turner prize winner, who was at school in Dulwich, south London at the time of the strike itself, used re-enactment societies and ex-miners for his film to emphasise, lest we forget, that this recent history had been our civil war and our Agincourt, all in one. * * * The latest films and documentaries on the strike, like those that went before, are sometimes tempted to portray those clashes as part of a straightforward class war – workers against the capitalist state – but they were, on the ground, equally internecine conflicts, pit against pit. Reading back through the first draft of history in the Observer, those latter fault lines were apparent from the very beginning. On 11 March 1984, the Observer reported the initial walk out at Cortonwood pit in Yorkshire, under the heading “Miners Deeply Split” above a story about the refusal of the NUM leader, Arthur Scargill, to grant members a national ballot “on the basis that there were grave doubts as to whether the required 55% vote in favour of strike action could be achieved”. Those doubts never went away over the following 12 months, not least in the mind of Scargill himself, who attempted to assume national consensus in the union without that mandate.   Neil Kinnock maintained that ‘the suicidal vanity of Arthur Scargill’ made the catastrophic defeat of the strike inevitable   The following week, the paper reported from Thoresby colliery in Nottinghamshire, which had been targeted by flying pickets from Yorkshire, seeking to persuade or intimidate the Notts miners into walking out. One working miner railed at how “Scargill… is turning miner against miner. Every man must enjoy the democratic right to vote on whether he should go on strike or not. Scargill wants to use us as cannon fodder to bring down this government. I tell you if he were to turn up here, we’d string him up from the nearest lamp-post.” At nearby Ollerton, in street battles, one young Yorkshireman died. “Yorkshire pickets with football scarves around their necks taunted the Notts men with charges of cowardice,” the paper reported. “The Yorkshiremen accused the Nottinghamshire moderates of not being ‘real men’, of hiding behind their women, of failing to stand up when the crunch came. The chanting had all the savage edge of a football crowd on the rampage.” It is seductive, knowing how things turned out, to only view that history in black and white, comrades against strikebreakers. Looking back over depictions of the strike year by year is to watch voices for compromise quietly erased in favour of that simpler binary. One figure whose stance appears less and less in anniversary documentaries is Neil Kinnock, Labour leader at the time of the strike, born into a South Wales mining community, and engaged in 1984 in a battle for the future of his party with the hard left Militant group. In Marching to the Fault Line, Francis Beckett and David Hencke’s peerless account of the secret political manoeuvring of the strike, Kinnock emerges as a rare voice of reason. At the launch of that book, on the 25th anniversary of the strike in 2009, Kinnock doubled down on his opinion that “the suicidal vanity of Arthur Scargill” had made the catastrophic defeat of the strike inevitable. “A ballot would have been won for the strike,” Kinnock insisted. “And what it would have done is guarantee unity right across the mining labour force.” Scargill, he suggested, preyed on the strength of self-sacrifice in the community in order to “feed himself the political illusion that as long as the miners were united they had the right to destabilise and overthrow the democratically elected government. The miners didn’t deserve him, they deserved much, much better. My view is Margaret Thatcher and Arthur Scargill deserved each other. But no one else did.” That narrative, far more widespread at the time than the history now tends to believe, was no doubt the reason why Margaret Thatcher could look in the mirror and tell herself she was defending democracy when she was using covert and draconian strategies to provoke and break the strike. Forty years on, two seconds of footage of Thatcher in any of the latest documentaries, repeating her determination to defeat “the enemy within”, or to defend liberty with battalions of riot police, should still come with a trigger warning to anyone who sat through those broadcasts in real time. The patronising grate of the voice, the impervious certainty, the hair (mirrored by Scargill’s bouffant) still have the effect of a thousand nails down a blackboard. For these reasons – and despite her landslide electoral successes either side of 1984-5 – Mrs T has been the cold-hearted villain of just about all popular depictions of those events ever since. It was never enough for the most vocal striking miners to want the prime minister defeated, they wanted their tormentor safely dispatched underground, to be sure she had gone. Mark Herman’s 1996 film Brassed Off, about the Grimethorpe Colliery Band playing on while their pit faced closure, established that sentiment: “What’s [God] doing?” Stephen Tomkinson’s character asks at one point, “He can take John Lennon. He can take those three young lads down at Ainsley Pit. He’s even thinking of taking my old man. And Margaret bloody Thatcher lives! What’s He sodding playing at, eh?” For 20 years, retrospective fantasies along those lines were applauded every night on the London stage in the musical version of Lee Hall’s play Billy Elliot, set during the strike. Elton John’s song from that show, Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher (“we all celebrate today because it’s one day closer to your death”), was even sung on the night the former prime minister eventually died. “I was on holiday when she snuffed it,” Hall subsequently recalled. “Somehow the producers had tracked me down. They were asking permission to cut the ‘Thatcher’s dead’ song out of ‘respect’. I refused… The cast stopped the show and put it to an audience vote. Only three people voted against playing it and they walked out – the other 1,500 people sang along. Democracy in action.” * * * The most thoughtful unpicking of all that highly charged history was set out in James Graham’s fabulous 2022 BBC series Sherwood (a drama that prefigured the dystopia of The Way, the three-parter by Graham, Michael Sheen and the documentary-maker Adam Curtis). When Sherwood came out I was sent on a faintly Wigan Pier mission up to the former pit village of Annesley Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, where the drama was set, and where Graham had grown up, to ask ex-miners what they made of it. It remains a sobering experience to walk around those villages where the winding gear of the closed pit has become a heritage attraction; for one thing there is a sense of time having stopped; for another the high street and the faces both betray the marks of that longstanding dereliction. The primary inspiration for the fiction of Sherwood was the real-life murder of Keith Frogson, former trade unionist, who was killed with a crossbow on the 20th anniversary of the miners’ strike in 2004. The fissures of resentment that tragedy reopened remained raw 20 years on. One afternoon I sat talking to ex-colleagues of Frogson, one after the other, in front rooms that featured mantelpieces full of pit memorabilia, plates and badges and mugs. That evening, I received phone calls from each of those men saying that they wanted to withdraw their co-operation with my article. Their former NUM leader had been in touch, though none of them had worked in a mine for 30 years. The collective feeling was they’d had enough of “London media” coming up to try to understand; no one would step out of line, old habits dying hard.   A survey on Radio Nottingham last week said most people under 30 didn’t even know what the word ‘scab’ meant   Among the people who would speak was David Amos, a NUM official who had kept working during the strike and had subsequently written a PhD dissertation about that history. “Once Scargill came,” Amos told me, “the NUM was quite Orwellian. We said: ‘Are you asking us what to do or are you telling us?’ And they said: ‘We’re telling you.’ Notts miners had a different tradition to that.” Amos was still ostracised by many of the striking men he had grown up with and worked alongside, though the number was slowly dwindling. “It’s just played out by a few people these days,” he said. “It’s like ageing Jedi Knights battling it out and everyone else is wondering what the bloody hell’s going on. Apparently there was a survey on Radio Nottingham last week that said most people under 30 didn’t even know what the word ‘scab’ meant.” The final word in Graham’s Sherwood series was given to the widow of the murdered man, who suggested that the division between working people that took root during the strike was exactly what the Thatcher government had always planned. “A former mining town?” she asked a pub full of villagers. “How the hell are we to move on when we talk about ourselves in terms of what we aren’t any more? We’ve had 40 years of this. You get one bloody life and we are spending it hating. Aren’t you all tired? I am. So fucking tired…” One of the reasons that many mining families can’t move on from the events that brutally ended their imagined future 40 years ago is that, as Scargill predicted and perhaps precipitated, nothing has ever properly replaced that future. Another is that the backstory is endlessly rehearsed as a warmer contrast to the bleak present. Robert Gildea, emeritus professor of modern history at Oxford, last year published an oral history of the strike, Backbone of the Nation, that collected lengthy evidence from 148 interviewees. Many of their stories have long hardened into gospel; Gildea found that in their retelling they inexorably shaped the lives of children and grandchildren born after the strike ended and the pits closed. In some cases the knowledge of this unseen past appeared to prompt addiction and depression; elsewhere Gildea identified a group of miners’ children he came to think of as “redeemers”. “Like the others, they experienced the deprivation and pain of the strike and its defeat, and the devastation of its aftermath. But – exceptionally and consciously – they worked in later life to alleviate the ills suffered by the communities in which they had been brought up” – they became teachers, doctors, social workers, trying to knit the old social fabric back together. Ken Loach’s film The Old Oak, which came out at the end of last year, looked for similar threads of connection. Now 87, the film-maker said at the time of his film’s release that it would be his last production, and that it was fitting to return to the strike, since that was the event in his lifetime that most determined our precarious “gig economy” present. His film tells the story of TJ, an ex-miner in a run-down Durham town, who tries to integrate a family of Syrian refugees, who have been given a terraced house among the old miners’ back to backs. His old pit colleagues, who have only watched their community fray and decay, instead use the incomers as scapegoats for all their frustrations. TJ runs a pub, the Old Oak, the back room of which, with its miners’ banners and its photographs of the strike, has been locked up for 20 years. It becomes the battleground for another stand-off – between solidarity with destitute foreigners, and a bitter bigotry that stands in place of long-lost community. Watching that film reminded me of the long ago 2019 election. I was up in Tony Blair’s former constituency of Sedgefield, in Fishburn Working Men’s Club. Downstairs, in the party room, there was a battle-torn miners’ banner in a glass case bearing the face of Keir Hardie; the banner is still brought out each year to head the Durham miners’ parade. A few times, recently, I was told, that room had only been packed out to hear Nigel Farage speak. The walls of the main bar were decorated with paintings of the former Fishburn colliery which once employed nearly every family in the village and, in pride of place, a tableau of the “pits closed by the Tories”, each with its symbolic badge of arms. Underneath this memorial, on the night after the election, old miners and regulars at the club for 40 and 50 years explained to me, one after the other, how they had voted for Boris Johnson rather than Jeremy Corbyn at that election. “Corbyn doesn’t understand us here,” they insisted. It was a reminder that the battles of 1984 had been well and truly lost. Defending the community had come to seem something more desperate altogether. * * * Partly for that reason, the miners’ strike remains a storyline that keeps on giving. Over the past week a couple of new books have arrived on my desk. One is a thoughtful and lyrical novel by Andrew McMillan, born in south Yorkshire in 1988, in the shadow of those events. His book, Pity, is structured around the gaps between past and present; haunting memories of tragedy and hardship in generations of mining men and their sons, and academic “field workers” who try and fail to excavate them. The other is a book of poems by the Doncaster-born and Leeds-based poet Sarah Wimbush. That book, launched at the National Coal Mining Museum, is called simply Strike, and is inspired entirely by images of the conflict, a graphic emotional shorthand that all of us of a certain age know well: helmeted riot policemen in Victorian backstreets, miners’ wives marching under bedsheet banners, teenagers “riddling” bits of coal off slag heaps. The book is prefaced by a poem, Markham Main, about some of the men that the BBC might have mined for stories: “Afternoons they meet up/ on street corners/ like old youths planning revolution…” Wimbush writes. “After school they take the grand-kids/ to the Pit Top Playground, look forward/ to the night shift at Ikea. Together.” You are left to wonder a bit about that last word – the thing that was fought for, and perhaps the thing that was lost."

        "content": "Three female MPs have been given bodyguards and chauffeur-driven cars after concerns about their safety, it was reported. Representatives of the Conservative and Labour parties had their security upgraded after a risk assessment, according to the Sunday Times. The MPs, who have not been named, have been given close protection by private companies and chauffeur-driven vehicles. “Many MPs are petrified by the abuse they are facing,” a senior security source told the newspaper. Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, is understood to have been working with the Home Office, police chiefs and parliamentary authorities to bolster the safety and security of MPs. A new process has been introduced in recent weeks in which the royal and VIP executive committee (Ravec), responsible for the security of the royal family and senior politicians, has been deployed to help assess the threat to MPs, according to the Sunday Times. It comes after Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, recently warned of the growing threat to politicians from the far right. Hoyle also spoke of his deep concern about the security of MPs being a factor in his decision on Wednesday to break with precedent and allow Labour to table a vote during an SNP debate calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. He told MPs: “I will defend every member in this House. Both sides, I never ever want to go through a situation where I pick up a phone to find a friend, whatever side, has been murdered by terrorists. I also don’t want an attack on this House.” Hoyle added: “The details of the things that have been brought to me are absolutely frightening. I am guilty because I have a duty of care that I will carry out to protect people. It is the protection that led me to make the wrong decision.” Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered in 2016 by the far-right extremist Thomas Mair in Birstall, West Yorkshire, after a constituency meeting. Conservative MP Sir David Amess was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, in 2021 by Ali Harbi Ali, an Islamic State sympathiser."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-24T18:16:10+00:00",
        "content": "On a sunny day at Doncaster racecourse, those gathered for Reform UK’s “biggest ever party conference” were presented with a dizzying array of pledges to cut tax and ­freeze “non-essential” immigration as its leading lights published a ­programme to “save Britain”. Yet even as the sun beamed down, the shadow of one absent figure seemed to hang over proceedings. There was a jubilant mood at the South Yorkshire gathering as they cheered leader Richard Tice’s demands for an inquiry into vaccine harms, to break with the World Health Organization and to fire headteachers who refused to drop “critical race theory”. Even from the conference stage, however, it was acknowledged there was one big unanswered question. David White, the Barnsley South ­candidate, admitted he is regularly asked: “When’s Nigel coming back?” The leaders of Reform UK, which grew out of the Brexit party after the last election, are in optimistic mood after seizing 13% of the vote at the Wellingborough byelection, its best ever result. They believe it confirms national polling that suggests about one in 10 voters may back them. Yet despite the progress, many Reform supporters – and concerned Tory MPs – feel that the addition of Nigel Farage could turn the party from a minor irritant to the Conservatives into an existential threat. “I would hope he would come back,” said Stephen O’Neill, who had travelled with his wife, Sandra, from Glasgow. “I don’t think he’d be leader, but obviously Farage has got the ­charisma and the notoriety.” Sandra adds: “It needs publicity; that’s what they don’t get.”  Charlotte, from Gloucestershire, attracted to Reform because of a ­dislike of the main parties, was also keen for a Farage return. “I’d ­certainly like to see him,” she said. “He’s good at his job and getting the crowds together. He can give all the other leaders a good run for their money.” Even among attendees at the conference, however, there was an acknowledgment that the addition of Farage could be double-edged.  “He’s a polarising character, but that’s because the media portray him as that,” said Colin, an ex-Tory voter from Lincolnshire who said his former party doesn’t represent his views any longer. “I would like him to come back and help Reform, but not necessarily stand as a candidate. The mainstream media would circle like vultures to destroy him.” The policy platform announced in Doncaster is huge, from ending inheritance tax to replenishing the fishing fleet. Yet Tories on the right, sympathetic to many of the ideas, believe Farage is vital if Reform’s insurgency is to be significant.  “He’s the only one with any political nous,” said one former minister. He pointed to issues that seem too technical and remote, such as Northern Ireland’s Brexit mechanisms or the interest on quantitative easing reserves given to commercial banks. Exclusive polling for the Observer by Opinium sheds more light on the Farage factor. Reform UK has 10% support, the level it has recorded for some time, and similar to the share of votes in the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections that its leaders hailed as a breakthrough. The ­poll also suggests the return of Farage would make the party a bigger draw, even if the first past the post system means seizing a seat looks unlikely. Tice has a net approval rating of -9, not bad in comparison with other leaders, but most voters do not have an opinion at all and he is still largely unknown outside his party. Farage is on -19% among voters as a whole, but most have a view of him. Among Tory voters still backing the party, 39% approve of Farage, suggesting Reform could do serious damage to Rishi Sunak should Farage take the helm. Of current Tory voters, 42% said Farage’s return would make them more favourable towards Reform. It all leaves Farage with a dilemma. Should he once again return to fight a general election, which has seen him disappointed so many times before? Or should he, as he didrecently, spend his time on the money-­spinning media circuit in the US, commentating on his old ally Donald Trump’s campaign for the White House? The latter option also leaves open the bigger prize of joining a Tory party in search of leadership should it suffer a heavy general election loss. Farage remains tight-lipped. The other issue for Reform is that there is also a split among those on the right who believe the Tory party is headed in the wrong direction. While some have opted for a fresh start with Reform, others want to stay within the Tory tent and pull it further right. This is the tactic being pursued by several MPs and former Tory donors. To this group, Reform’s ­increasing support is the evidence they need to push Sunak in their direction. “I hear from constituents that they want the Conservative government to be more Conservative,” said one senior figure on the right. “They resent the drift in society. It’s a kind of modernism that they don’t like. They don’t like some of the characteristics of modern Britain, the atomisation of Britain and decline of traditional structures. That’s what they hate most and they think the government should do something about it. The Tory party just needs to be more Tory. Stop parroting the liberal left bollocks.” Sunak’s team claim to be relaxed about Reform’s recent performances, even though it was achieved ­without Farage. “The one thing that ­surprised us in Wellingborough was that Reform didn’t do as well as we thought they might,” said one source. “I remember when you got Ukip getting 60% in Clacton in 2014. And it’s very clear now that a vote for Reform is essentially a vote for Keir Starmer, so those votes could come back to us [at a general election].” As for the increasingly miserable liberal wing of the Tory party, they believe there is a confected element to the concerns expressed about the Reform threat. “These are not ­people panicking,” said one former cabinet minister. “These are people who want to turn the Tory party into Reform or some version of it, and are seizing on opportunities to do so. Anyone sensible recognises that you cannot simply add the Reform vote to the Tory vote and say, ‘look, it’s a new coalition’. You shed voters on the other side. “People who say that this is evidence to show we should leave the European convention on human rights and start campaigning on that are being, I think the parliamentary word is, disingenuous.”"

        "content": "Sadiq Khan has accused Lee Anderson of “pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred” after the former Tory deputy chair said Islamists had “got control” of London and its mayor.\nThe mayor of London said Anderson’s comments were Islamophobic and put across the notion that Muslims were “fair game” when it came to racism.\nHe also lambasted the prime minister for failing to condemn his own MP’s remarks, saying Rishi Sunak and his the cabinet were now complicit.\nKhan’s comments come after Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, said in a Friday night appearance on GB News that the mayor Khan had “given our capital away” to Islamists, referring to the latter as Khan’s “mates”.\nKhan responded on Saturday morning, telling Sky News: “These comments from a senior Conservative are Islamophobic, are anti-Muslim and are racist.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHe pointed to a recent surge in hate crimes, adding: “These comments pour fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred.\n“I am afraid the deafening silence form Rishi Sunak and from the cabinet is them condoning this racism.\n“I am afraid it confirms to many people across the country that there’s a hierarchy when it comes to racism.\n“I am unclear why Rishi Sunak, why members of his cabinet aren’t calling this out and aren’t condemning this.\n“It’s like they are complicit in this sort of racism. The message it sends is Muslims are fair game when it comes to racism and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“It’s not good enough in 2024 in the United Kingdom.”\nTory and Labour MPs have expressed their disgust at Anderson’s remarks, with the former chancellor Sajid Javid calling them “ridiculous”. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said they were “a total disgrace”.\nThe Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) had earlier called for Anderson to be kicked out of the parliamentary party.\nThe MCB said the comment was “disgusting” and criticised the “silence of the party in the face of such extremism”.\nA spokesperson added: “In a week where we learn of an explosion in Islamophobic hate crimes, influential MPs and a donor to the Conservative party are endorsing common talking points that peddle conspiracy theories and Islamophobic tropes of alleged Muslim takeovers of our country.”\nLabour’s chair, Anneliese Dodds, later wrote to her Conservative counterpart, Ric Holden, calling on him to take “serious, concrete action” on Islamophobia in the Tory party.\nShe said Anderson’s comments were “the tip of iceberg”, and a continuation of a “deeply concerning pattern of Islamophobic comments tolerated and Islamophobia not dealt with”.\nShe added: “Lee Anderson’s comments were unambiguously Islamophobic and Rishi Sunak’s failure to suspend the whip or take any other action speaks volumes …\n“Sunak has a clear choice: show some backbone and withdraw the whip or be forever known as the Tory leader who was too weak to stop the far-right rhetoric in his own party.”\nThe letter states that, despite a review into Islamophobia in the Tory party in 2021, the party has failed to meaningfully tackle it.\nThe chorus of condemnation over Anderson continued on Saturday, with the business minister Nus Ghani describing her fellow Tory MP’s comments as “foolish and dangerous”.\nIn a post on X, she said: “I have spoken to Lee Anderson. I’ve called out Islamic extremism (& been attacked by hard left, far right & Islamists).\n“I don’t for one moment believe that Sadiq Khan is controlled by Islamists. To say so, is both foolish and dangerous. Frankly this is all so tiring ….”\nThe Conservative peer Gavin Barwell, who was Theresa May’s chief of staff in No 10, described the comment as a “despicable slur”.\nNeil Garratt, leader of the Conservatives at City Hall, said he had “no shortage of criticisms of Mayor Khan” but added “he is not an Islamist, he is not in the pockets of Islamists, and I completely disagree with anyone who says otherwise”.\nThe shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, called the comments “a total disgrace” and said they “whipped up hate at a time our country needs to come together”. He asked Sunak: “When will you act to remove the Conservative party whip?”\nThe former Conservative chancellor Sajid Javid was among those who criticised Anderson’s comments, calling it a “ridiculous thing to say”.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAsked on Saturday morning whether Anderson should lose the Tory whip, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said the matter was “one for the party itself”. He declined to say whether the MP for Ashfield was a good representative voice for the Tories, saying only that “we live in a democracy where people are allowed to speak their mind and Lee Anderson, I think, is famed for speaking his mind”.\nIt comes in a week in which former prime minister Liz Truss had used a talk at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in the US to claim her efforts to cut taxes were “sabotaged” by the “administrative state and the deep state”.\nThe former prime minister later took part in an interview with the former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and remained silent as he hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson a “hero”.\nJavid criticised her for not challenging the comment, saying: “I’d hope every MP would confront such a statement head on. Liz should really know better.”\nIn a letter to Sunak on Friday, the shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, said “egregious” remarks made by Truss and Anderson “cannot go unchecked or unchallenged”.\nThe Muslim Council of Britain welcomed Anderson’s suspension but said the Conservative party has “an Islamophobia problem” and his remarks are “only the tip of an iceberg”.\nA Conservative spokesperson said: “An investigation and subsequent independent review, both conducted over several years by Prof Swaran Singh, found no evidence of institutional racism in the Conservative party.” \nSpeaking before Khan’s comments, a Conservative party source said: “Lee was simply making the point that the mayor, in his capacity as PCC (police and crime commissioner) for London, has abjectly failed to get a grip on the appalling Islamist marches we have seen in London recently.”"

        "content": "Keir Starmer had assembled a leadership team about six months before the December 2019 general election that led to Jeremy Corbyn’s resignation as Labour leader. The team, codenamed the “Arlington Group”, began planning in earnest how Starmer could capture the leadership from June of that year – including a detailed breakdown of how Labour’s membership could be convinced to support him. The revelation is made in a new biography of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer: The Biography, by Tom Baldwin, a former journalist who served as one of Ed Miliband’s advisers during his time leading the party.   Related: Emotional, messy and breathtakingly ruthless: the hidden life of Keir Starmer   The group was formed as early as 2018 when Jenny Chapman, who was Darlington MP, asked him if he had ever thought about being the party’s leader. Starmer is said to have replied that it was something he “might want to do”. Meetings then began to take place on Monday mornings around the kitchen table at her home. Its codename was derived from the road in London where one of them lived. Those involved said that there was never a plan to topple Corbyn – the failed coup against him in 2016 had proved that it would be almost impossible to do so. Starmer is also said to have refused to acknowledge at that stage that he would be running. “Keir used to have this lawyerly phrase of: ‘I want to be in a position to consider standing – should a vacancy arise,’” said one of those involved. However, the preparations being made for a leadership attempt kicked into another gear in June 2019 with the arrival of an official that Starmer referred to as “the new guy”. It turned out to be Morgan McSweeney, now Labour’s influential campaigns director. Some were initially sceptical of McSweeney, who had also overseen Liz Kendall’s ill-fated leadership challenge in 2015, when she won less than 5% of the vote. However, he presented detailed research into the Labour membership – who would largely decide the identity of the party’s next leader – and how a winning coalition could be formed. “He got out his slide deck,” recalled Chris Ward, a former Starmer aide. “He ran through exactly where the membership was on every question, which bits of it we could get, which bits we couldn’t. It was brilliant. Afterwards, when we’re walking back, Keir had this little grin on his face, and was like: ‘D’you see what I mean now?’” The revelations are most likely to anger the Labour left and supporters of Corbyn, who were often suspicious of Starmer and his team before the 2019 election. But allies of the Labour leader said that Starmer had never plotted against Corbyn. They said he had simply been preparing the ground for what he regarded as an inevitable leadership race should Labour lose the election. The news comes after a previous revelation from the book that Starmer considered resigning in the wake of the 2021 defeat in the Hartlepool byelection, a seat that the party had held since its creation. It was lost as so-called “red wall” seats continued to fall to the Tories under Boris Johnson’s leadership. The byelection marked the most serious threat to Starmer’s leadership to date and came before a series of Tory implosions that have since helped Labour win a string of byelections and open a double-digit poll lead. Starmer was apparently persuaded to stay in post by aides and his wife, Victoria. Ward said: “Keir kept saying that he felt he would have to go, that the result showed the party was going backwards, and he saw it as a personal rejection. I told him it was far too soon for that kind of thing, but it was a rocky few hours.”"

        "content": "The government has been accused of a cover-up for refusing to publish a review of the so-called golden visa scheme that allowed wealthy investors, including at least 10 sanctioned Russian oligarchs, to take up residency in the UK. The Tier 1 visa scheme, whereby super-rich individuals could buy the right to live in the UK by investing in British-registered companies, was closed in February 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amid concerns that the system was being abused. But the government has repeatedly refused to publish a review of the visa scheme that was launched in 2018, in the wake of the nerve agent attack targeting former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. “[It is] highly inappropriate and scandalous for the government to block this vital information,” said campaigner Bill Browder, a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, after the Home Office rejected a Freedom of Information request for the golden visa report filed by the investigative Substack account Democracy for Sale.  “This is no longer a political issue but a matter of national security. These visas should be withdrawn immediately.” Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran has written to home secretary James Cleverly calling for the review to be published immediately. “Frankly, the whole thing stinks of a cover-up. We know Putin’s cronies used and abused this scheme – so why won’t the government give us the full picture? On the two-year anniversary of Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and following the death of Alexei Navalny at the hands of Putin, I am again asking the government to publish the findings of the review, where they relate to economic crime, in full.” she said. The government issued a summary of the findings of the golden visa investigation last January but refused to release the review. In a written statement to parliament, then home secretary Suella Braverman said that the golden visa route had attracted a disproportionate number of applicants from countries identified by the government as at risk of money-laundering and terrorist funding. Braverman said that the review found that a minority of golden visa investors were “potentially at high risk” of having links to corruption or organised crime, including 10 Russians sanctioned following the Ukraine invasion. Residency through investment was introduced in 1994. The scheme was rebranded Tier 1 (Investor) Visa in 2008, under a new points-based immigration system to attract investors in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2011, the Conservative-led government pledged to “roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs and investors”, by giving those who invested larger sums of money permanent residency faster, and significantly relaxing residency requirements. Under the scheme, foreign nationals who invested £2m could be granted a visa, with more benefits the higher the investment and a “steady path” to achieving “much-prized UK citizenship”. Between 2008 and 2015, there were minimal checks on the source of wealth. Applicants did not need a UK bank account and there were no specific money laundering checks.Some 85% of all golden visas given to individuals from Russia were handed out during this “blind faith” period. The parliamentary intelligence and security committee’s “Russia report” – eventually published in 2020 – warned that “the exploitation of the UK’s investor visa scheme” was “the key to London’s appeal” for Russian oligarchs and their money. In all more than 2,500 Russians held investor visas, including former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and the former wife of Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia’s richest men. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption, said: “Golden visas were a shocking loophole for dirty money to make its way into our economy, and for oligarchs to buy their way into this country. We need full transparency on who benefited from it and what went wrong. The government should have nothing to hide.” The Home Office said that it had published key findings from the golden visa review and would not comment further “to protect operational sensitivities in the law enforcement process”."

        "content": "Every day at 10am George Galloway rallies his troops at a Suzuki showroom just outside Rochdale town centre. In one room, boxes of leaflets are piled high against second-hand cars. In another, he takes his campaign to the airwaves. Earlier this week when MPs raised fears for their safety amid the increasingly fraught votes on Gaza, Galloway told thousands of supporters online that the names of Keir Starmer’s team were “dripping in blood”. From the Suzuki boardroom where, according to activists, he broadcasts his twice-weekly online polemics, he said Labour’s motion had been proposed by “the Labour fiends of Israel, not friends” and “the worst scoundrels and criminals in the international community at this time”. With less than a week to go until the vote described as “the most radioactive byelection in living memory”, Galloway, the veteran agitator, is the bookies’ favourite to win. “I stand on the brink of an historic byelection victory which will shake the walls of Westminster, which will change history,” he bellowed with characteristic understatement this week. Galloway, 69, has twice unseated Labour, his former party, in similarly ugly elections, and plans to ride another wave of anger from Rochdale to the Commons on 29 February. The former Press TV host refused to talk to the Guardian at his election HQ this week, but the mood among his activists was upbeat. About 30% of Rochdale’s population is Muslim – around 30,000 people – and they feel they have enough support to overturn Labour’s 9,668-vote majority.  Interactive  In some parts of Rochdale, every house has a Galloway poster in the window. WhatsApp groups are abuzz. His leaflets, in the colours of the Palestinian flag, mention “potholes”, “town centre” and “grooming gangs”, but online the maverick politician is clear that the poll is about one issue: “a referendum on Gaza”. Going into the final weekend of campaigning, the mood among Labour figures was dark. The party in effect left the playing field after it emerged that its candidate, Azhar Ali, had been recorded sharing inflammatory conspiracy theories about Israeli involvement in the 7 October atrocity. Labour was already haemorrhaging support from the town’s Muslim community before the scandal, amid unease about the party’s stance on a ceasefire and Starmer’s suggestion in an LBC interview that Israel had the “right” to cut off Gaza’s water, a comment he later clarified. One senior party figure said Labour had planned to “counter Galloway’s megaphone with a whisper campaign”, soothing community concerns in quiet conversations in homes, mosques and community centres. But that plan was killed when Ali, who had been tasked with bringing people back to the party, was suspended. The only hope now is that there is enough residual support for Labour to survive, but there is little optimism. “If we could cling on to half that vote I think we’d have survived,” said one local Labour source on Friday. “I’m not so sure we will now.” Galloway is the bookies’ favourite. His team has about 200 volunteers – including a core of 50 – who plan to make contact with each of Rochdale’s 79,000 voters three times before polling day. One of the volunteers, Farrukh Haroon, 48, the brother of the former Respect party leader Salma Yaqoob, said they had activists at the school gates – some handing out stickers in the colours of the Palestine flag – and others spreading the word on social media. “There will be a massive, massive push this weekend,” he said, stuffing leaflets though letterboxes. It is online where Labour fears Galloway is having the most impact. Harrowing images emerge daily out of Gaza and are shared widely on the WhatsApp groups of younger Muslims in Rochdale, many who do not have their parents’ loyalty to Labour. In Rochdale town centre, there was little enthusiasm for any of the 11 male candidates. Ann Beresford, 70, said she had always voted Labour but was dismayed by Ali’s remarks and the party’s handling of it. “If he’s making comments like that he should keep it to himself,” she said. Her daughter Sarah Taafe, 47, said she also normally voted Labour but had decided not to cast a vote next week with a general election due some time in the next year. In the San Remo cafe, another former Labour MP has returned to haunt the party. Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale from 2010 to 2017, was suspended by the party in 2015 over explicit messages he sent to a 17-year-old girl. Now he is back and standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party presided over by Nigel Farage. Tucking into a small caesar salad – his wife, a 29-year-old beauty therapist from Rwanda, has banned him from eating carbohydrates before polling day – Danczuk, 57, said he believed Galloway would not be Rochdale’s next MP as there was a “silent majority who are determined not to have him”. Whatever the result, there is little sign that Rochdale will be able to unite behind the winner. The loser, said one businesswoman, would be Rochdale: “It’s a total, total disaster. Everything you hear about Rochdale is negative and it’s not a negative place at all. Most people are saying: isn’t it chaotic. End of story.”"

Anneliese Dodds, the Labour chair, said: “Lee Anderson’s comments are unambiguously racist and Islamophobic. Rishi Sunak needs to immediately remove the whip. If he is too weak, then people will take their own view of the modern Conservative party.”\nTan Dhesi, the shadow exports minister, said: “Given the recent spike in Islamophobia and antisemitism, and the febrile atmosphere in our country, it’s deplorable that an elected MP can openly make such incendiary and divisive statements; especially against Sadiq Khan, who has done so much to foster community cohesion and tackle hate crime.”\nA Conservative source said: “Lee was simply making the point that the mayor, in his capacity as [police and crime commissioner] for London, has abjectly failed to get a grip on the appalling Islamist marches we have seen in London recently.”\nA report published this week suggested that anti-Muslim hate in the UK has more than tripled in the four months since Hamas’s attacks. Tell Mama, a charity, recorded 2,010 Islamophobic incidents between 7 October and 7 February, compared with 600 in the same period last year.\nRob Blackie, the Liberal Democrats’ mayoral candidate in London, accused Anderson of “spreading dangerous conspiracy theories” and called for him to lose the Tory whip.\nThe Conservative party was contacted and asked whether it planned to take any action against Anderson.\nAnderson is the Tory MP for Ashfield and was a deputy chair of the Conservative party until mid-January, when he resigned over the vote on the government’s Rwanda deportation policy.\nIn the same GB News appearance on Friday, Anderson suggested politicians should intervene in police operations because they had not cracked down on pro-Palestinian protesters.\n“Ultimately we run the country, and if the police aren’t doing their job – and they’re not doing their job … we need to step in and take over,” Anderson said."

        "content": "There has been a lot of hot air following the ruling by Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons (Lindsay Hoyle fights back as Sunak criticises speaker’s ‘concerning’ choice, 22 February). Conservatives and the Scottish National party in particular should reflect that they may well benefit from any move away from the hitherto rigid approach towards amendments to motions. The speaker was right to stress the importance of allowing a range of views on difficult and important issues. I well remember in the debate over war in Iraq not wanting to vote for either the government’s motion or the only amendment that had been allowed, and preferring a third that had not been selected. Joyce QuinLabour, House of Lords • “Everyone wanted a ceasefire. Only they wanted their own ceasefire, not anyone else’s ceasefire.” John Crace is spot-on in his parliamentary sketch (While people die in Gaza, the UK parliament goes to war over the ceasefire, 21 February). A day wasted and Westminster politics revealed for what it is. A tawdry farce whose outcome – even if “precedent” had been followed – would make no difference to the suffering in Gaza. And all this while we continue to send arms to Israel. Shameful.Lyn A DadeTwickenham, London • Thank you to John Crace for summarising what I felt. His white-hot fury regarding the ridiculous shenanigans in parliament over the Gaza conflict was powerful writing that cut through to my soul.Helen BeioleyFrance Lynch, Gloucestershire • Clearly the Conservatives and the SNP were more interested in using convention to present Labour with a Hobson’s choice rather than engaging with the substantive issue. The speaker had reasons for moving away from convention. He should have stuck to his guns rather than apologise. He might also dump other conventions and allow polite clapping to signify approval as is the norm in civilised society, and insist on prime ministers answering the questions rather than rabbiting out unrelated set pieces.Robert DysonKenilworth, Warwickshire • Should Russia invade Poland, I assume there will be a debate in the House of Commons. Let’s imagine that the Liberal Democrats use an opposition day motion to propose a policy of pacifism, and the Conservatives counter with a plan to nuke Moscow. It would be absurd if other policies were not then considered. The conventions of the House of Commons are as outdated as Jacob Rees-Mogg’s double-breasted suit.Mark GoodingLondon • Your report (Commons speaker apologises after Gaza ceasefire debate descends into chaos, 21 February) reminded me that I’ve been thinking of setting my next novel in an undistinguished country in which, in the course of a single day, the machinations of just one essentially powerless individual disrupt its governance so comprehensively that it is in effect without leadership while, simultaneously, its nuclear defence capabilities prove themselves to be inoperative. Do you think the idea stretches credulity too far?Bill KirtonAberdeen • As a socialist, I always think people can change for the better, so I agree that while Lindsay Hoyle made a mistake in taking a decision that prevented an SNP motion calling for an immediate unconditional ceasefire in Gaza to be debated and voted on, he can make amends by allowing this now to happen (Editorial, 22 February). What is less excusable is his effort to somehow link entirely peaceful protests for Palestine with a terrorist threat to MPs. There is no factual basis to that point and he needs to apologise for making it.Keith FlettTottenham, London • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "The politician Bob Stewart has had his conviction for a racially aggravated public order offence quashed. The MP for Beckenham, who surrendered the Conservative whip last November while he appealed, had his conviction overturned at Southwark crown court on Friday. Stewart, 74, was convicted in November after telling an activist to “go back to Bahrain” during an argument outside the Foreign Office’s Lancaster House in December 2022. He had been attending an event hosted by the Bahraini embassy when the protester, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, shouted: “Bob Stewart, for how much did you sell yourself to the Bahraini regime?” During a heated exchange, Stewart replied: “Go away, I hate you. You make a lot of fuss. Go back to Bahrain.” He also told Alwadaei to “get stuffed, Bahrain’s a great place, end of”. Alwadaei told the court he felt “dehumanised” after Stewart told him to “go back to Bahrain”. But the judge found that while Stewart’s comments towards Alwadaei had amounted to abuse, they did not cause alarm or distress. Making the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Joel Bennathan said: “The fact that even after Mr Stewart’s abusive comments, Mr Alwadaei continued to address him in similar terms and at a similar pitch would scarcely suggest to an observer that he was caused any upset, alarm or distress.” He acknowledged that Alwadaei felt that the comments were racist, but said: “The feelings of the person against which the abusive comments are directed are not determinative but not irrelevant.” Earlier, Lady Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the first female lord justice of appeal, gave a character reference for Stewart in court. She said: “He’s very kind, very generous. He has a somewhat flippanty, offhand manner, which sometimes people find rather difficult, but I actually find quite funny. I’ve never heard him be unkind to anyone. I’ve never heard him be racist.” The court heard that Alwadaei came to the UK from Bahrain as a refugee after he was tortured for attending a protest against the regime. Alwadaei said he wanted to question Stewart about his support for Bahrain. “Those that would affiliate themselves with a regime that is so corrupt, they should be questioned for their affiliation,” he said. Stewart is a former British army officer who was stationed in Bahrain in 1969 and has described himself as a “friend” of the Middle Eastern country. He denied that his comments were racist, and claimed he meant Alwadaei could protest safely if he were to return to Bahrain. “[I said] go back to Bahrain because I know it to be a very decent place and I thought you would get a decent hearing there,” he told the court. He said he was “upset” by Alwadaei’s remarks because they made him feel “that I was a corrupt man and that I had accepted money from Bahrain … I had not. I was upset by this.” He added that when he said “I hate you” he meant “I hate what you are saying”."

        "content": "Reform UK will seek to capitalise on its momentum in the polls and third-place finishes in two recent byelections by launching new policies and new candidates at a rally in Doncaster on Saturday. After the havoc wreaked on Ukip and the Brexit party by candidates who had to be suspended over racist and offensive comments, a vetting team at the rightwing populist party is trawling through would-be MPs’ past social media output. This week Reform fired its Henley and Thame candidate after he compared transgender and non-binary people to Hitler and called Gay Pride a “sin” in online posts. But allegations the party is a haven for conspiracy theorists and extremists persist as it aims to try to maintain electoral momentum, polling 13% in a YouGov voting intention survey on Thursday.  An analysis by the Guardian of Reform UK’s already selected candidates also indicates that work is being done to scrub online pages of those who have made controversial comments, while many remain on the party’s website. They include Tony Glover, the candidate for Poplar and Limehouse, who falsely states in a profile that the Labour MP Apsana Begum “has aligned herself with extremist causes like Hamas”.  Begum said: “Such false and defamatory allegations are not only Islamophobic but further add to the situation I am facing with regard to increasing far-right threats to my safety – including death threats.   Related: Who’s steering the Conservatives to the right? The backseat drivers of Reform UK | John Harris   “The rise in Islamophobia in the UK is alarming. I will always stand up for my constituents – multiracial, multicultural and of all faiths and none – against such toxicity.” Alongside veterans from the party’s previous Brexit-era predecessors, Reform’s candidates also include those railing against “globalists”, a term regarded elsewhere as an antisemitic trope. Jewish groups have condemned Nigel Farage for using the term although Reform UK sources said they “reject the idea that being uncomfortable with the Davos agenda is in any way antisemitic”. Other Reform UK candidates on the party’s website warn about the “great reset” – an abstract term that emerged out of the World Economic Forum but which has taken on a life of its own among conspiracy theorists. In other cases, there have been deletions of candidate profiles on the party website, including one who had described climate breakdown as “benign”. A separate candidate, Robert Hall-Palmer in Newark, echoed the Reform UK leadership’s hostility to net zero, which he described as “a dangerous false ideology that can only bring harm”. But in an earlier version of his profile he said the role of human activity in the climate crisis was “overplayed”, falsely claimed the United Arab Emirates questioned the science of climate change at Cop28, and backed something he called “Russia’s theory on hydrocarbons”. Reform’s leader, Richard Tice, sacked the Henley and Thame candidate this week and said on GB News that candidates were being strictly vetted: “They’ve all been told, don’t do this stuff. And if you do, you’re going to be fired. It’s as simple as that.” The rally in Doncaster comes days before Thursday’s byelection in Rochdale, where the party is hoping its candidate – the former Labour MP Simon Danczuk – will make a strong showing amid Labour turmoil. Reform’s honorary president, Farage, had by midday on Friday yet to be announced among the speakers. Days earlier, he had appeared alongside the former Tory leader Liz Truss at a rightwing conference in the US, encouraging speculation that he could ultimately rejoin the Conservative party. Fresh research released on Friday by the More in Common thinktank underlined how it is Farage, and not Tice, who is attracting voters to Reform. The polling also showed that, unlike other voter cohorts, the single issue of immigration was why people supported Reform. For six-in-10 Reform UK voters, its policies on immigration were a top reason for voting for that party. A quarter of Reform UK voters back the party out of support for Farage – while just 7% are doing so to support Tice. In contrast to Reform’s policies on lockdown and climate change, the polling also revealed these priorities were firmly at the bottom of a list of reasons for voting Reform and many were pro-vaccine. A fifth of its voters also felt that tackling the climate crisis should be a top priority for the next government. Nevertheless, the party remained a threat to the Conservatives and More in Common’s UK director, Luke Tryl, said its decent polling performance had overwhelmingly come from disillusioned 2019 Conservative voters. “But Reform standing down at the general election in some sort of deal like the one the Brexit party did with Boris Johnson would only benefit the Conservatives by a small amount. If Reform was not an option, only a quarter would go back to the Conservatives,” he said."

        "content": "MPs have spoken about the lengths they are going to to keep safe amid heightened tensions over the war in the Middle East.\nSome Labour MPs who have been vocal on Israel and Palestine said they were fearful there could be a violent attack on a politician.\nWhile the vast majority of people make their views on the conflict known peacefully, MPs and staff said the politically charged atmosphere had brought an increase in abuse and threats.\nTan Dhesi, the Labour MP for Slough, said he felt his life was at risk. He has been subject to death threats and faced protests at his office and constituency surgeries since October. He said Thames Valley police had located the individual behind one death threat and charged them.\n“Everyone has a legitimate right to protest, but it’s the vitriol and the abuse and death threats which are completely unacceptable,” Dhesi said. “Some people are looking to blame somebody – their MP, councillor, anyone.”\nLike other MPs, Dhesi has had to take extra security measures since October, and now has a police presence at his constituency surgeries. “This will deter a lot of good people from entering politics simply because they know they have to basically get accustomed to a lot of abuse,” he said.\nHe added that disinformation was making the problem worse. “I fear that someone sooner or later will be very seriously injured, if not killed, based on what people are perceiving to be the truth.”\n\n Related: Why is the Commons speaker facing calls to quit and what happens next? \n\nMargaret Hodge, the Labour MP for Barking who once faced down a challenge in her constituency from the then British National party leader Nick Griffin in 2010, said that since October she had taken extra security precautions, including wearing a panic alarm.\n“I’m more careful about changing my route walking to the tube station or if I’m coming home,” she said. “I look more carefully around me.”\nShe recalled resolving to go to John Lewis to buy a reading light before realising it was the Saturday of the first big pro-Palestinian march in London. “I just thought, ‘This is crazy Margaret – there will be loads of people in central London’. I didn’t do it,” she said. It was the same day that Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, was mobbed by pro-Palestinian protesters as he walked through Victoria station.\nHodge said she had seen an increase in threats and abuse, of which her staff bear the brunt. “Anything we think is awful, we go to the police. Some of my Muslim colleagues have been having a much harder time than I have.”\nA Muslim Labour MP who asked to be kept anonymous said they had received a “very serious death threat” before Christmas for being vocally pro-Palestine.\n“I live with my young children in my constituency and I hid it from them,” they said. “It’s an incredibly lonely place to be when you are worried about your family but can’t share it with them.”\nSeveral MPs argued on Friday that fears of intimidation and abuse should not be used to shut down legitimate protest, nor should pro-Palestine protesters be depicted as a mob.\nDiane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said on X: “I get more abuse and threats than most MPs. But the suggestion that police could close down peaceful demonstrations outside MPs’ offices, town halls and parliament is appalling.”\nJess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said on the social media platform: “Level of Islamophobia people are displaying currently is sickening. My constituents, family and friends are not Islamists, they do not hate any of these things. They are not a mob, they are just people. No one bullied me (any more than on any issue).”\nLindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, sparked a debate on the intimidation of MPs this week when he broke parliamentary protocol to allow three separate votes on a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAn emotional Hoyle told MPs he had taken his decision, which allowed Labour to dodge a difficult vote and sent the Commons into uproar, because he was fearful of an attack on MPs. “I don’t ever want to go through the situation of picking up a phone to find that a friend, of whatever side, has been murdered by terrorists. I also don’t want another attack on this house,” he said.\nParliamentary staff said Hoyle’s decision had them “in the middle of a storm” and placed them at increased risk.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOne parliamentary worker said her colleagues had received messages since the ceasefire votes accusing them of being “complicit in genocide”. Another had received voicemail messages saying they had “blood on their hands”.\nA staff member for an MP said it was “only a matter of time” until “the worst happens”. They said abuse had become normalised and that MPs had a platform to speak out about it, but staff do not have the same ability.\nA fourth parliamentary worker said Hoyle had created more risk for staff because of the perception that the Commons was undermining debate about Gaza. “Instead our safety is being used to defend decisions to undermine these debates, which then makes us a greater target,” they said."

        "content": "  2.24pm GMT  Closing summary   It is “nonsense” for protesters outside MPs’ homes to claim they are not seeking to intimidate, James Cleverly has said. “Someone saying: ‘I’m standing outside someone’s private house in numbers, but we don’t seek to intimidate’, I’m sorry, that’s clearly nonsense,” the home secretary told the BBC’s Today programme. “Where a mob of people are outside someone’s private residence, clearly with the intention of distorting their future votes, that is unacceptable and we expect the police to deal with it.” Shamima Begum, who left Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State, has lost an appeal against the decision to remove her British citizenship. Begum travelled to Syria in 2015 at the age of 15. Her citizenship was revoked on national security grounds shortly after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019. Downing Street has briefed that it was “wrong” for a controversial pro-Palestinian message to be projected onto Parliament but stopped short of saying police should have intervened, PA reports. The phrase “from the river to the sea” was reportedly beamed onto the building on Wednesday as Gaza protesters descended on Westminster. Rishi Sunak has hit out at the behaviour of protesters who he says are threatening MPs, after warnings that politicians’ safety was put at risk during this week’s chaotic parliamentary debate on Gaza. The prime minister said on Friday it was “unacceptable” for MPs to feel intimidated in their jobs, amid an ongoing row over whether the Commons speaker was right to bend parliamentary rules this week in an effort to protect MPs’ safety. The Scottish government has announced it will provide £24.5 million to secure the investment of a Japanese firm in a Highland cable factory, PA reports. Scotland’s Wellbeing Economy Secretary, Mairi McAllan, has used her first speech in the brief to confirm the funding at an event in Edinburgh. EU sources are playing down the significance of the new deal between the bloc’s border agency Frontex and the UK. Insiders in Brussels say the UK as an important partner of a global alliance to counter migrant smuggling. However the new arrangement with the UK is one that Frontex has with 18 different partners around the world helping to identify trends and patterns including organised crime and people smuggling.      2.18pm GMT   Rishi Sunak has offered his support for protesting farmers in Wales. Taking questions after a speech at the Welsh Conservative conference in Llandudno on Friday, the prime minister said: “You can just really tell the visceral anger amongst the farming community here in Wales about what has been done to them. “That anger is palpable, and they have every right to be angry. “By the Welsh government’s own assessment, their ideas are going to lead to thousands of job losses, reduce our food production and food security and destroy farm incomes. “It just demonstrates again why their plans are the wrong ones, and the wrong ones particularly for rural Wales. “There are farmers outside here today and they are expressing that anger and we will do everything we can, and you guys are doing a great job of highlighting that this is the reality of a Labour in power.”     1.44pm GMT   MPs are reminiscing about football chats in a very empty chamber as they debate the second reading of a bill to create a specific offence of unauthorised entry to football matches. Home Office minister, Tom Tugendhat, admitted to having been tongue tied at Henry Kissinger’s funeral earlier this year as the latest season in London’s football was discussed. “I have to confess I found myself slightly wanting for words but it was an environment in which there were many others to supply them so I was delighted to stay silent as the progress of the various football teams were discussed,” he said.  The reason for all the football anecdotes was a private members’ bill introduced by Labour’s Kevin Brannon, to create an offence of unauthorised entry at football matches that could result in a football banning order. Brannon said the measures were needed after an independent review found that the mass entry of those without tickets to the Men’s Euros final at Wembley could have resulted in fatalities. Brannon said: “The mere though that such a catastrophe is still possible in this century at a football match in the 21st century, after the tragedies of the latter part of the last century is a profoundly unsettling thought.”      1.04pm GMT   The Scottish government has announced it will provide £24.5 million to secure the investment of a Japanese firm in a Highland cable factory, PA reports. Scotland’s Wellbeing Economy Secretary, Mairi McAllan, has used her first speech in the brief to confirm the funding at an event in Edinburgh.  The power cable factory at the Port of Nigg in Easter Ross was billed by First Minister, Humza Yousaf, as part of “Scotland’s green revolution”.  The Highland factory, which could create 330 jobs and plough £350m into the economy, will be run by the Japanese company Sumitomo. Yousaf said the plans were “great news” for the Scottish economy.     12.37pm GMT   Downing Street has briefed that it was “wrong” for a controversial pro-Palestinian message to be projected onto Parliament but stopped short of saying police should have intervened, PA reports. The phrase “from the river to the sea” was reportedly beamed onto the building on Wednesday as Gaza protesters descended on Westminster. A No 10 spokeswoman told journalists: “It is rightly a decision for the independent police to make operational decisions on the ground. “But at the same time, I think most people would agree, irrespective of operational decisions which are rightly for the police, that that that was wrong. And we are extremely mindful and would continue to urge people to be mindful of the fear and distress felt by people and many communities around the country.” She added: “We’re very clear that harassment, abuse, intimidation is unacceptable”  Updated at 12.37pm GMT    12.30pm GMT   Downing Street welcomed a Court of Appeal decision to dismiss Shamima Begum’s challenge over the removal of her British citizenship. “We welcome the decision,” a No 10 spokeswoman told reporters on Friday. “I wouldn’t comment on the details of individual cases. “We’re pleased the court has found in favour of the Government. “Beyond that I would just say that our priority remains on maintaining the safety and security of the UK. “We’ll always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and we never take decisions around deprivation (of citizenship) lightly.”     12.14pm GMT  Shamima Begum loses appeal against removal of British citizenship  Shamima Begum, who left Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State, has lost an appeal against the decision to remove her British citizenship. Begum travelled to Syria in 2015 at the age of 15. Her citizenship was revoked on national security grounds shortly after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019. Last year, the now 24-year-old lost a challenge against the decision at the special immigration appeals commission. Begum’s lawyers brought a bid to overturn this decision at the court of appeal, with the Home Office opposing the challenge. All three appeal judges ruled against her on Friday. Dame Sue Carr, the head of the court of appeal, said the judges unanimously dismissed Begum’s appeal: “It could be argued that the decision in Miss Begum’s case was harsh. “It could also be argued that Miss Begum is the author of her own misfortune. But it is not for this court to agree or disagree with either point of view. “Our only task is to assess whether the deprivation decision was unlawful. We have concluded it was not and the appeal is dismissed.”   Related: Shamima Begum loses appeal against removal of British citizenship       12.02pm GMT   EU sources are playing down the significance of the new deal between the bloc’s border agency Frontex and the UK.  Insiders in Brussels say the UK as an important partner of a global alliance to counter migrant smuggling. However the new arrangement with the UK is one that Frontex has with 18 different partners around the world helping to identify trends and patterns including organised crime and people smuggling.  The deal does not repair the rupture in the relationship with EU security authorities caused by Brexit.  However it will give the UK an “early warning system” on migration trends through access to data from Eurosur, the EU surveillance system involving drones and other tools.  It means, for example, if there is a surge in irregular migration in the Mediterranean, the UK will be able to plan appropriately for a potential surge in cross-channel people smuggling as experience has shown there is usually a connection between the two, said a British source.      11.46am GMT  Protesters outside MPs' homes 'unacceptable', says home secretary  It is “nonsense” for protesters outside MPs’ homes to claim they are not seeking to intimidate, James Cleverly has said. “Someone saying: ‘I’m standing outside someone’s private house in numbers, but we don’t seek to intimidate’, I’m sorry, that’s clearly nonsense,” the home secretary told the BBC’s Today programme. “Where a mob of people are outside someone’s private residence, clearly with the intention of distorting their future votes, that is unacceptable and we expect the police to deal with it.” He said police already have the powers that they need to stop protests outside MPs’ homes and offices, “and we also want them to understand that they have our backing when they use those powers”. “The only thing that politicians should fear is the ballot box,” Cleverly said. “It’s incredibly important... that we do not allow a situation to be created where people cannot vote with their belief and conscience because of fear of reprisals. “The ballot box is where people and organisations should make their views clear.”  Updated at 11.59am GMT    11.25am GMT   Rishi Sunak has claimed the public are “feeling that the economy has turned the corner” and “things are getting better”. Taking questions after a speech at the Welsh Conservative conference in Llandudno on Friday, the prime minister said:   There is a palpable sense out there, regardless of what Keir Starmer might want to say because he’s always keen to talk down Britain, I can tell actually on the ground people are, since the beginning of this year, feeling that the economy has turned the corner. They do see those green shoots. They can see that things are getting better. Inflation has been more than halved, mortgage rates starting to come down, wages have been rising for six, seven months in a row now. We just saw today ... energy bills significantly down. Consumer confidence, business confidence, again, survey out yesterday, highest it’s been in years. Businesses like yours feeling better about the future. And that is why it is so important that we stick to our plan.      11.08am GMT  Sunak decries ‘intimidation’ by protesters amid row over chaotic Gaza vote  Rishi Sunak has hit out at the behaviour of protesters who he says are threatening MPs, after warnings that politicians’ safety was put at risk during this week’s chaotic parliamentary debate on Gaza. The prime minister said on Friday it was “unacceptable” for MPs to feel intimidated in their jobs, amid an ongoing row over whether the Commons speaker was right to bend parliamentary rules this week in an effort to protect MPs’ safety. Sunak told reporters during a tour of north Wales: “It’s simply unacceptable for intimidation or aggressive behaviour to threaten our parliamentary democracy and our freedom of expression. “Some of the scenes we’ve been seeing in recent months, particularly antisemitic behaviour, are appalling and unacceptable.”   Related: Sunak decries ‘intimidation’ by protesters amid row over chaotic Gaza vote       10.37am GMT   Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has urged a potential incoming Labour government to make him ambassador to the US in the “national interest”. He says he is “half-joking” but also said he would be “ideal” for the role in a future Keir Starmer government. He told The Sun:  Labour must think very, very hard in the national interest about what they are going to do with an incoming Trump administration. And right at the moment, I think they are ignoring it. You’ve got to have someone who can actually walk into the Oval Office and talk face to face with an incoming President Trump. So, half jokingly I could say me, but I can’t see them ever appointing me. But, I would be ideal for it. I would be, I am being serious, I would be. But they need to think very hard.      10.19am GMT   It is “unacceptable” for intimidation to threaten democracy, Rishi Sunak has said. Speaking during a tour of North Wales on Friday, the prime minister was asked about protests outside MPs’ homes. He told reporters:   I think MPs’ safety is incredibly important. And it’s right that in our society, democracy needs to be able to function smoothly. People need to be able to raise their views and debate things without the fear of being intimidated or indeed attacked. And that’s why we’re giving police more powers to clamp down on protests. It’s simply unacceptable for intimidation or aggressive behaviour to threaten our parliamentary democracy and our freedom of expression. And some of the scenes we’ve been seeing in recent months, particularly antisemitic behaviour, are appalling and unacceptable. That’s why we’re giving the police more powers and I expect them to use them to make sure we clamp down on all of this.      10.05am GMT   The government will not be “distracted or deterred” from providing compensation to sub-postmasters wronged in the Horizon scandal, James Cleverly has said. The home secretary was asked about a letter from the Post Office chief executive Nick Read last month telling the government the organisation would stand by the prosecution of more than half the cases of those convicted of fraud. Cleverly told Sky News:   That letter is not going to divert us from what we know to be the right course of action, which is do the right thing by hard-working people who found themselves, through no fault of their own, being targeted for criminal actions. So we are relentlessly focused on that, and that exchange won’t change that at all.      9.36am GMT  Home secretary backs speaker following Gaza ceasefire debate row  Home secretary James Cleverly firmly backed Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle amid criticism of his handling of the Gaza ceasefire debate. The senior Cabinet minister told Sky News on Friday:   I think the speaker has done a fantastic job. I think he’s been a breath of fresh air compared with his predecessor. He made a mistake. He’s apologised for the mistake. My view is that I’m supportive of him.  Cleverly said it was his personal view because the selection of the speaker is “house business” rather than for government ministers to decide.     9.27am GMT  Cleverly says politicians should not make decisions based on 'fear or favour'  Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. We start with news that the home secretary has said he would not “impinge on operational decisions” by the police when asked whether officers should have stopped a controversial pro-Palestinian message being projected onto Parliament. The phrase “from the river to the sea” was reportedly beamed onto the building on Wednesday as Gaza protesters descended on Westminster. James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:   It’s very difficult for me to second-guess the operational nature of this. I don’t know where those images were projected from. I don’t know how easy it would have been for the police officers to get there. But the fact is they are deeply, deeply offensive words... The implication is the eradication of the state of Israel. And both personally and as a government, we completely reject that.  He said the operational nature of policing was a matter for chief constables, the police commissioner Mark Rowley and mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Cleverly also said that politicians should not make decisions based on “fear or favour”. He told Sky News:   I’ve not had any specific threats brought to me, but we will stay constantly vigilant. But the point I would make is ultimately members of parliament and indeed elected officials through all layers of government have got to act without fear or favour. They need to be defended and we’re absolutely determined to do that.   "

        "content": "My father, Norman Howard, who has died aged 95, was a councillor for the Labour party from the mid-1960s onwards, and for a number of years from 1973 was chair of the Greater London Council’s planning committee. In that position he played a key role in decisions such as granting permission for Concorde to fly into Heathrow and on the redevelopment of Covent Garden. He also dug the first turf for the start of the London Docklands development at St Katharine Docks, and was particularly proud of signing an agreement with London Transport to carry out a 1973 election pledge allowing free bus travel for London’s pensioners. Having been a member of the Labour party since the age of 16, he began his political career as a public representative in 1964 when he was elected as a councillor for Kingston upon Thames in south-west London. Norman was born in Acton, west London, to Harold, a haulage contractor, and Alice (nee Goater). Alice died when Norman was eight, and two years later he, his older brother, Don, and youngest sister, Hazel, were evacuated in the first week of the second world war. Don left school before the war ended, but Norman and Hazel spent the next six years billeted, separately, with a variety of host families in Devon. Norman became head boy of Southwark Central school, which had been evacuated to Newton Abbot in Devon. However, when he returned to Acton at the end of the war, he had barely started in the sixth form before he was called up for national service, and his formal education ended.  In 1949 he started work as a darkroom assistant at a photographic printers in Ealing, west London, then moved to Southampton in 1951 to become a political agent supporting the successful re-election of the Labour MP Horace King (later to become speaker of the House of Commons). They formed a lifelong friendship, with King describing him as “a hard worker and a man of high integrity and honesty”. In 1956 Norman was invited to join the new London team of the leftwing newspaper Forward, and he subsequently worked as a journalist on Farmers Weekly, Reynold’s News (later renamed Sunday Citizen) and at the Board of Trade, before becoming assistant secretary at the Post Office Engineering Union in 1966. In 1984 he was appointed as chief press officer at British Telecom, for whom he worked, latterly on a consultancy basis, until he retired in 1998. Norman was then an active member of the Labour Heritage group, and co-founded and became secretary of the Aneurin Bevan Society. He also wrote a book, A New Dawn, about the 1945 Labour general election victory, which was published in 2005. It was in Southampton that Norman met and married Joyce Randell. She died in 2014. He is survived by his children, Jane and me, four grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and his sister, Hazel."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has hit out at the behaviour of protesters who he says are threatening MPs, after warnings that politicians’ safety was put at risk during this week’s chaotic parliamentary debate on Gaza.\nThe prime minister said on Friday it was “unacceptable” for MPs to feel intimidated in their jobs, amid a row over whether the Commons speaker was right to bend parliamentary rules this week in an effort to protect MPs’ safety.\nSunak told reporters during a tour of north Wales: “It’s simply unacceptable for intimidation or aggressive behaviour to threaten our parliamentary democracy and our freedom of expression.\n“Some of the scenes we’ve been seeing in recent months, particularly antisemitic behaviour, are appalling and unacceptable.”\nHis words were echoed by James Cleverly, the home secretary, who told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If you can’t make your arguments in a way that means you win a majority at an election, then it is not appropriate for you to try and force your opinion through intimidatory actions in people’s places of work.”\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, agreed, saying: “It’s a disgrace to have protests that target MPs’ homes and also councillors’ homes as well. It affects people’s families. It’s a deliberate attempt at intimidation.”\nThe comments follow a protracted row over whether Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, was right to ignore precedent on Wednesday and allow a vote on a Labour amendment calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\nHoyle said on Thursday he had acted because of concerns from MPs that their safety would be put at risk if they were not allowed to record their vote for a ceasefire but only under certain conditions.\nConservative and Scottish National party MPs have complained about Hoyle’s actions, which also averted a major rebellion on the Labour benches. The move reignited a debate about MPs’ safety, with several politicians saying they had been intimidated by pro-Palestinian protesters since a similar vote in November.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSome MPs have sought police protection since that vote, while others now carry panic alarms and have sought to have their home addresses removed from the internet.\nThe government commissioned a report by Lord Walney into political violence. The crossbench peer submitted his review in December.\nCleverly told Sky News it would say: “There is also an absolute requirement to make sure that we defend democracy [and] that people who make decisions in government at whatever level are doing so based on their judgment, based on the information, based on their beliefs, not based on fear of reprisals.”\nHowever, the home secretary rejected the idea that the police needed new powers to monitor protests, adding: “We want [officers] to understand that they have our back and when they use those powers.”\nCleverly also hit back at controversial comments by his predecessor, Suella Braverman, who wrote in the Telegraph on Friday: “The Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now.”\nThe home secretary told Times Radio: “We have a high-functioning democracy. We live by the rule of law. And I don’t think it is right or appropriate to imply anything other than that.”\nThe comments add to a continuing debate over what form of political protest are valid.\nOn Thursday, the Labour MP Stella Creasy complained about an article in the Guardian in which Sarah Lunnon, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil, justified targeting MPs. In December, Just Stop Oil activists sang protest Christmas carols outside Keir Starmer’s house, while Greenpeace protesters occupied the roof of Rishi Sunak’s home in North Yorkshire last summer when he was away on holiday.\nCreasy warned that politics was “drowning in hate and violence”, adding: “Climate protesters picketing MPs’ houses is no more acceptable than the threats I have received from anti-abortion campaigners.”\nLunnon responded on Friday, telling the BBC she felt her safety was being put at risk because of the climate crisis."

        "content": "Lindsay Hoyle has come out fighting against attempts to oust him as Commons speaker as Rishi Sunak criticised his “very concerning” choice over the Gaza debate.\nHoyle is under pressure after 67 Conservative and SNP MPs signed a motion calling for a vote of no confidence in him.\nThe furore erupted on Wednesday when Hoyle changed parliamentary procedure to allow a Labour amendment on Gaza to be debated to help stave off threats to MPs, sidelining the SNP’s original motion.\nSunak said on Thursday that Hoyle had changed the “usual ways in which parliament works”, which he said was “very concerning”, arguing that parliamentarians should never be intimidated by “extremists”.\nHe also said the speaker had “apologised for that and is going to reflect on what happened”, indicating that he appeared to be willing to draw a line under the episode for now, while government sources said they were not backing demands for Hoyle’s removal.\nSunak said: “I think the important point here is that we should never let extremists intimidate us into changing the way in which parliament works. Parliament is an important place for us to have these debates. And just because some people may want to stifle that with intimidation or aggressive behaviour, we should not bend to that and change how parliament works. That’s a very slippery slope.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBy Thursday evening momentum against the speaker appeared to be slowing. The Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell, who led for the government during the Gaza debate, told Times Radio: “If you ask me whether I am calling for his head, the answer is I’m not.”\nHe added: “The speaker must speak for himself, and as I said, I think it was a controversial thing to do. He has apologised for it. As far as I’m concerned, I’m prepared to leave it at that.”\nEarlier, Sunak’s spokesperson declined several times to express confidence in Hoyle, but the threat to the speaker’s future appeared to diminish as no government figures called for his resignation.\nHoyle on Thursday again apologised for a “wrong decision” and said his mistake had been made in pursuit of looking after MPs, after being told of “absolutely frightening” threats against them if the Labour position was not debated.\nThe SNP originally tabled a motion for debate calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, while Labour’s motion argued for the same with some conditions about pushing for a two-state solution and working with international partners. A Conservative motion also called for a ceasefire with an even longer list of conditions.\nHoyle’s decision to allow the Labour amendment led the government to withdraw its own motion on Gaza. The Labour motion subsequently passed, with Tory sources confirming that it was partly because they did not have enough time or votes to get their own amendment through the Commons.\nHoyle said the SNP could have an emergency debate on Gaza, but the offer failed to placate its Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, who said the speaker’s position was not tenable.\nPenny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, defended Hoyle as a “decent man”. But while the government is not pushing for his removal, Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, retweeted a scathing intervention from the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox saying Hoyle’s reasoning was unacceptable.\n“There are two possible explanations for the speaker’s decision to abandon longstanding convention,” Cox said. “First, he did it to assist his former party leader [to] get out of a bind. Secondly, as he says, he did it in a misguided attempt to protect certain Labour MPs from the intimidation they said would otherwise have followed if they had voted against the SNP motion.\n“Either reason is unacceptable. If the former, it is an abuse of his office. If the latter, it is an abject surrender to intolerance and tyranny; it meekly offers up the House of Commons as able to be influenced by external threats.”\nDuring an occasionally tense Commons session on Thursday morning, opinions were split over Hoyle’s fate. Addressing the speaker directly, Flynn said: “As I have expressed to you privately prior to proceedings here today, we do not on these benches believe that you can continue in your role as speaker if we do not have confidence in your ability to do so.”\nThe speaker received words of support from many MPs, including on the Conservative benches. Sir Edward Leigh, a Tory backbencher, said: “I think we should move on now and I would recommend that we don’t put in motions of no competence.”\nMark Francois, a veteran of the Tory right, spoke emotionally in Hoyle’s defence. Referring to the murder of his friend and fellow MP David Amess, Francois said: “I will remember everything that the speaker did to help me and all of us when our great friend, my best friend, was murdered … Mr Speaker went the extra mile for all of us to help us all deal with that tragedy.”\nKeir Starmer defended his decision to lobby Hoyle to allow the Labour amendment and rejected the idea that he had put pressure on him. Starmer met Hoyle hours before the vote, arguing that the speaker should ignore precedent.\nOn Thursday Starmer denied allegations of threatening the speaker, telling journalists on a visit in Sussex: “I can categorically tell you that I did not threaten the speaker in any way whatsoever. I simply urged to ensure that we have the broadest possible debate. So that actually the most important thing, which is what do we do about the situation in Gaza, could be properly discussed by MPs with a number of options in front of them.”"

        "content": "British Palestinians have described the chaotic scenes in the House of Commons over the Gaza ceasefire vote as a farce and “political game playing” after the speaker allowed a Labour amendment to be debated, overturning years of parliamentary precedent. Lindsay Hoyle went against convention by selecting the amendment for a vote as well as a government one. He has since come under pressure over his handling of the original Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Tory and SNP MPs accused him of bowing to pressure from Keir Starmer to allow the Labour motion, which was passed. Hoyle said later he had been persuaded to allow both amendments because of “absolutely frightening” threats to the personal safety of many MPs. The events were criticised by British Palestinians. Mira Hammad, 32, a British-Palestinian barrister, said the way the situation unfolded was “despicable”. “To hear it being blamed on Palestine protesters, and the idea that people protesting for Palestine are dangerous or a threat to MPs, is just really despicable,” she said.  “Palestinian lives are not a political game. There are real people that are human beings, it’s just disgusting to see this as a political game. “It’s absolutely disgusting that a conversation that should have been about the safety of an active population living under bombardment and undergoing a genocide has become about the safety of MPs due to legitimate protests.” Hammad added: “It just shows us that the horrors that are unfolding in Gaza couldn’t be further away from the concerns of the politicians in parliament.” Kamel Hawwash, 62, a British-Palestinian academic, said: “It should have been quite simple. Those who believe there should be a ceasefire would have voted yes. Those who side with Israel would have voted no. It would have been a real measure of these MPs and their humanity and their morals. Unfortunately, it became a farce. It became chaos. “I’m against protests outside MPs’ homes, but not outside their place of work or in their constituency offices. I think it’s legitimate for constituents to express their dissatisfaction and dismay at the lack of urgency to stop the killings in Gaza.” Sara Husseini, 40, the director of the British Palestinian Committee, said the leadership of both main parties were “determined to shield Israel from any criticism or accountability at the expense of democracy in this country and the UK’s legal and moral duties to the Palestinian people”. “British Palestinians, and the wider voting public, will not forget this,” she added. Hadil Louz, 30, a PhD student at the University of St Andrews who was born in Gaza, said efforts to apply pressure on parliament to call for a ceasefire had been in vain. “I’m not watching the news any more. I just want to bring my family to safety. I really suffered from the UK attitude and the parliament attitude towards the ceasefire. And I protested in London, I protested in Dundee, I protested in St Andrews, and everything was in vain,” she said.  “I appreciate the solidarity of the people who go to the streets asking for a ceasefire. I really appreciate their efforts going to the streets every Saturday and every week. I haven’t found any support from the government. But I really felt the support of the people in the UK.”"

        "content": "The parliamentary watchdog has launched an investigation into allegations that the pensions minister, Paul Maynard, used his taxpayer-funded constituency office as a Conservative campaign office. The investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which oversees expenses, follows reports that Maynard charged taxpayers when producing political materials. The MP for the marginal constituency Blackpool North and Cleveleys has said he will cooperate fully with the investigation, which has already been subject to a six-week assessment by Ipsa. Rishi Sunak already faces the prospect of a byelection in neighbouring Blackpool South after an independent panel this week upheld a 35-day suspension of Scott Benton, formerly a Tory MP, for offering to lobby ministers on behalf of the gambling industry. The Sunday Times reported in January that Maynard had claimed rent for an office that serves as his local party headquarters. It also alleged breaches including producing overtly political materials promoting the Conservatives and efforts to seek his re-election. Concerns were said to have been raised in summer 2022 by a member of the MP’s local Conservative association. The Sunday Times reported that the member had come forward after trying to raise alarm bells with the party. It published what it said was a recording of the member raising her concerns at a meeting, where Maynard could be heard saying: “Why are you trying to solve a problem we don’t have?” Confirming its investigation on Thursday, Ipsa said it would seek to determine whether the MP “has been paid an amount under the MPs’ scheme of staffing and business costs … that should not have been allowed”. The Liberal Democrats are calling on Sunak to withdraw the Conservative whip from Maynard while the “extremely serious” allegations are investigated. Maynard, who entered parliament at the 2010 general election and was previously a speechwriter and adviser for William Hague and Liam Fox, has been pensions minister since last November."

        "content": "Labour officials were upbeat on Wednesday evening as they weighed up the implications of the day’s dramatic events in Westminster. On the downside, the House of Commons had descended into farce as more than half the chamber left in protest at the decision by the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to allow a vote on Labour’s position on the war in Gaza. In doing so, Hoyle ignored years of precedent that states only one amendment should be brought to an opposition day motion – when smaller parties set the parliamentary agenda – and that any lodged by the government should take precedence. On the upside, Keir Starmer had avoided what was expected to be the biggest rebellion of his leadership, which would have included the resignation of at least two shadow cabinet ministers. By Thursday morning, however, the Labour leader found himself under fire for his last-minute visit to Hoyle before Wednesday’s debate, during which he successfully petitioned the speaker to allow the Labour amendment to be put to a vote. The Guardian has learned Starmer did not have an appointment to see Hoyle, but turned up unexpectedly to a planned meeting between the speaker and Alan Campbell, Labour’s chief whip. Sources briefed on the meeting said Starmer had not issued threats to the speaker, but instead focused on his belief that MPs’ security was at risk. Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative leader of the house, focused her anger directly on the Labour leader. “We have seen into the heart of Labour’s leadership – nothing is more important than the interests of the Labour party,” she said on Thursday morning. “The Labour party before principles, the Labour party before individual rights, the Labour party before the reputation and honour of the decent man that sits in the speaker’s chair.”   Related: Not acceptable for protesters to target MPs in their homes, says Stella Creasy   Starmer defended his actions during a visit to Sussex, telling reporters: “I can categorically tell you that I did not threaten the speaker in any way whatsoever. “I simply urged him to ensure that we have the broadest possible debate, so that actually the most important thing, which is what do we do about the situation in Gaza, could be properly discussed by MPs with a number of options in front of them.” Some Labour MPs were angry with their own leader for his actions on Wednesday, pointing out that because the government had decided not to oppose Labour’s motion, it passed without a vote being called. One said: “This looks beyond awful for Labour to the public, and will increase anger even further against us. I think that’s extremely dangerous when temperatures are already so high.” Others, however, said they were pleased that Starmer’s pressure on the speaker had avoided a scenario in which they looked like they were opposing a ceasefire in Gaza by voting against the Scottish National party (SNP) motion. Stephen Timms, the Labour backbencher, told GB News on Thursday: “There is a lot of anger around at the moment, around what’s happening in the Middle East. The Labour motion I think did provide a helpful way through. “It was in the end adopted and I’m pleased there is now a vote that has been recorded that the parliament has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.” Many Labour MPs were infuriated in November when they were whipped to vote against a similar SNP motion calling for a ceasefire because it did not represent the official Labour party position. Some say they have since faced threats to their safety from activists accusing them of being complicit in what is happening to civilians in Gaza. While some in the party were irritated that Starmer had only called for an immediate ceasefire because of an impending internal crisis, they also expressed relief that had finally happened. “It was madness,” said one Labour source. “But the most important thing is that Labour’s position has shifted significantly and MPs are able to say this is now our view: we believe in a ceasefire.”"

        "content": "A rule of thumb. When you’re in a hole, it’s generally best to stop digging. So after a spectacular display of pompous self-indulgence and partisan politics from MPs of all parties during an opposition day debate on Gaza the night before, the least you might have expected was a little contrition on Thursday morning. A walk of shame into the Commons. MPs trying not to catch one another’s eyes. We’ve all had a drink … And it all started off quite well during culture departmental questions. Everyone was determined not to mention the war. No, not that one in the Middle East. The one that had been fought across the dispatch box. The one that MPs were really bothered about. The speaker was also in his chair. Everyone wanted to pretend everything was normal. “Yes, Mr Speaker; no, Mr Speaker.” The only hint that anything was amiss was the excessive politeness. The tip-toeing continued through two urgent questions. The junior business minister Kevin Hollinrake bowing and scraping so low as he suggested Labour’s Kevan Jones knew far more about the Horizon Post Office scandal than he did. After the second UQ, on the government’s decision to cut funding to an inter-faith group – no one dared to point out the irony in the timing of this – Lindsay Hoyle made his excuses and left. It had been a long two hours for him. Exhausting. So it was left to the shadow leader of the house, Lucy Powell, to mention the elephant in the room during business questions. Lucy was never a prize student at charm school. She finds it easier to make enemies than friends. There is a brusqueness to her. An awkwardness she can’t quite shake off. But she wanted to try to make amends for Wednesday’s fiasco. An olive twig. If not a branch. It was like this, she said. She accepted that Labour hadn’t exactly covered itself in glory. The party had been in a hole over the Gaza vote and had talked the speaker into changing the parliamentary procedures to get around it. The sort of thing any party would do in a similar situation. They could hardly be blamed for trying it on. But then no one was totally guilt-free. The Scottish National party had chosen the Gaza motion as much to embarrass Labour as anything else. It wasn’t as if the result of the vote would make a blind bit of difference to Israel or Hamas. And the Tories were in it up to their neck. They had tabled their own amendment that was almost identical to Labour’s purely as a wrecking motion and had been furious to be outmanoeuvred. They had then got panicked about losing their vote and had thrown their toys out the pram and walked out. Cue chaos. Powell paused, looked up from her script and made this offer. How about everyone owned up to their own part in the humiliation of the vanities? No need to make a big deal about it. Don’t worry about the embarrassing details. Just mumble something vaguely apologetic. Miss Otis Regrets. Enough to give the public the impression that MPs had a few basic signs of emotional intelligence. Then we could all move on. Pretend it had never happened. This sounded like a decent offer. Only not to the Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt. A walking disaster of emotional stupidity. Not to mention brazen dishonesty. A woman incapable of recognising the most basic truths. Who thinks that her brief cameo at the coronation has given her iconic status. A Britannia for the 21st century. Planet Earth to Penny. Planet Earth to Penny. Is there anyone there? Apparently not. All you did was carry a sword for a while. OK, you did it well. But it wasn’t that hard. You can’t go on expecting the rest of us to thank you for ever. Yet Penny is in Penny World. Seldom has any woman taken herself quite so seriously. Apart from Liz Truss, possibly. And just as deranged. Of all the days to launch your latest leadership bid, this was not the one. Not least because she’ll be lucky to keep her seat at the next election. Penny was all ice. The theatrical fury of the intellectually compromised. Unable to see that putting all the blame on to Labour and exonerating Hoyle was an untenable position. The speaker is not without agency. Worse, she had the nerve to pretend that all she cared about was the little people. The rights of the SNP. Mordaunt has never cared about the SNP. Walking out before the vote was all about creating a diversion away from a possible defeat for the government. Nothing more, nothing less. To pretend otherwise was an insult to the country. At a time when people were hoping for something better from their MPs, Penny chose to kick them in the teeth again. As for parliamentary conventions? She has never cared for them either. Anyone remember the prorogation? Mordaunt would rather you didn’t. Though she was a fan at the time. To their credit, Penny’s preening display of sanctimony was too much for many of her Tory MPs. It’s hard to imagine there ever being a time and place for such self-indulgent denial, but this certainly wasn’t it. Most chose to ignore her. To distance themselves from her by refusing to pander to her hauteur. Some took her on. None better than Mark Francois. Not a sentence I would ever imagine writing. Francois is often a purple ball of inchoate anger. Seething at a world he doesn’t understand. That refuses to bend to his will. On Thursday, the storm clouds had temporarily parted. No one came out well from the Gaza omnishambles. No one. That was directed pointedly at Penny. Nor was everyone perfect. Hoyle had admitted his mistake. Now was the time for forgiveness. Magnanimity. A time of grace. Not for the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn. He was going to pursue this one to the ends of the earth. Lindsay was guilty of the greatest possible sin. Crimes against the SNP. Flynn would be happy to take part in the firing squad. Though you might have thought he could have granted a royal pardon. The SNP was coming out of this one smelling of roses. With another opposition day debate in the bag. Then Hoyle himself intervened. Again he fessed up. He had made a mistake. He was sorry. He wished it had turned out otherwise. He hadn’t been nobbled by the Labour heavies. It had been the threat of violence to MPs. He couldn’t live with another phone call saying a friend had been murdered. Penny grunted. She wasn’t happy. Not ready to think through the implications of parliamentary democracy being undermined by terror groups. She tried to sound understanding but she spat out the words as if she had swallowed a wasp. Lindsay had been weak. Weak, I tell you. She would never have given in. Some things were worth dying for. And Erskine May was one of them."

        "content": "\n 5.25pm GMT \nAfternoon summary\n\n\nThe SNP MP David Linden has claimed that Sir Lindsay Hoyle will have resigned by the weekend. He made the prediction in an interview with the PM programme, hours after Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said his party, the third largest in the Commons, has collective lost confidence in the speaker. (See 12.43pm.) An early day motion expressing no confidence in Hoyle has now been signed by 67 MPs. But government ministers have been more eager to blame Labour for what happened last night, and Rishi Sunak has said that, while what happened was “very concerning”, Hoyle should get credit for his apology. Sunak implied he was not pushing for Hoyle’s removal. (See 4.28pm.)\n    \n\n\n\"The position of the speaker is untenable... By the time we get to the weekend, he will be gone.\"SNP MP David Linden tells #BBCPM that Sir Lindsay Hoyle turned the Commons into 'an absolute farce' and that 'he has got to go'. pic.twitter.com/DaT5ePWzu6— BBC Radio 4 PM (@BBCPM) February 22, 2024\n\n\n\nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy has said there is no justification for MPs to be targeted in their homes and that public life is “drowning in hate and violence”.\n\n\nMinisters have vowed to press ahead with legislation to automatically overturn convictions related to the Post Office Horizon scandal by the end of July.\n\n\nVaughan Gething’s campaign to become the new Welsh first minister has had a setback after it emerged that he accepted a £200,000 donation from a company run by a man convicted of environmental offences.\n\n\nThe US, UK and Germany have endorsed the candidacy of the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, to become the next secretary general of Nato.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.30pm GMT\n\n\n 5.03pm GMT \nGove refuses to criticise Hoyle over his Gaza vote decision, saying 'you've got to respect the ref'\n\nMichael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has refused to criticise Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, for his decision to allow a vote on Labour’s amendment in the Gaza ceasefire debate yesterday. Echoing the approach taken by his cabinet colleague Penny Mordaunt (see 11.48am), Gove instead claimed Labour was to blame for the events that led to the debate ending in chaos and acrimony.\nIn an interview with the Sun, Gove said:\n\nI don’t think this issue is really about the speaker.\nIf you’re a government minister like me, you’ve got to respect the ref – even if you disagree with his decisions.\nI like Lindsay …\nThe thing I regret is that Keir Starmer is allowing himself and the Labour party to be dictated by fear and intimidation.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.12pm GMT\n\n\n 4.55pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 4.50pm GMT \nFormer government food tsar Henry Dimbleby calls for ban on advertising foods high in fat, salt and sugar\n\nThe government’s former food tsar has called for a ban on advertising foods high in fat, salt and sugar and warned that such products are now the dominant threat to public health. \nHenry Dimbleby, who resigned from his post last year citing government inaction on obesity, told the Lords food, diet and obesity committee today that poor quality food had become “by far the biggest cause of avoidable illness.” He said:\n\nThis is going to be one of the increasing problems facing society over the next 10 years and if we don’t get a grip on it, because of that lack of productivity, it will not only make us sick as a society, it will make us poor as well, and we are behind the curve.\n\nA pre-watershed ban on TV adverts for foods high in fat, salt and sugar was due to come into force in January 2023, but delays ordered by Boris Johnson and subsequently Rishi Sunak mean it will not be implemented until 2025 at the earliest. \n“I would restrict advertising of all of this food,” Dimbleby told the committee, adding that a ban should apply after the 9pm watershed as well as before. “I would just say you can’t advertise it.”\nThe Lords inquiry is gathering evidence on the role of ultra-processed foods and foods high in fat, salt and sugar, in driving obesity and other medical conditions. Ultra-processed foods tend to contain artificial colours and flavours, and ingredients such as emulsifiers and sweeteners, and are formulated to make them extremely palatable.\n“The purpose of ultra processed food is to drive excess consumption,” Dr Chris van Tulleken, a clinical research fellow at University College London and author of the book, Ultra-Processed People, told the inquiry. “It is very normal to eat 80% of your calories from ultra-processed food in this country,” he added.\nDimbleby was highly critical of advertising that targeted children, describing Coco Pops as “the breakfast cereal that’s a pudding”, and said ultra-processed foods and other foods high in fat, salt and sugar should be labelled as unhealthy using black octagon symbols adopted in other countries.\nHe also called for substantial support for people in poverty, including fruit and veg vouchers, to make healthy food more affordable, and a salt and sugar reformulation tax, adding that this would not increase the price of food. “You have to restrict the commercial incentives of companies,” he said. “There is no version of the future that looks good if that doesn’t happen.”\n\n\n\n 4.43pm GMT \nGove's decision to close down funding for group promoting Muslim-Jewish dialogue condemned as 'extraordinarily stupid'\n\nThe government has been accused of shutting down the main forum for Muslim-Jewish dialogue in the UK at an “extraordinarily stupid” time, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe Inter Faith Network, founded in 1987 with the aim of helping to promote good relations between people of different faiths across the UK, said it would confirm on Thursday whether the charity will close.\nThe government had previously said that, because a member of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) was appointed to the charity’s “core governance structure” last year, it had decided to withdraw the offer of new funding for the organisation.\nAnswering a Commons urgent question on the situation, Felicity Buchan, a levelling up minister, told MPs: “As this house will be aware, successive governments have had a longstanding policy of non-engagement with the MCB. The appointment of an MCB member to the core governance structure of a government-funded organisation therefore poses a reputational risk to government.”\nShe said Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, had “carefully considered” points raised by the IFN after the appointment but had concluded these were “outweighed by the need to maintain the government’s policy of non-engagement with the MCB and the risk of compromising the credibility and effectiveness of that policy”.\nBut Labour MP Sir Stephen Timms criticised the decision and the timing, especially in light of the chaotic scenes in the Commons just a day earlier over a vote on Gaza.\nTimms said: “Is it not, given the debate in this chamber yesterday, extraordinarily stupid to be shutting down at this precise point our principal vehicle in the UK for Muslim-Jewish dialogue? Surely we need more, not to be shutting that down?”\nHe said the charity had made a “very important contribution” to the UK for almost four decades.\nConservative former minister Theresa Villiers described the current situation as “regrettable”. She said: “I completely understand the importance of not engaging with organisations which have hardline views but surely we can find a compromise to keep the IFN in business? Because they do do some incredibly valuable work in fostering respect and mutual understanding between different faith groups.”\nLabour MP Barry Sheerman said of the funding withdrawal: “It’s the wrong time, and the wrong move.”\nA spokesperson for the department said: “Interfaith work is hugely important but that does not require us to use taxpayer money in a way that legitimises the influence of organisations such as the MCB. The Inter Faith Network cannot rely on continuous taxpayer funding. We regularly remind our partners, including the IFN, of the importance of developing sustainable funding arrangements, rather than relying on taxpayers’ money, which can never be guaranteed.”\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm GMT\n\n\n 4.34pm GMT \n\nThe number of MPs signing the early day motion expressing no confidence in Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, reach 65 this afternoon – 10% of the parliamentary total. But it has now fallen back to 64, because the Conservative MP Philip Dunne has withdrawn his name.\n\n\n\n 4.28pm GMT \nSunak says Hoyle's decision to change Commons rules 'very concerning' - but gives credit to speaker for his apology\n\nRishi Sunak has thrown a partial lifeline to Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, giving him credit for his apology for the decision he took last night.\nIn a clip for broadcasters in Angelsey this afternoon, asked if Hoyle had his backing, Sunak replied:\n\nWhat happened in the House of Commons last night is very concerning.\nIt seems that the usual processes and the way that the House of Commons works were changed. Now my understanding is that the speaker has apologised for that and is going to reflect on what happened.\n\nThis morning No 10 refused to say Sunak had confidence in Hoyle. In his clip this afternoon, Sunak did not give the speaker his full-throated backing, but he implied he was willing to draw a line under the matter.\nBut Sunak also said he was concerned about the notion the extremists could parliamentary procedure. He said:\n\nThe important point here is that we should never let extremists intimidate us into changing the way in which parliament works.\nParliament is an important place for us to have these debates. And just because some people may want to stifle that with intimidation or aggressive behaviour, we should not bend to that and change how parliament works. That’s a very slippery slope.\n\n\n\n\n 3.53pm GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nI am hoping you may be able to clarify something on yesterdays events, Am I correct in thinking that if the Tories had used their majority to vote down the Labour amendment then the voting procedure would have proceeded exactly as the SNP had wanted original (vote on the motion then government amendment)? Was there really a danger of the Labour amendment passing or were the Tories just concerned about a sizeable rebellion?\n\nYes, you are exactly right.\nAs for why the Tories did not just vote down the Labour amendment and the SNP proposition, this morning Maria Caulfield, a minister, was denying claims that it was because they would lose. (See 10.27am.)\nIf that were true, why did they not just vote down the two opposition propositions, and vote in theirs? In her statement to MPs last night, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, implied the Tories were doing this as a protest against the speaker trampling over the procedural rights of the SNP. But if the Tories had been able to vote down the Labour amendment, the SNP would have been happy – because they would have got a vote on their motion.\nColleagues have been looking into this more closely than I have believe the Tories were worried about losing the vote, and that this is the reason for what they did. \nCaulfield was right when she said this morning that Tory MPs were united in voting down an SNP ceasefire amendment in November.\nBut circumstance have changed considerably since then. And while most Tory MPs would have been happy to vote against the SNP motion, I think, because it accused Israel of engaging in the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, it is likely that a chunk of them would have refused to vote against the Labour one, which contained almost nothing in it that couldn’t have been written by David Cameron.\n\n\n\n 3.21pm GMT \n\nConservative voters would rather have Rishi Sunak as party leader than any of the main candidates seen as rival leaders, according to polling by Savanta. This contradicts the claims being made by some rightwingers about a rightwing alternative being more popular with the party’s core vote. \nBut, amongst all voters, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, would make a more popular Tory leader than Sunak, the poll suggests.\nEleanor Langford from the i has posted the chart on X.\n\n\n🔴 EXC New polling from @Savanta_UK shows that Sunak is still the preferred choice among Tory voters, while Badenoch would lose out to nearly every potential rivalBraverman is the least likely to be chosen out of all candidatesRead the full story here: https://t.co/zQZgGcPW1f pic.twitter.com/dO2OkDR4aS— Eleanor Langford (@eleanormia) February 22, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.08pm GMT \nBill to clear victims of Horizon scandal will assume Post Office was 'discredited' as prosecuting authority, minister says\n\nAt PMQs yesterday Rishi Sunak said that the legislation to exonerate post office operators whose convictions are regarded as unsafe because of the Horizon scandal will be published “very, very soon”. In a Commons written statement today, Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, has set out at some length details of the cases that will be covered.\nOne factor applied by the legislation will be an assumption that prosecutions that were brought by the Post Office were inherently unreliable. He says:\n\nThe legislation will specify who the prosecutor was in the relevant case. The Horizon inquiry has heard evidence of the egregious behaviour of the Post Office’s investigatory practices. It is therefore proportionate that the government legislates to quash these prosecutions where the prosecutor is, in effect, discredited.\n\n\n\n\n 2.31pm GMT \n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, has now signed the Commons early day motion expressing no confidence in Sir Lindsay Hoyle. There are now 61 MPs backing it.\n\n\n\n 2.26pm GMT \n\nAt first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament the Commons chaos was ignored entirely as opposition leaders tore into the SNP on domestic challenges.\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross led on a “damning” report published this morning by Audit Scotland that said the increased pressure on the NHS was now having a direct impact on patient safety, as the service found itself unable to meet growth in demand.\nRoss quoted the report stating there was no “overall vision” for the future of the health service.\nBut Humza Yousaf, the first minister, insisted that, while he took the report “very seriously”, there was record investment and staffing in the NHS in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar clashed with Yousaf on Labour’s proposed windfall tax, which the first minister attacked as putting thousands of jobs at risk earlier in the week. Sarwar accused Yousaf of siding with the energy giants over working people and made the comparison that is likely to feature heavily in forthcoming election leaflets: that Yousaf appears to be defending big energy companies from paying more tax on their profits, while anyone earning over £28,000 in Scotland pays more income tax. \n\n\n\n 2.11pm GMT \n\nThis is what the Conservative MP Derek Thomas told the World at One about why he has signed the EDM expressing no confidence in Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\n\nI am an MP who lived through the Brexit years where parliament just was not functioning, we weren’t able to represent or serve our constituents as we should have been, and so much of that was because the speaker at the time [John Bercow] just tended to veer away from what would have been described as the normal way of running things in the House of Commons. \nAnd, unfortunately for me, yesterday was just a return to that, and I immediately felt deeply uncomfortable about what was being done, what the speaker had proposed, how he had taken away the right of the SNP to hold their debate as they normally would. It does not work for anyone, or serve any of our constituents.\n\nThomas said that “this close to an election” the Common could not afford to have a speaker lacking judgment in that way.\nBut, when asked if the EDM would make a difference, he replied:\n\nIf Lindsay survives, it will certainly help maybe just for him to realise that to do anything that goes against his own clerk’s advice is not wise counsel. Maybe it will just help to correct things, and be a warning shot across the bow to make sure that parliament generally works.\n\n\n\n\n 1.59pm GMT \n\nHere is Guardian video of Penny Mordaunt’s intervention in the Commons earlier, where she defended Sir Lindsay Hoyle and accused Labour of undermining him.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.49pm GMT \nHoyle's appeal to MPs - snap verdict\n\nBusiness questions is now over. The highlight came towards the end, when Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, responded to a question from Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, in which Flynn said that the SNP has decided collectively it no longer has confidence in Hoyle. He called for a no confidence vote. (See 12.43pm.)\nIn response, Hoyle in essence pleaded for his job. He said that he had made a judgment call that turned out to be wrong and he apologised almost grovellingly to the SNP. But then, quite movingly, he talked about the “absolutely frightening” material he has been shown about the threat to MPs, and he stressed his commitment to keeping people safe. I’ve beefed up the post at 12.45pm about his words with direct quotes. (You may need to refresh the page to get the update to appear.)\nWas it enough? No 10 refused to express confidence in Hoyle earlier, which suggests Rishi Sunak is still sitting on the fence (one of his less edifying habits – remember how he avoided taking a stance on the standards committee report into Boris Johnson). Sunak may be waiting to see where the consensus view in the Conservative party settles before expressing a view in public.\nBut at this point it looks as if the threat to Hoyle’s future may be receding. During business questions there was no Tory anti-Hoyle feeding frenzy, and instead he received support from government backbenchers, including some who have not been shy of picking fights with previous speakers. (See 12.45pm and 12.22pm.) Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, praised Hoyle repeatedly as a “decent man” and played down prospects of allowing a no confidence vote. (See 12.43pm.) Within the past two hours only two new signatures have been added to the no confidence early day motion, where numbers are now stuck at 59. And one of those Tories who did sign it, Derek Thomas, suggested on the World at One only a few minutes ago that, if the EDM were to result not in Hoyle’s resignation, but in the speaker just being a bit more careful about making anti-Tory rulings next time, he would regard that as an acceptable outcome.\n\nUpdated at 2.22pm GMT\n\n\n 1.16pm GMT \n\nThe speaker is offering to allow an emergency debate on Gaza, not an emergency no confidence vote in himself, sources have confirmed. (See 1.07pm.)\n\n\n\n 1.07pm GMT \n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, offered to let the SNP hold an emergency debate. (See 12.45pm.) I interpreted that that as his offering an emergency no confidence debate, but colleagues who were in the chamber have interpreted that as a reference to an emergency Gaza debate. We are seeking clarification, but I have amended the headline in the meantime.\n\n\n\n 12.55pm GMT \nStarmer defends lobbying Hoyle over Gaza vote, but insists he never threatened him 'in any way whatsoever'\n\nKeir Starmer has defended his decision to lobby Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, yesterday over the Gaza debate. Starmer met Hoyle in person, hours before the vote, arguing that the speaker should ignore precedent and allow a vote on the Labour motion.\nBut Starmer denied threatening the speaker. Speaking to journalists on a visit in Sussex, he said:\n\nI can categorically tell you that I did not threaten the speaker in any way whatsoever.\nI simply urged to ensure that we have the broadest possible debate.\nSo that actually the most important thing , which is what do we do about the situation in Gaza, could be properly discussed by MPs with a number of options in front of them.\n\nThe allegation that Starmer may have threatened Hoyle with the prospect of Labour not voting to reappoint him after the election if he did not back them yesterday was prompted by tweets posted by Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt yesterday. But, as Watt explained on the Today programme this morning, he was never suggesting that this was something being said by Starmer; his tweets were about what other Labour figures have been saying in private in recent days. (See 10.45am.)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.22pm GMT\n\n\n 12.45pm GMT \nHoyle apologises to SNP, offers to let them hold emergency debate, but defends wanting to protect MPs\n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, is responding to Flynn.\n\nI will reiterate I made a judgment call that didn’t end up in the position where I expected it to.\nI regret it. I apologise to the SNP … I apologise and I apologise to the house. I made a mistake. We do make mistakes. I own up to mine.\nI would say that we can have an SO24 [standing order 24 – a procedure, normally used a handful of time a year, that allows a three-hour emergency debate to happen if an MP requests on and the speaker agrees it is necessary] to get an immediate debate because the debate is so important to this house.\nI will defend every member in this House. Every member matters to me in this house.\nAnd it has been said, both sides, I never ever want to go through a situation where I pick up a phone to find a friend, of whatever side, has been murdered by terrorists.\nI also don’t want another attack on this House. I was in the chair on that day.\nI have seen, I have witnessed, I won’t share the details, but the details of the things that have been brought to me are absolutely frightening on all members of this house, on all sides.\nI have a duty of care, and I say that, and if my mistake is looking after members I am guilty.\n\nAll MPs are at risk, he says. He had serious meetings with the police yesterday. Heading into the election, there are threats.\nHe repeats the point that he is offering an SO24 debate.\nThere are cheers as he sits down.\nUPDATE: Hoyle, the speaker, offered to let the SNP hold an emergency debate. I interpreted that that as his offering an emergency no confidence debate, but colleagues who were in the chamber have interpreted that as a reference to an emergency Gaza debate. We are seeking clarification, but I have amended the headline in the meantime.\nFURTHER UPDATE: Hoyle was offering an emergency debate on Gaza, not on his future, sources say.\n\nUpdated at 2.20pm GMT\n\n\n 12.43pm GMT \nMordaunt says MPs should 'take time to reflect' before deciding whether to hold no confidence vote in speaker\n\nPenny Mordaunt, the Commons leader, says she will protect the rights of all minority parties in the house. MPs create the rules of the house. Given the range of views expressed today, and the many supportive ones, they should “take time to reflect”, she says.\nThe government will listen to the house, she says.\n\n\n\n 12.43pm GMT \nStephen Flynn says SNP no longer has confidence in speaker and calls for no confidence vote\n\nIn the Commons Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said the best and worst of the place was on display yesterday.\nThings “descended into farce” because of the decision taken by the speaker, he says, addressing Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is in the charge.\nThe debate turned into a Labour debate. That is not acceptable.\nHe says as a result the SNP does not believe Hoyle should remain as speaker. They do not have confidence in him.\nHe asks what can be done to schedule a confidence vote in the chamber.\n\n\n\n 12.22pm GMT \n\nMark Francois (Con) said last night was not good for the Commons. But he said that Sir Lindsay Hoyle had apologised, and expressed contrition, and he said MPs should respect that.\nHe praised Hoyle for the support he offered following the murder of Sir David Amess, Francois’ close friend. Hoyle was “a decent man”, he said, and “not the villain here”.\nHe said the Commons should re-run the debate, with Hoyle in the chair. “We are lucky to have him,” he said.\n\n\n\n 12.19pm GMT \n\nThe Conservative MP William Wragg, who has tabled the early day motion expressing no confidence in Sir Lindsay Hoyle, asked Mordaunt how he could secure a vote on this.\nMordaunt gave a non-committal answer. She said the government would always listen to requests for a debate, but insisted other routes to getting something debated were available too.\n\n\n\n 12.17pm GMT \n\nAsked by Debbie Abrahams (Lab) if she could assure MPs that they would get the chance to have another vote on Gaza, Mordaunt said there would be “ample opportunities in the future” for such a debate.\n\n\n\n 12.15pm GMT \n\nSir Edward Leigh (Con) told the Commons that the speaker has admitted he made a mistake. The Commons should now “move on”, he said. He said he was opposed to a no confidence motion.\nHe also called for a government debate on Gaza, to allow all amendments to be considered.\nMordaunt said the speaker was meeting all the parties. She said she hoped all sides would reflect on their actions, as the speaker has done.\nUPDATE: Leigh said:\n\nThose who put pressure on the speaker to break with convention should reflect on their actions and if it was because members of parliament could be intimidated or at risk for how they voted that is even worse and actually quite frightening.\nHaving said that I think the speaker has said he made a mistake and the house relies on us having confidence in the speaker, I think we should move on now and would recommend that we don’t put in motions of no confidence but actually we restore our reputation as soon as possible by having a proper debate on a government motion where all amendments can be considered.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.03pm GMT\n\n\n 12.12pm GMT \n\nBack in the Commons Vicky Ford (Con) says she has faced hostility because of the way she has voted on issues, with her votes being misinterpreted. She says that in the European parliament there is a mechanism allowing MEPs, after a vote, to post an explanation of what they voted as they did, and what they did then. She urges Penny Mordaunt to allow the same thing to happen in the Commons. \nMordaunt she will consider this proposal.\n\n\n\n 12.07pm GMT \nNo 10 refuses to say whether Rishi Sunak has confidence in Lindsay Hoyle as Commons speaker\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson repeatedly refused to say whether Rishi Sunak has confidence in Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, Kevin Schofield from HuffPost UK reports.\n\n\nNEW: Prime minister’s spokesman repeatedly refuses to say whether Rishi Sunak has confidence in Lindsay Hoyle.“The prime minister’s focus is on addressing the situation in the Middle East,” he says.— Kevin Schofield (@KevinASchofield) February 22, 2024\n\n\n\nNEW: Prime minister’s spokesman repeatedly refuses to say whether Rishi Sunak has confidence in Lindsay Hoyle.“The prime minister’s focus is on addressing the situation in the Middle East,” he says.\n\nUPDATE: Here is the full quote from the PM’s spokesperson when asked if Sunak had confidence in Hoyle.\n\nThe prime minister’s focus is on addressing the situation in the Middle East. And as I say, that is what he’s spending his time focused on.

It was “completely shameful”, she says.\nBut she claims she wants to “take the heat out of this”.\n\n\n\n 11.55am GMT \n\nOwen Thompson, the SNP chief whip, says yesterday was one of only three opposition days the SNP gets in a parliamentary session.\nHe says in practice the SNP did not get an opposition day yesterday. He says his party should be compensated for this. And he asks what protection will be offered for the smaller parties in Commons procedure.\nHe also calls for an investigation into claims that Sir Lindsay Hoyle was pressurised by Keir Starmer into allowing a vote on the Labour amendment.\nHe said he had been assured in advance he would get the chance to vote on the SNP motion. That did not happen because the advice of the clerks was over-ruled to dig Labour out of a hole, he says.\n\nUpdated at 12.04pm GMT\n\n\n 11.49am GMT \n\nSir Bernard Jenkin (Con) urges the government to schedule a debate in government time on Gaza, so all amendments can be put to a vote.\nMordaunt says she will speak to business managers about this.\n\n\n\n 11.48am GMT \nPenny Mordaunt describes Hoyle as 'decent man' and accuses Labour of undermining his office\n\nPenny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, is now responding to Lucy Powell.\nShe says “this house will never bow to extremists, threats or intimidation”.\nShe says to suggest that the “shameful events” that took place yesterday were anything other than party politics is to do a disservice to the house.\nShe says it fell to the government to defend the rights of a minority party (the SNP) in the house. She says Powell should rise above defending the needs of her “weak” leader. Labour should reflect on the damage it has done to the office of the speaker, she says.\nAnd she says this episode has illustrated that nothing is more important to the Labour party than its own interests. It has put its own priorities above the interests of the “decent man” who serves as speaker.\nShe claims that at least Jeremy Corbyn, the previous Labour leader, genuinely believed in his positon on Gaza. She claims Keir Starmer was not sincere in his position, and that this shows he is not fit to lead.\nUPDATE: Mordaunt said:\n\nThis House will never bow to extremists, threats, or intimidation. It has not, it will not, it must not.\nAnd I would ask all honourable members not to do this house a further disservice by suggesting that the shameful events that took place yesterday were anything other than party politics on behalf of the Labour party …\nIt fell to the government benches to defend the rights of a minority party in this House.\nIf the [Lucy Powell] cannot bring herself to reflect on the appalling consequences of her party’s actions yesterday, if she cannot rise above the narrow and immediate needs of her weak and fickle leader to fulfil her duties to this house as its shadow leader, perhaps she might like to reflect on the damage her party has done to the office of the speaker.\nI would never have done to him what the Labour party have done to him.\nWe have seen into the heart of Labour’s leadership. Nothing is more important than the interests of the Labour party. The Labour party before principle, the Labour party before individual rights, the Labour party before the reputation and honour of the decent man that sits in speaker’s chair. The Labour party before fairness, integrity and democracy …\nWe often on this side of this house rightly criticise the former leader of the Labour party [Jeremy Corbyn] for the things he stood for being wrong on those matters.\nBut I will tell you one thing about the former leader of the Labour party, at least he thought he was right on those matters. The current leader of the Labour party is quite happy to do what he knows to be wrong.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.27pm GMT\n\n\n 11.42am GMT \nLabour's Lucy Powell urges government to do more to protect MPs from intimidation\n\nIn the Commons Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has just read out the business for the next two weeks. She did not mention the speaker, or last night’s debate. \nLucy Powell, the shadow leader, is speaking now. She says Sir Lindsay Hoyle acted with good intentions, and wanted MPs to have a wide choice when it came to the votes.\nShe says, given the SNP supported Labour’s motion, it was right that it was put to a vote.\nThe government’s decision to boycott the vote was “extraordinary”, she says.\nBut she says that it is “with regret” that parliament did not show itself at its best.\nThe Commons should have more time to discuss these matters. It should not be up to the opposition to schedule debates on Gaza.\nPowell turns to the security of MPs. Legitimate lobbying of MPs, including robust lobbying, is to be expected.\nBut increasingly a line is being crossed, she says. She condemns the protest outside Tobias Ellwood’s home. She asks if the government agree that the police should take a firmer line on these protests.\nAnd does the government agree that it should look at the causes of this. People should be careful about the language they used, she says. And more should be done to stop social media companies spreading hate, she says.\n\n\n\n 11.32am GMT \nTory MP Danny Kruger says Hoyle should go because he was willing to change democratic procedure in response to threat\n\nOne Tory argument against Sir Lindsay Hoyle is the claim that his decision yesterday was biased in favour of Labour. Another is that in deciding which amendments would and would not be put to a vote, partly in response to people issuing threats to MPs, he was setting a dangerous precedent. The Conservative MP Danny Kruger has made this case in posts on X this morning explaining he has signed the no confidence motion.\n\n\nI've signed the motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. This isn't personal: he's a decent man and I'm sure he thought he was doing the right thing yesterday. But Sir Lindsay allowed Labour to use the Islamist threat to change the way our democracy works. This is unacceptable. 1/— Danny Kruger (@danny__kruger) February 22, 2024\n\n\n\nI’ve signed the motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. This isn’t personal: he’s a decent man and I’m sure he thought he was doing the right thing yesterday. But Sir Lindsay allowed Labour to use the Islamist threat to change the way our democracy works. This is unacceptable. 1/\n\n\nStarmer is even more culpable. He should be standing for democracy and against mob rule. Instead he used the threat of violence for party political ends, to wriggle out of a crisis created by Labour’s unbridgeable division over Israel. 2/\n\n\nLike the Speaker, I daresay Starmer wants to do the right thing. But like the Speaker he showed weakness and partisanship yesterday. This was a harbinger of what a Labour government would bring: extremists de facto in charge, and the subversion of democracy. 3/\n\n\n(And for those shouting ‘prorogation’ remember: in 2019 we sought to restore Parly sovereignty and to ensure that proper procedure - that the Govt controls the order paper except on opposition days - was followed. We had a rogue Speaker then. We can’t have another one now.) 4/4\n\nDaniel Finkelstein, the Times columnist and Conservative peer, gave a fuller version of this argument earlier today in his own post on X.\n\nThis idea, common overnight among commentators, that last night was just embarrassing games and pomposity is quite wrong. If violent threat prompted the change in motion selection it could hardly be more serious.\nYet if it didn’t, it means the Speaker isn’t telling the truth and it might mean he was pressured by the opposition. Both of which are extremely serious.\nI can quite see why allowing Labour’s amendment (albeit an incoherent one) expanded choice but this isn’t the point at all. The point is the parliamentary procedure matters as does precedent and resistance to violent threat and the competence of the Speaker. These are not just sort of pomposity.\nI can’t believe some Labour centrists and media commentators argue this after all the discussion during the Johnson years about the importance of institutions and process. It’s like they didn’t mean their earlier critique at all. Which (and I am not being arch here) would be very disappointing and worrying.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.27pm GMT\n\n\n 11.22am GMT \n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle will not be taking any rash, early decisons about his future, Steven Swinford from the Times reports.\n\n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle is not planning to resign today and will conduct 'business as usual' in the face of mounting pressure from ministers and backbenchersThe Speaker will meet senior leaders but has been advised by allies against doing anything rash.All eyes on the no confidence…— Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) February 22, 2024\n\n\n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle is not planning to resign today and will conduct ‘business as usual’ in the face of mounting pressure from ministers and backbenchers \nThe Speaker will meet senior leaders but has been advised by allies against doing anything rash. \nAll eyes on the no confidence motion - more than 50 MPs have now put their name to it \nMinisters and PPSs now publicly saying they have lost confidence in him\n\n\n\n\n 11.19am GMT \nHoyle 'head and shoulders' better than last two speaker, says former Tory defence secretary Ben Wallace\n\nAn influential Conservative has spoken up for Sir Lindsay Hoyle this morning. At one point Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, was a favourite for party leader. In posts on X this morning, he has described Hoyle as the best speaker he’s known since he was elected in 2005.\n\n\nI have served under three speakers.

He is not a bully nor a grandstander nor pompous. He has my full support.\n\n\nThe real question we should ask ourselves is why Keir Starmer, the lawyer, seems to think Commons rules should not be followed.

That suggests it won’t be long before the tally reaches 65, which would represent 10% of the house. \nOn the plus side for Hoyle, he has the support of Labour, and the Labour leadership. Michael Martin was forced to resign as Commons speaker after both the government and oppostion leadership decided it was time for him to go. \nWhat is not clear, yet, is whether or not No 10 is going to decide that it wants him out. It has not indicated that so far, but if enough Tory MPs were to declare that they had lost confidence in Hoyle, Rishi Sunak could be persuaded to allow the Commons to put this matter to a vote. It must be a relief for Sunak to have Conservative MPs for once gunning for someone else, not him.\nIf the number of signatures on the EDM were to reach 100, a formal confidence vote would become much more likely. Nicholas Watt from Newsnight says there are some Conservatives who have not signed it yet but who will if Hoyle does not indicate he is going.\n\nSenior Tory MP tells me: A lot of us agree with Will Wragg’s EDM [Early Day Motion] but are reluctant to sign it.

Aged 66, he is currently expected to stand at the election and serve for another term as speaker. The last four speakers all stayed in office for roughly a decade.

What SNP MPs did was they went to the lobby, that’s the rooms beside the main parliamentary debating chamber, ready to vote, they were anticipating and expecting a vote.\nA number of MPs cross-party said they wanted their constituents to know where they stood on this and the problem with staged shenanigans was that MPs weren’t allowed to express their views in the lobbies and vote. \n\nOther MPs have told the Guardian that they went into the aye lobby to protest against the point that they weren’t getting the chance to vote on their original motion. This morning Westminster group sources say MPs feel frustrated and angry that the focus has now moved so far from Gaza and at the way Westminster conventions can be broken “when it suits”.\n\n\n\n 10.45am GMT \n\nIn his interview on the Today programme this morning Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, rejected claims that Keir Starmer told Sir Lindsay Hoyle that Labour MPs would not support his re-election as speaker after the next election if he did not allow a vote on the Labour amendment. McFadden said he had checked this out and the claim was “categorically untrue”.\nThe question was prompted by posts on X from Nicholas Watt, Newsnight’s political editor. But Watt told Today that his posts did not say that these threats had come from Starmer himself.

He said:\n\nIt’s not his fault that Maria [Caulfield]’s party puts forward a proposition then before the vote says, ‘we’re not going to vote on it, even though we’re the government, even though we’ve got a majority’ and the Speaker is taking the rap for that.

We just felt, as you saw the scenes unfolding, that we just couldn’t take part in this. That it wasn’t fair on the SNP and I’m not the SNPs biggest supporter, but to be fair to them, they had a right to have a vote on their debate. \nUntil Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, announced at the end of the debate that the Tories would not be participating, it had been expected that they would vote down the Labour amendment, vote down the SNP amendment, and then use their Commons majority to vote through their own amendment.\n\nWhen asked if she was sure Tories could have won the vote, Caulfield replied:\n\nYes, I think we’ve been pretty clear on that. We had a similar vote a few weeks ago, and the party, we were pretty united on that.

Here are posts from two of them on X.\nFrom Barry Sheerman\n\n\nLindsay Hoyle has been an exemplary Speaker the best I have known he is always fair & even-handed & has taken the most active role in the care & support of all Members he should be thanked & supported.— Barry Sheerman MP (@BarrySheerman) February 21, 2024\n\n\n\nLindsay Hoyle has been an exemplary Speaker the best I have known he is always fair & even-handed & has taken the most active role in the care & support of all Members he should be thanked & supported.\n\nFrom Jim McMahon\n\n\nHonestly, they need to grow up.Sir Hoyle is a good Speaker, a decent man and deserves better than this.Parliament needs to reflect on the division and anger too often exploited for political gain.

We should be coming together to lead the nation through these difficult issues.\n\n\n\n\n 9.45am GMT \nLindsay Hoyle has 48 hours to persuade MPs he deserves to stay on as speaker, says minister\n\nIn another interview this morning Maria Caulfield, the health minister, said that Sir Lindsay Hoyle had 48 hours to persuade MPs he should remain as Commons speaker.\nAsked if his position was now untenable, she told TalkTV:\n\nI voted for Lindsay as speaker of the House of Commons, so I was a big Lindsay Hoyle fan but his actions yesterday I’m very disappointed in. \nThere is a notice calling for a confidence vote on the speaker. He did apologise last night which I am giving him credit for doing that. He will be meeting with the leader of the house. It will depend on what he says over the next 24, 48 hours.\n\nShe said Hoyle might now be regareded as biased.\n\nThere can be no question that a speaker of the House of Commons is influenced by their own political party, and we need to be absolutely clear on that. We can’t function if there’s bias in the chair of the House of Commons.\n\n\n\n\n 9.32am GMT \n\nKiran Stacey has written a good backgrounder on how Keir Starmer managed to persuade Sir Lindsay Hoyle yesterday to ignore established procedural rules and to allow a vote on the Labour amendment. This is how it starts.\n\nOn Wednesday lunchtime Keir Starmer was facing the biggest crisis of his career.\nEarlier in the week, he had been warned that as many as 100 of his MPs – including at least two of his shadow cabinet – were willing to rebel by voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza unless Labour brought forward its own amendment calling for one.\nHaving agreed to publish exactly such an amendment, the Labour leader now faced another hurdle: the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, was being advised not to pick it and instead call a different one from the government.\nHours away from the biggest rebellion of his leadership, Starmer decided to intervene personally and visited Hoyle in his office behind the House of Commons chamber.\nThose briefed on the meeting said the Labour leader warned Hoyle that Labour MPs’ security was at risk. Many had been deluged by criticisms, threats and abuse since abstaining on a similar SNP motion in November. With hundreds of protesters congregating outside parliament, they worried worse might be to come.\n\nAnd here is the full article.\n\n Related: How Keir Starmer averted Gaza ceasefire vote crisis \n\n\n\n\n 9.27am GMT \nMinister says Lindsay Hoyle's position as speaker now 'difficult' after last night's Gaza vote debacle\n\nGood morning. Greg Power, who was an adviser to the late Robin Cook when he was leader of the Commons and who has spent the last two decades giving advice on strengthening parliamentary governance in developing countries around the world, has just published an unusual and insightful book on behaviour and political reform (Inside the Political Mind) and it starts with this observation that goes a long way to explain why parliament went into meltdown so dramatically last night.\n\nThe vast majority of parliamentary fights start with differences over policy. But what makes them combustible is when they turn into arguments about process. It is the belief that the rules are being abused, distorted or ignored in order to gain political advantage that creates such anger.\n\nWith that in mind, the events of last night, described here in Kiran Stacey’s overnight story, are easier to comprehend.\n\n Related: Commons speaker apologises after Gaza ceasefire debate descends into chaos \n\nToday it is Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, who is under most pressure. He is due to hold talks with the parties to clear the air, but 33 MPs (22 Tories, 11 SNP) have signed a Commons early day motion expressing no confidence in him. The Telegraph has splashed on the line that he is fighting to save his job.\n\n\nTELEGRAPH: Speaker on brink after walkout #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/1TO93rJlas— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) February 21, 2024\n\n\nBoth Hoyle’s predecessors had EDMs tabled expressing no confidence in them, and precedent suggests that EDMs on their own don’t matter. Speakers end up going when the government or opposition leadership turns against them, and this can happen if it becomes clear that they enjoy the broad support of the house as a whole.\nAnd that is why Maria Caulfield’s interviews this morning were interesting. Caulfield is a health minister. She was not explicitly delivering a government line on Hoyle (No 10, when asked questions about the speaker’s future, normally says that’s a matter for the Commons, not the government), but she did not give him her support.\nAs Aubrey Allegretti from the Times reported, on a Tory WhatsApp group last night Caulfield said Hoyle had been “completely irresponsible” in doing hat he did.\n\nTory WhatsApp groups are still alive with rage at the Speaker’s decision tonight.\nAnother minister - Maria Caulfield - breaks cover to claim Lindsay Hoyle knew “all the fire from protesters would be against us” by letting Labour motion be voted on - as Tories would oppose.\nShe says it was “completely irresponsible” for MPs’ safety.\n\n\n\nTory WhatsApp groups are still alive with rage at the Speaker’s decision tonight. Another minister - Maria Caulfield - breaks cover to claim Lindsay Hoyle knew “all the fire from protesters would be against us” by letting Labour motion be voted on - as Tories would oppose.…— Aubrey Allegretti (@breeallegretti) February 21, 2024\n\n\nThis morning Caulfield told Sky News that Hoyle’s position was now “difficult” and that she would struggle to support him.\nAnd she said his ruling was biased against the Conservatives. On the Today programme she said that Hoyle had arranged the votes to take place in such a way as to reduce the risk of Labour MPs having to make a choice that would expose them to threats, but to increase the risk of Conservative MPs having to make a choice that would expose them to threats. She explained:\n\nMy concern was that, because [Hoyle] came under undue pressure from the Labour leader, because Labour were worried about losing that vote, for whatever reason … that meant that we will be the only party who would not be supporting the SNP motion, and that all the fire would come on Conservative MPs.\nI just felt that you know, he was putting party politics above the impartiality of the speaker. He took the threat to Labour MPs seriously, but took no consideration of what would happen to Conservative MPs.\n\nCaulfield was referring to the fact that, if the votes had taken place yesterday in line with the established rules, Labour MPs would not have been able to vote on their own motion, but would have had to take a view on the SNP one. The last time this happened, many received threats for not voting with for the SNP ceasefire proposal.\nAs a result of the Hoyle ruling, the Tories would have had to vote down two immediate ceasefire motions – Labour’s and the SNP’s – if they wanted to vote for their own immediate humanitarian pause one. (Under the conventional rules, they would have only had to vote down the SNP one to get a vote on their own.)\nWe’ve got business questions coming up in the Commons later, and that should give some indication as to how much opposition there is to Hoyle. Judging by social media, Labour MPs are already running an operation to back him.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10.30am: Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, takes questions on next week’s Commons business.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\nAfternoon: Rishi Sunak is on a visit in north Wales.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "Dominic Raab is taking “leadership and career transition” advice as he embarks on a new £118,000-a-year job for a private equity mining company, according to the latest MPs’ register of interests. The former deputy prime minister, who is stepping down as an MP at the next election, listed a gift of pro bono services worth £20,000 from Manchester Square Partners, which describes itself as a “trusted adviser to leaders, defined by discretion and hidden by design”, with a purpose to “support leaders to be in control of their futures”. It is understood that Raab has made use of its “career transition” services rather than undertaking leadership training. Raab stepped down from his government role last April after a report on bullying allegations found he had acted in an “intimidating” manner towards civil servants. At the time, he rebutted the report, saying its conclusions set a dangerous precedent by setting the threshold for bullying “so low”. He announced in May that he would step down as an MP at the next election. Alongside his job as an MP, Raab has now taken on a role as a senior strategic adviser on global affairs for a private equity firm called Appian Capital. The company specialises in investment in the mining of critical minerals. He is charging £118,000 a year for his services, plus any applicable VAT, through a personal services company called Reya. Raab set up Reya, where he is an unpaid director, to undertake speaking engagements and paid advisory work. Earnings paid through a company rather than through payroll are liable for dividend tax rather than income tax. Raab is one of a string of Conservative MPs bolstering their income with second jobs, with an election looming in which many will stand down or are predicted to lose their seats. The former prime minister Theresa May recently declared an unpaid second job as an adviser to a firm called NorthStar, while the former minister Michael Ellis registered a role as a senior adviser to Candey, a law firm, receiving £70,000 a year. Other recent new additions to MPs’ job portfolios include Sir Graham Brady taking on a £36,000-a-year role as a non-executive director of the Scottish pharma company Medannex through his company Graham Brady Consulting. The Tory MP Mark Pritchard registered a new job in November paid £9,000 a month to provide marketing advisory services to ATS Group, a North Macedonia-based group specialising in “technology, a wide range of high-quality composite ballistic products, and the production of small-caliber ammunition”. Figures from last August showed MPs had been paid £10m from second jobs and freelance work over the past year, largely driven by former Tory ministers taking up a slew of well-paid roles. The analysis looked at all MPs who made more than £1,000 in the past year, excluding income from completing surveys. Even stripping out Boris Johnson’s £4.8m, about 90 other Conservative MPs brought in approximately £4.75m – an increase from nearer to £4m in 2021. In 2022, the government ditched plans to cap MPs’ income from second jobs, months after the issue provoked a sleaze scandal that plunged Johnson’s government into crisis. The promised clampdown followed the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal and a furore over Geoffrey Cox being paid nearly £6m as a lawyer since joining parliament, voting by proxy on days he was undertaking paid work."

        "content": "A leading Labour politician has said there is no justification for MPs to be targeted in their homes and that public life is “drowning in hate and violence”. Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that it was not acceptable to picket MPs in their home in response to an opinion piece by Just Stop Oil justifying the targeting of MPs. The Labour and Cooperative MP for Walthamstow in north-east London said that harassment towards political representatives was increasingly normalised and “climate protesters picketing MPs’ houses is no more acceptable than the threats I have received from anti-abortion campaigners”.   Related: Death and rape threats, bricks through windows: MPs must be able to serve without living in fear | Stella Creasy   She added: “All would argue their cause is vital and important that such tactics are merited – but to allow these behaviours to become the norm for any is therefore to enable it for all.” In an opinion piece on Wednesday, Sarah Lunnon, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil, wrote that no Labour MPs had responded to a request to commit to resigning if after six months their leadership continued to implement Tory oil and gas projects. She added: “That’s why we are asking Labour MPs at their offices, in their constituencies, and at their homes to find their courage – and end the Tory oil and gas policies that are wrecking stable society.” It was reported over the weekend that Just Stop Oil protesters were planning to occupy Labour MPs’ homes to push them on climate policies. Creasy said the abuse she has faced as an MP, including rape and death threats and a brick through her office window, were indicative of a serious problem that risked undermining democracy. “Unless we take responsibility for addressing this, the outcome will not simply be that the loudest voices and largest wallets win: democracy will lose,” she said. She added: “What we are seeing now is not simply a livelier version of public life. You cannot have free speech if 50% of a conversation is spent living in fear that saying no will mean a risk of harm to either yourself or someone you love.” MPs are increasingly being targeted in their homes. In December, Just Stop Oil activists sang climate change-inspired Christmas carols outside Keir Starmer’s house, while Greenpeace protesters occupied the roof of Rishi Sunak’s home in Yorkshire last summer when he was away on holiday. Creasy wrote: “Every MP has not just the shadow of the deaths of our beloved friends David Amess and Jo Cox looming in our thoughts, but also knowledge of the day-to-day violence our colleagues experience. I don’t need to agree with Tobias Ellwood or Mike Freer on policy to know that a line has been crossed when their private addresses and constituency offices have been targeted – and they are not alone.” Brendan Cox, whose wife, Jo Cox, was killed in 2016 after an attack outside her constituency office by a rightwing terrorist, agreed with Creasy’s stance. Cox said the reality was that in addition to the climate crisis, “there are so many issues that people think are the most important issues”, including Israel-Gaza, nuclear arms and abortion, and that if it becomes normal to target MPs at home it would happen more and more regularly. He told the Guardian: “It’s really important that we keep our spirit of healthy, active and sometimes rambunctious democratic disagreement but when we start to target people in their homes it tips over into the risk of intimidation and it will make members of parliament more worried for their personal security.” Cox also said allowing the targeting of MPs at home risked putting off the best people from running for parliament. “If we want to create a culture where we have really good MPs, particularly women and people from minority groups as well, if we want those people to stand for parliament then creating an environment which is hostile and full of intimidation means we’ll lose many of the best people and particularly certain groups of people who will be less up for that risk.”"

        "content": "Lindsay Hoyle has come out fighting in the face of Tory and Scottish National party attempts to oust him, as Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson repeatedly refused to say the prime minister has full confidence in him.\nAfter chaotic scenes during Wednesday’s Gaza ceasefire vote, Hoyle’s future as the Commons speaker is in doubt as the SNP said his position was untenable and dozens of backbench Tory MPs signed a motion calling for a confidence vote in him.\nHoyle is under pressure over his handling of an SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, after he opted to change parliamentary rules in order to let an alternative Labour amendment be debated as well as a government one.\nTory and SNP MPs accused him of bowing to pressure from Keir Starmer to allow the Labour motion, which was passed.\nHoyle once again apologised for a “wrong decision”, against the advice of the House of Commons clerks. He said his mistake had been in pursuit of looking after MPs, after being told of “absolutely frightening” threats against them if the Labour position was not debated.\nHe said the SNP could have an emergency debate on Gaza, but the offer failed to placate its Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHoyle’s decision to allow the Labour amendment led the government to withdraw its own motion on Gaza. The Labour motion subsequently passed, with Tory sources confirming that it was partly because they did not have enough time or votes to get their own amendment through the Commons. The SNP is furious that its original motion was sidelined.\nGovernment sources said they were not pushing to remove the speaker from office, and Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, defended him as a “decent man”.\n\n Related: The Commons needed to focus on the horror in Gaza. Instead this was a grubby game of political chess | Polly Toynbee \n\nHowever, Sunak’s official spokesperson declined to back him. When pressed several times on whether he had confidence in Hoyle, the spokesperson deflected the question. He said Sunak was purely focused on addressing the situation in the Middle East, and the question of the speaker was a matter for parliament.\nWhile the government is not pushing for his removal, Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, retweeted a scathing intervention from the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox saying Hoyle’s reasoning was unacceptable.\n“There are two possible explanations for the speaker’s decision to abandon longstanding convention,” Cox said. “First, he did it to assist his former party leader get out of a bind. Secondly, as he says, he did it in a misguided attempt to protect certain Labour MPs from the intimidation they said would otherwise have followed, if they had voted against the SNP motion.\n“Either reason is unacceptable. If the former, it is an abuse of his office. If the latter, it is an abject surrender to intolerance and tyranny; it meekly offers up the House of Commons as able to be influenced by external threats.”\nDuring an occasionally tense Commons session on Thursday morning, opinions were split over Hoyle’s fate. Addressing the speaker directly, Flynn said: “As I have expressed to you privately prior to proceedings here today, we do not on these benches believe that you can continue in your role as speaker if we do not have confidence in your ability to do so.”\nThe speaker also received words of support from many MPs, including on the Conservative benches. Sir Edward Leigh, a Tory backbencher, said: “I think we should move on now and I would recommend that we don’t put in motions of no competence.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMark Francois, a veteran of the Tory right, spoke emotionally in Hoyle’s defence. Referring to the murder of his friend and fellow MP David Amess, Francois said: “I will remember everything that the speaker did to help me and all of us when our great friend, my best friend, was murdered ... Mr speaker went the extra mile for all of us to help us all deal with that tragedy.”\nMordaunt said on Thursday that MPs “cannot adapt our processes and procedures in this place to not have difficult debates … we have to stand up for our constituents and make the judgments we think are right. If we are adapting the procedures of this house because we are fearful of the consequences of standing up and saying what we think is right, then democracy has failed and the extremists have won.”\nKeir Starmer defended his decision to lobby Hoyle to allow a Labour amendment on the Gaza debate. Starmer met Hoyle hours before the vote, arguing that the speaker should ignore precedent and allow a vote on the Labour motion.\nSpeaking on Thursday, he denied allegations of threatening the speaker, telling journalists on a visit in Sussex: “I can categorically tell you that I did not threaten the speaker in any way whatsoever. I simply urged to ensure that we have the broadest possible debate. So that actually the most important thing, which is what do we do about the situation in Gaza, could be properly discussed by MPs with a number of options in front of them.”"

        "content": "Vaughan Gething’s campaign to become the new Welsh first minister has had a setback after it emerged that he accepted a £200,000 donation from a company run by a man convicted of environmental offences. David John Neal was given a three-month suspended prison sentence in 2013 for illegally dumping waste on the environmentally sensitive Gwent Levels in south Wales. Gething, who would become the first black leader of a European country if he wins the race to replace Mark Drakeford, has received two donations of £100,000 each from the Cardiff company Dauson Environmental Group, of which Neal is a director. Another of Neal’s companies, Resources Management UK, recently faced action by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) after complaints about the smell at a landfill site called Withyhedge in Pembrokeshire. Residents called it “a stink bomb on steroids”. Asked about the donations at a BBC leadership debate, Gething said: “All donations are checked and filed properly with the Electoral Commission and declared to the Senedd. The issue in Pembrokeshire is one, I understand, is being resolved in accordance with NRW guidance and requirements and that work should be completed in the coming weeks.” Gething’s sole rival in the leadership race, Jeremy Miles, refused to be drawn into the row, saying only: “Donations to Vaughan’s campaign are a matter for him. My manifesto makes it clear I will have the most stringent environmental regulations.” Lee Waters, a Labour Senedd member and a supporter of Miles, said on X: “I’m sorry but £200k on an internal election in a cost of living crisis is completely unjustifiable. I don’t want this to become a negative campaign but I am genuinely shocked and angry by this. It’s wrong.”  I’m sorry but £200k on an internal election in a cost of living crisis is completely unjustifiable I don’t want this to become a negative campaign but I am genuinely shocked and angry by this. It’s wrong. https://t.co/IzMcJb6tFa— Lee Waters MS (@Amanwy) February 21, 2024  Other Labour party members and politicians have privately expressed concerns about the size of the donation and its origin. A former Welsh Labour minister, who did not want to be named, said: “At a time when Keir Starmer is calling out Tory sleaze, this looks like appalling judgment by Vaughan Gething.” A spokesperson for Gething’s campaign said: “Dauson Environmental Group Limited has donated to Vaughan Gething’s leadership campaign. All donations are declared to both the Senedd and the Electoral Commission in line with the rules and Vaughan’s commitment to transparency. “We are aware of the current issues relating to Withyhedge Landfill and, as with any such cases, would encourage that the issues be fully investigated and resolved as soon as possible. We have been in touch with the firm and been assured it is addressing the issues and is on course to meet NRW’s timetable. “Vaughan Gething’s leadership manifesto pledges to strengthen enforcement action to protect the environment and pledges stricter penalties for those who break environmental rules.” Electoral Commission records show that Miles has received £32,300 from three individuals and two businesses – a construction company and a translation and subtitling firm. The new Welsh Labour leader – and thus the new first minister – will be announced on Saturday 16 March."

        "content": "The speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is facing calls to resign over his handling of a vote by MPs on calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, which led to walkouts and claims of a stitch-up that favoured the Labour party.\nWhat was expected to have happened?\nMuch of the anger towards Hoyle comes from the Scottish National party (SNP), whose position as the third largest party in the Commons permits it to pick three opposition days every parliamentary session when it chooses the topic for debate.\nOn this occasion it had put forward a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, reflecting its long-term stance. This had placed particular pressure on Labour, whose leadership had been avoiding the explicit use of this wording.\nAmendments had been put forward by the government, which sought an “immediate humanitarian pause”, and by Labour, which had come up with carefully crafted wording backing a ceasefire but in language different to the SNP’s.\nAs many as 100 Labour MPs, including shadow cabinet ministers, had been expected to vote for the SNP motion in defiance of Keir Starmer, after the last ceasefire vote in November triggered the biggest rebellion of his tenure.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened instead?\nIn a breach of convention – which sparked concerns from none other than the clerk of the Commons – the speaker decided that MPs would first vote on Labour’s amendment before moving on to votes on the SNP’s original motion and the government proposal.\nLabour’s motion subsequently went through after the leader of the house, Penny Mordaunt, announced that the government would withdraw from voting.\n“Regrettably, Mr Speaker has inserted himself into the row and undermined the confidence of this house in being able to rely on its long-established standing orders to govern its debates,” she said.\nFrom a situation where Starmer had been facing the biggest crisis of his tenure as Labour leader, he emerged arguably as a stronger figure.\nWhy were these events such a problem?\nHoyle issued an apology late on Wednesday at the end of a chaotic six-hour debate, saying his decision “didn’t end up in the place that I wished”. Hoyle said he had been persuaded to allow both amendments because of threats to the personal safety of many MPs, who he believed should have been able to vote on a range of options.\nBut Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said the upshot was that SNP opposition day had turned into a Labour opposition day.\nConfidence in the speaker – a figure who is supposed to be an honest broker and who traditionally stands unopposed by the main parties when they seek election as an independent – is now crumbling amid claims he buckled under pressure from his old party, Labour.\nThe BBC’s Nick Watt reported that senior Labour figures had told him Hoyle had been “left in no doubt” Labour would bring him down as speaker after the general election if he did not select the party’s motion.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIs this the end of the road for Hoyle?\nWhile Conservative sources have not ruled out standing a candidate against Hoyle at the general election, the most immediate threat to him comes from an early day motion tabled by the Conservative backbencher William Wragg.\nThe single-sentence motion, stating that “this house has no confidence in Mr Speaker”, had been signed by 57 Conservative and SNP MPs before noon on Thursday.\nThe government has been staying out of it, at least for now, but the attitude of Conservative whips towards the motion will be key.\nOff the record, one minister said that while there was “much upset” with Hoyle, they did not believe he faced an existential threat. That may yet change.\nWhat happens next?\nMeetings were due to take place between Hoyle, party leaders and whips as he sought to rebuild confidence.\nThe motion of no confidence in Hoyle continues to collect signatures and could present a significant challenge to him if it reaches 100 by the end of Thursday.\nIt would be a dramatic step for the government to authorise a heave against Hoyle, particularly as Labour continues to support him. But it may also suit Rishi Sunak to sit above the fray and tacitly allow backbench Conservative MPs to vent their frustration for a few days on someone other than him.\nExpect Hoyle also to come in for a kicking in the Conservative-supporting press over the coming days. While he may weather this crisis, the coming months may prove to be wearing for the speaker as he limps on towards the general election."

        "content": "A government minister has said she will “struggle now to support” the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and his position is “difficult” as he faces a mounting challenge from MPs.\nSome Conservative and Scottish National party MPs have called for Hoyle to resign after he broke precedent to take a decision that ultimately benefited the Labour party on Wednesday night.\nBy Thursday morning at least 59 MPs had put their names to a motion expressing no confidence in Hoyle.\nThe Commons descended into chaos after Hoyle decided to allow votes on three separate propositions submitted by the SNP, Labour and the Conservatives on the war in Gaza.\nDozens of Labour MPs had been preparing to rebel against their party whip and vote for an SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. Hoyle’s decision to allow a vote on the Labour amendment, which called for a ceasefire with caveats, averted a rebellion and took the pressure off Keir Starmer.\nThe health minister Maria Caulfield told Sky News she was “disappointed and surprised” by Hoyle’s actions but refrained from calling for his resignation. “He’s normally a very fair speaker and his actions yesterday were very, very different,” she said.\n“I would say that I would struggle now to support him but let’s see what happens in the next 24 to 48 hours.”\nHoyle apologised on Wednesday after a breakdown of discipline in the Commons, with Tory and SNP MPs storming out, and resolved to have talks with party leaders on Thursday.\nAmid shouts of “resign”, he told MPs: “I thought I was doing the right thing and the best thing, and I regret it, and I apologise for how it’s ended up.” He said he had been “very, very concerned about the security of all members”.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBut his actions went against the advice of his clerk, who warned that it was a “departure from the long-established convention”. \nCaulfield told Sky: “We need to be absolutely sure that the votes weren’t influenced last night in any way … It has got implications going forward if we can’t be sure that the House of Commons can be run fairly.”\nSeparately she told LBC that Hoyle “went against the advice of the clerks of the house” and “that is a bit of a red line”.\nTories have claimed that Hoyle came under heavy pressure from Starmer and there were reports that Labour threatened to oust him as speaker after the next election unless he complied. Labour has vehemently denied this.\nLabour’s Pat McFadden, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, defended Hoyle and said he had “acted in good faith”.\nMcFadden told Radio 4’s Today programme that Hoyle “took the view that, given the strong feelings in the country on this issue, that he would put before parliament all three propositions that had been advanced on this – one from the SNP and one from the Labour party and one from the government.\n“He took that decision to have the widest possible set of options before parliament.”\nThe Tories withdrew from the vote on Wednesday night, with the Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt, saying that Hoyle had “hijacked” the debate and “undermined the confidence” of the house. There have been claims that the government whips did not have enough support for their motion.\nSpeaking on BBC Newsnight, the SNP’s culture spokesperson, John Nicolson, denied that the group had purposefully walked out of the chamber together with Tory MPs on Wednesday.\nNicolson said: “SNP MPs thought the whole procedure was absurd. What SNP MPs did was they went to the lobby, that’s the rooms beside the main parliamentary debating chamber, ready to vote, they were anticipating and expecting a vote.”\n“A number of MPs cross-party said they wanted their constituents to know where they stood on this and the problem with staged shenanigans was that MPs weren’t allowed to express their views in the lobbies and vote.”\nOther MPs have told the Guardian that they went into the aye lobby to make the point that they weren’t getting the chance to vote on their original motion. On Thursday morning Westminster group sources say MPs feel frustrated and angry that the focus has now moved so far from Gaza and at the way Westminster conventions can be broken “when it suits”. "

(See 9.21am.)\nMunby, who is now permanent secretary at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, says that Staunton has placed the wrong interpretation on his memo about what was said and that she never suggested he should delay compensation payments. She says:\n\nIt is not true that I made any instruction, either explicitly or implicitly, to Mr Staunton to in any way delay compensation payments. I did not. Neither Mr Staunton’s note, nor the contemporaneous note that my office made, suggest otherwise. In fact, no mention of delaying compensation appears in either note. I have attached both notes to this letter. I note that Mr Staunton originally said that there had been a direct instruction. Since he located the file note this seems to have moved to a suggestion of some sort of implied instruction. Such a claim is also not in any way supported by the notes and did not take place. \nAs the notes record, we discussed Post Office operational funding, not compensation funding. These two areas of spend were separately ringfenced, and it is factually wrong to suggest that cuts to compensation would have improved the Post Office’s financial position. The two notes do not indicate I made an implied suggestion that delays should be made, or that Mr Staunton understood me to be making one.\n\nThe department says the new memo refutes the claims made by Staunton about the conversation. A government spokesperson said:\n\nSarah Munby’s letter sets the record straight on her exchange with Mr Staunton.\nNeither of the records taken at the time suggest the government – either at official or ministerial level – wanted to slow down or delay compensation payments to postmasters, as the secretary of state said on Monday.\nFunding for compensation is separately ringfenced expenditure, and is not accessible to the Post Office for any purpose other than compensation payments.\nThis is a distraction from the important work to continue to deliver for postmasters, which the Business Secretary is focused on.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.51pm GMT\n\n\n 5.33pm GMT \n\nThe SNP will sign the early day motion tabled by the Conservative MP William Wragg expressing no confidence in the speaker, Kieran Andrews from the Times reports.\n\n\nSNP MPs will back Conservative MP William Wragg's early day motion of no confidence in speaker Lindsay Hoyle, source says— Kieran Andrews (@KieranPAndrews) February 21, 2024\n\n\nAn early day motion on its own has no impact. MPs tabled them all the time, but they don’t get debated and so, by itself, an EDM expressing no confidence in the speaker doesn’t matter. Both of Sir Lindsay Hoyle’s predecessors, John Bercow and Michael Martin, had EDMs tabled against them.\nOnly five Tories signed the anti-Bercow one, and he stood down at a time of his own choosing.\nBut Martin was forced out. That was not a direct result of the fact that 23 MPs had signed an EDM saying he should go. But those signatures were evidence of fact that Martin was losing the confidence of many MPs, because of his cack-handed response to the expenses scandal, and the EDM prompted David Cameron to hint that the opposition might schedule a vote on Martin’s future. What finally persuaded Martin to resign was when Gordon Brown, then PM, let him know the government no longer thought he should stay.\n\n\n\n 5.20pm GMT \n\nAs PA Media reports, the Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan recalled in the debate meeting humanitarian workers who had worked on the ground in Gaza, saying: “It was truly obvious to me that there has not been adequate protection of civilians, as it is obvious to all of us.”\nShe described accounts of the suffering, including descriptions of children under five “talking of wanting to take their own lives because they have watched their siblings hanging from buildings, dead; they have watched their parents exsanguinating in front of them, and are now left alone to face this world”. She went on: \n\nYes we need a peace process, yes the hostages must be freed, yes the wheels of international humanitarian law must turn, and yes, the Palestinian people must have a recognised state, but first, today, this minute, now, we must have an immediate ceasefire to save tens of thousands of lives.\nToday, let us say clearly that an immediate ceasefire must come, justice must be done, and peace must be won.\n\n\n\n\n 5.09pm GMT \n\nMark Logan, the Conservative MP for Bolton North East, used his speech in the debate a few minutes ago, to say that he was now going to say in public what he has been saying in private. He said:\n\nI want, my constituents want, and Gaza needs, an immediate ceasefire.\nIt’s not a sustainable ceasefire, it’s not a long-lasting ceasefire, which is basically just sustainably by other means …. With 28,000 now dead in Gaza, 11,500 children, playing around with words is just playing around with people’s lives.\nIsrael has gone too far. It’s disproportionate. It’s not gone too far just today. It’s gone too far already for months.\nAnd I’m concerned about Rafah, because time and time again we have heard about innocent people’s lives in Gaza. Time and time again we have reached the figure of 30,000 [deaths]. How can we have any trust that the 1.5 million people in Rafah will also be left untouched?\n\nLogan also criticised fellow Tories arguing that a vote for a ceasefire would just be symbolic. He said:\n\nMembers on my own side of the house have talked about how this is merely symbolic or it is virtue signalling, but at the end of the day we are MPs not to fix potholes, we are MPs not to follow up with our next door neighbour ‘the hedge has grown into my garden’. That is not what we are here for. We are here to protect lives, and this is the opportunity today to call for an immediate ceasefire.\nYes, it may just be signalling to an extent, but that signal has to be given to what we see as one of our close allies, Israel, in the region.\nThat has to happen today because in times gone by, with the United States back 20 years ago with Iraq, we thought we were doing the ‘good friend thing’ to go along with the United States. No, the better friend says no, this must stop now, this must stop today.\nSo a ceasefire must happen now, and so I no longer in good conscience can continue on backing in public the line that we have taken on this side of the house, regrettably.\n\nAlthough all the focus media focus has been on splits in the Labour party over Gaza, it is worth remembering that there are Conservative rebels on this topic too.\n\nUpdated at 5.35pm GMT\n\n\n 4.44pm GMT \n\nMore on the Tory backlash against Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker.

He said:\n\nThere is a very real danger that our emerging position, and certainly that of other parties, will leave Hamas’ terrorist organisation partially intact. That is an intolerable situation for Israel, it sends a very clear message that using human shields works, and we will not allow Israel to fully defend itself.\n\nMhairi Black, the SNP’s deputy leader at Westminster, claimed that MPs who did not vote for a ceasefire would be complicit in the killing of civilians in Gaza. She said:\n\nGiven the International Court of Justice has found there’s a plausible risk that Israel is committing genocide, it is upon the UK to revoke all arms licences and military equipment to Israel, otherwise we break our own treaties we’ve signed up to.\nThe least we can do is call for a ceasefire, because if we don’t we will be morally and directly complicit in every single life lost and every single family destroyed in Gaza.\n\nThe Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said a ceasefire was needed – whatever it was called. She said:\n\nI believe sincerely that this house is moving towards a right decision … Can we please try and send a message to the Palestinian people perishing in their tens of thousands on the ground, and to those hostage families, that fundamentally we need this to stop now and I don’t care what we call it.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the Conservative former chair of the defence committee, said parliament should have been able to unite behind a singe motion. He said:\n\nI very much welcome this debate on supporting a ceasefire in Gaza and the steps required to get us there, but let me be clear – as the nation and beyond watches on, it’s been a very sad day for parliament.\nRather than offer clarity on parliament’s position, speaking with one voice as we seek to end the fighting, there are not one but three separate motions as this debate turns into a political football.\nShame on us for failing to find common ground. What a wasted opportunity to exhibit UK leadership and resolve in seeking to get closer to the very objective that we came here to debate.\n\nSir Michael Ellis, the Conservative former attorney general, said the SNP motion could help Hamas. He said:\n\nIsrael has been through multiple rounds of conflict, initiated by the genocidal Hamas terror groups in Gaza and this motion – should it achieve its objective – would cement the prospects of many more such incursions or attacks in the future, and that is of course exactly what Hamas wants, to secure endless opportunities to destroy Israel granted by the confused logic of that motion.\n\nBut his fellow Conservative, Rehman Chishti, said he would back any motion proposing an immediate ceasefire. He said:\n\nI will be voting for motions which call for immediate humanitarian ceasefire, or which call for immediate ceasefire, because the time has come, if not now then when?\n\n\n\n\n 4.19pm GMT \n\nYou might expect Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Tory traditionalist and a former leader of the Commons, to be among those Conservatives criticising the speaker for his decision to allow a vote on the Labour amendment today. But, as Jon Craig from Sky reports, he isn’t. \n\nFormer Commons Leader Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg tells me that unlike many Tory MPs he supports Sir Lindsay Hoyle’s ruling selecting Labour & govt amendments.

Some commentators believe that the events in the chamber this afternoon show the opposite.

He said:\n\nI think there is more cohesion in this house today than we’re actually showing the public.\nThere are still some people in this house though who are demanding that a ceasefire has to be permanent.\nI don’t like making the comparison to our own peace process but the basic principles are the same: you cannot guarantee the permanence of a ceasefire. You should work for a ceasefire and you work to make it permanent, so the bar is too high for some people.\n\nLammy replied: \n\nThe honourable gentleman reminds this House of the seriousness of the issue before us, he reminds us not just of the ceasefire but the long yards and roads to peace.\n\n\n\n\n 2.57pm GMT \n\nThis is from my colleague Libby Brooks on why Gaza has become such a key issue in the contest between the SNP and Labour in Scotland.\n\n Related: Stakes are high as SNP and Labour wrestle over Gaza ceasefire call \n\nAnd here is an extract.\n\nAs [Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster], writing for Guardian Opinion on Wednesday morning, says: “No one is pretending that one vote at Westminster will magically result in a ceasefire overnight. But a ceasefire is more likely to happen if the UK parliament and government join international pressure.”\nThe party says this is entirely consistent with the position it has taken from those early days after the Hamas attacks – unlike Labour and the UK government. They believe that voters have appreciated the leadership [Humza] Yousaf has shown – he has garnered praise from some of his most ardent critics for what they have described as his dignity and moral courage.\nBut in an election year as high stakes as this for the SNP, with Scottish Labour toe to toe in the polls, this motion could have significance well beyond the machinations of Commons process.\nIn his first campaign speech of the new year, Yousaf insisted that Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland” to win the general election, arguing that voting in more SNP MPs would “keep him honest”, and offering to “work constructively” with a Labour government to prevent backsliding on green investment or the creeping privatisation of the NHS. Regardless of the outcome of this afternoon’s vote, the SNP will use it to strengthen that argument.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.13pm GMT\n\n\n 2.42pm GMT \n\nJeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, intervenes.

He says Israel should reflect on whether an offensive would be in their long-term interests.\n\n\n\n 2.34pm GMT \n\nAndrew Mitchell, the development minister, is speaking now on behalf of the government. He says David Lammy urged MPs to come together, and he says the best way for this to happen would be for the the Commons to support the government.\nHe says the government intends to move its amendment (implying it will vote against Labour’s, although he does not say that explicitly.)\nHere is the text of the government one. It says the house:\n\nsupports Israel’s right to self-defence, in compliance with international humanitarian law, against the terror attacks perpetrated by Hamas; condemns the slaughter, abuse and gender-based violence perpetrated on 7 October 2023; further condemns the use of civilian areas by Hamas and others for terrorist operations; urges negotiations to agree an immediate humanitarian pause as the best way to stop the fighting and to get aid in and hostages out; supports moves towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire; acknowledges that achieving this will require all hostages to be released, the formation of a new Palestinian Government, Hamas to be unable to launch further attacks and to be no longer in charge in Gaza, and a credible pathway to a two-state solution which delivers peace, security and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians; expresses concern at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and at the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah; reaffirms the urgent need to significantly scale up the flow of aid into Gaza, where too many innocent civilians have died; and calls on all parties to take immediate steps to stop the fighting and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.\n\nHe says the Commons as a whole should support this.\n\n\n\n 2.29pm GMT \nLammy says MPs used to division 'because our trade is politics', but urges them to rise above it on Gaza\n\nLammy says MPs are used to division, because their trade relies upon it.\nBut he says, on this, MPs should rise above it.\nHe urges the Commons to come together for the sake of peace.\nUPDATE: Lammy ended his speech saying:\n\nThe UK cannot advance this agenda on its own, but it can’t also sit this one out.\nIt is time for international community to stand up, achieve an end to the fighting and a path to peace, and the UK must play its part.\nThat’s why our amendment makes it explicit that we will not give up on a two-state solution, it makes it clear that we will work with international partners to recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to, rather than an outcome to, a two-state solution.\nIn this house we are used to division because our trade is politics, but on this matter we must rise above it.\nA united parliament today can show we’re rolling up our sleeves, committing to the long, hard road to peace so that we will have made the voice of our nation heard, to influence this war, to help these tragic children of the same land to find peace in the beautiful Palestine of tomorrow and in Israel without tears, where the stones of Jerusalem shall finally be a city of peace.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.51pm GMT\n\n\n 2.27pm GMT \n\nLammy says the Labour amendment makes it explicit that the party would not give up a on a two-state solution.\n\n\n\n 2.26pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons the SNP’s Dave Doogan intervenes and says Labour had had its own opposition day debate recently.

He said:\n\nNo one would deny that Israel has the right to defend itself. Every country has that right.\nWhat no country has the right to do, however, is to lay siege to a civilian population, carpet bomb densely inhabited areas, drive people from their homes, erase an entire civilian infrastructure, and impose a collective punishment involving the cutting off of water, electricity, food and medicine, from civilians.\nAnd no country, regardless of who they are, in the name of self-defence can kill civilians at such a pace and on such a scale that in just 16 weeks almost 30,000 are known to have died, with a further 80,000 injured.\nWe cannot allow the core principle of self-defence to be so ruthlessly exploited and manipulated in order to legitimise the slaughter of innocent civilians.\n\nO’Hara said the international rule-based order was “created to protect people from atrocities, not to be used as a smokescreen to hide the execution of them”, adding: “We cannot accept that what is happening now is self-defence.”\n\n\n\n 2.05pm GMT \n\nAn earlier post (see 1.43pm) said the Labour motion was likely to pass. I have removed that line from it now because, looking closely at what Sir Lindsay Hoyle said (see 1.54pm), it is clear that the government motion will only be put to a vote if the Labour one has been voted down. That means the government has a clear incentive to vote against Labour’s wording.\nAlso, if the government can knock out the Labour amendment, that would lead to a vote on the original SNP motion – which will trigger a Labour revolt (because some MPs would support it).

I have therefore decided to select the amendments both in the name of the prime minister and in the name of the leader of the opposition, because the operation of standing order 31 will prevent another amendment being moved after the government has moved its amendment.\nI will exceptionally call the opposition frontbench spokesperson to move their amendment at the beginning of the debate.\nAt the end of the debate the house will have an opportunity to take a decision on the official opposition amendment.\nIf that is agreed to, there is a final question on the main motion as amended [which would be the Labour text].\nIf the official opposition amended is not agreed to, I will call the minister to move the government amendment forward. That will engage the provisions of standing order 31, so the next vote would be on the original words in the SNP motion.\nIf that is not agreed to, then the house will have the opportunity to vote on the government amendment.\nProceeding this way will allow a vote to take place potentially on all proposals from each of the three main parties.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.03pm GMT\n\n\n 1.44pm GMT \n\nChristopher Hope from GB News says No 10 is not happy about the speaker’s ruling.\n\nFigures in Number 10 are upset about speaker Lyndsay Hoyle selecting Labour’s Opposition Day debate amendment on the Gaza ceasefire.One tells me “it’s without precedent”.

Asked how the government could offer such assurances given the last test in 2016 also resulted in a misfire, the spokesperson said: “There really isn’t much more I can add on the technical issues. The purpose of this operation was a full two-month period of exercises which successfully validated the submarine and the crew. There was this specific anomaly but we are confident that the anomaly was specific to the test and that there are no wider implications.”\nAsked when the last successful Trident missile test was, the spokesperson said: “I can’t provide any more commentary on matters of national security.”\nHe said he would not comment on whether Mr Sunak wanted to see a follow-up test after last month’s failed attempt.\n\n\n\n\n 1.20pm GMT \n\nNicholas Watt from Newsnight suggests Labour MPs are spinning out proceedings in the chamber for a reason; they are still trying to get the speaker to agree to their party’s amendment on Gaza.\n\n\nNegotiations with @CommonsSpeaker on Labour Gaza amendment taking time, according to one senior source familiar with discussions, because advice from clerks is clear: precedent would suggest calling SNP motion and government amendment.

They believe it will break with precedent\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm GMT \n\nWe will have to wait another 15 mintues for the speaker’s decision on amendments to the Gaza motion. There has been a ten-minute rule motion first, on a bill proposed by Thérèse Coffey to do with driving regulations and Labour’s Chris Bryant have just finished a speech saying he opposes it. He has called for a vote.\nNormally MPs don’t vote on 10-minute rule bill motions because there is no point. They don’t become law. \nIt does feel as if MPs are playing for time, for some reasons. There were numerous points of order after PMQs, which is unusual, and now we’ve got a vote. Maybe something’s up.\n\n\n\n 1.10pm GMT \n\nThe SNP was due to have debates on two motions it has tabled today – on Gaza, and on the proposal for a £28bn a year green investment programme – but it has abandoned the second debate, Dan Bloom from Politico reports.\n\n\nI’ve heard the SNP has now dropped plans to debate Gaza *and* Labour’s £28bn this afternoon, meaning it can devote the full 6-ish hours to Gaza with votes around 7pm.— Dan Bloom (@danbloom1) February 21, 2024\n\n\nThis means the voting on the Gaza bill won’t start until 7pm.\n\n\n\n 1.05pm GMT \nPMQs - snap verdict\n\nSome of the pre-PMQs commentary suggested that we were in for particularly lively exchanges this afternoon. During recess last week, the UK went into recession, the Tories lost two safe seats in byelections, and Keir Starmer had to abandon another byelection candidate. Both leaders had plenty of material to hand with which they could taunt each other.\nBut instead we got a much more narrowly focused exchange, covering the Post Office Horizon scandal and Kemi Badenoch’s provocative response to allegations made against the government by Henry Staunton, the Post Office chair she sacked. Starmer’s script was more restrained, and less rhetorical or condemnatory, than usual, but it was effective nonetheless, because he sought to establish whether Sunak was willing to give an unequivocal defence of what Badenoch has been saying in the row, and it turned out he wasn’t. Sunak did not quite cut her loose. But he said about the bare minimum necessary to defend her without his lack of enthusiasm becoming too obvious.\nBadenoch is favourite to be the next Tory leader after the next election and she probably does not care very much what Sunak thinks about her. But, as the subsequent exchanges made clear (see 12.33pm, 12.45pm and 12.48pm), she is collecting enemies at an extraordinary rate. This does not seem to worry those Tories who admire here, but at some point they may start to wonder whether this is a positive trait in a party leader.\n\n\n\n 12.50pm GMT \n\nBob Blackman (Con) says when Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected speaker, he said that when he made controversial decisions, he would publish the advice he had been given by clerks. Will he do it this afternoon in relation to the selection of amendments on the Gaza motion.\nWinterton says the speaker will have heard this point.\n\n\n\n 12.48pm GMT \n\nLiam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business committee, raises another point of order. He asks about Canada saying Badenoch was wrong to say trade talks with the UK were still happening. (See 9.21am.) How can MPs find out if these talks are happening, or just going on “in the business secretary’s mind”.\nWinterton says she cannot speak for the minister, but Byrne will have other opportunities to pursue this, she says.\n\n\n\n 12.45pm GMT \n\nLucy Powell, the shadow leader of the Commons, raises a point of order. She asks what MPs can do to get clarification from Kemi Badenoch over why her comments to the house on Monday about the Post Office dispute were misleading.\nDame Rosie Winterton, the deputy speaker, says this is not a matter for her, but the government will have heard the point.\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.44pm GMT \n\nGraham Stringer (Lab) asks if Sunak realised, when he cancelled phase 2 of HS2, that trains to Manchester would end up going more slowly as a result because they would have to use unsuitable track.\nSunak ignores the point, but says that all the money saved from the HS2 cancellation will stay in the north, and that says that Labour does not have a position on HS2 phase 2.\n\nUpdated at 12.45pm GMT\n\n\n 12.40pm GMT \n\nChris Elmore (Lab) accuses Sunak of failing to protect steel jobs in south Wales.\nSunak says the government has worked hard to secure a long-term, sustainable solution for the steel industry in south Wales.

Will that happen?\nSunak confirms that that is the plan. He says two road plans Butler has been campaigning for should benefit.\n\n\n\n 12.16pm GMT \n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, echoes what Sunak and Starmer said about the “heroic bravery” of Alexei Navalny.\nHe says 60% of buildings in Gaza are damaged. What the Israelis have done does not amount to self-defence, he says.\nSunak says the government has called for an immediate humanitarian pause. That is what he impressed on the Israeli PM last week when they spoke.\nFlynn says the Commons should send a clear and united message that it backs an immediate ceasefire.\nSunak says of course he wants to see the fighting end, and to never again allow the attacks carried out by Hamas. But if there were a ceasefire now, it would collapse within weeks, he suggests. He says a ceasefire should be sustainable.\n\n\n\n 12.12pm GMT \n\nStarmer turns to the infected blood scandal, and asks what undertaking Sunak has made to ensure that the government is not “limping towards the election” delaying payments for this group.\nSunak says he gave evidence to this inquiry. He knows that thousands of people have suffered. This is an incredibly complicated issue, he says. The Cabinet Office is appointing experts so that it can make informed decisions to the inquiry’s recommendations on compensation when they are published. The government will respond within 25 days, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.10pm GMT \n\nStarmer refers to an postmaster waiting for justice. He asks if the government will publish all the relevant paperwork to this case.\nSunak says Starmer never raised the Post Office scandal with him previously. He says the inquiry is the proper place for this to be investigated. In the meantime, the government is paying compensation, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.09pm GMT \n\nStarmer asks Sunak if he has asked government colleagues about what they knew about the Post Office scandal in 2016.\nSunak says the government set up an inquiry. That is the right approach, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.08pm GMT \n\nStarmer asks about the BBC report this week suggesting the government knew there was a cover up in the Post Office in 2016.\nSunak says the government set up an inquiry.\nUPDATE: Starmer said:\n\nI do hope the prime minister will instigate that investigation into what was said on Monday because one of the features of this miscarriage is that where concerns have been raised they have been pushed to one side.\nThis week we also learned that a 2016 investigation into whether Post Office branch accounts could be altered was suddenly stopped before it was completed …\nWhat did government ministers know about it at the time?\n\nAnd Sunak replied:\n\n[Starmer] has picked one particular date. But it is worth bearing in mind that this scandal … has unfolded over decades.\nAnd it was actually following a landmark 2019 high court case that the previous government established a statutory inquiry …. which is uncovering exactly what went wrong. And it is right that that inquiry is allowed to do its work.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.38pm GMT\n\n\n 12.07pm GMT \nSunak resists Starmer's call for investigation into row between Badenoch and Staunton over Horizon compensation payment instructions\n\nStarmer says new evidence today appears to endorse Staunton’s claim. He asks if Sunak will order an investigation into what happened.\nSunak focuses on the victims, saying they are being paid compensation, and that an inquiry is under way.\nHe says he will make sure “the truth comes to light”. But he seems to be referring to the inquiry process, not to the truth about the Badenoch/Staunton row.\nUPDATE: Starmer said:\n\nOn Monday the business secretary also confirmed categorically that the Post Office was, and I’ll quote this in fairness to the Prime Minister, ‘at no point told to delay compensation payments by either an official or a minister from any government department, and at no point was it suggested that a delay would be of benefit to the Treasury’, so that’s Monday.\nA note released by the former Post Office chair this morning appears to directly contradict that … I appreciate the business secretary has put the prime minister in a tricky position, but will he commit to investigating this matter properly? Including whether that categorical statement was correct, and why rather than taking those accusation seriously she accused a whistleblower of lying?\n\nAnd Sunak replied:\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind as the business secretary said on Monday, she asked Henry Staunton to step down after serious concerns were raised.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.34pm GMT\n\n\n 12.05pm GMT \nSunak refuses to endorse Badenoch's claim that ex-Post Office chair was lying about conversation about compensation payments\n\nKeir Starmer starts by welcoming the new Labour MPs for Wellingborough and Kingswood.\nAnd he also pays tribute to Alexei Navalny.\nHe asks Sunak if he will repeat the claim made by Kemi Badenoch, that Henry Staunton was “lying’” when he said he was told to go slow on paying compensation.\nSunak says the government has taken unprecedented steps to make sure victims get compensation.\nUPDATE: Starmer said:\n\nWould the prime minister be prepared personally to repeat the allegations made by his business secretary, that the former chair of the Post Office is lying when he says he was told to go slow on compensation for postmasters and limp to the next election?\n\nAnd Sunak replied:\n\nAs the business secretary said on Monday, she asked Henry Staunton to step down after serious concerns were raised, she set out the reasons for this and the full background in the house earlier this week, but importantly we have also taken unprecedented steps to ensure that victims of the Horizon scandal do receive compensation as swiftly as possible and in full.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.27pm GMT\n\n\n 12.01pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak starts by sending his condolences to the family of Alexei Navalny.

Yesterday Labour tabled its own, longer amendment, calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, and then the government tabled its version, calling for an “immediate humanitarian pause”.\nYou can read the SNP motion, the Labour and government amendments, and a Lib Dem amendment, on the Commons order paper.\nThe Labour amendment was welcomed by MPs in the party who rebelled in November last year, when Keir Starmer ordered his MPs not to vote for an SNP ceasefire amendment, and it was welcomed by the SNP. It was also more or less in line with the government’s position on Gaza (but more the David Cameron government stance than the Rish Sunak one – there are differences of emphasis).\nBut it looks likely that the Labour amendment won’t be put to a vote. That is because the rules say, with opposition day debates like this, if there is a government amendment, MPs vote first on the opposition motion, and then on the government amendment. Daniel Gover, an academic specialising in parliamentary procedure, has given the best explanation of why in a thread on X.\n\n\nCommons procedure on opposition days is different to usual. This makes selection of amdts especially tricky.If Speaker selects Labour amendment, SNP almost certainly denied chance to vote on own motion.If selects govt amendment, Labour very likely can't vote on theirs.🧵— Daniel Gover (@DanielGover) February 21, 2024\n\n\n\nCommons procedure on opposition days is different to usual.

This does occasionally happen, but it’s a little harsh given limited opposition time (esp for smaller parties like SNP).\n\n\nSelecting the government motion, however, is likely to mean that Labour cannot vote on its amendment.\nThe standing order above states that, once a government amendment (meeting certain criteria) has been moved, the order is: (a) main question, and if rejected (b) govt amdt.\n\n\n\nIn the past, this has been interpreted as meaning that, if a government amendment is moved, 'it is not possible for a second amendment... to be put'.This was from 2015, when a Labour backbencher attempted to amend a Labour opposition day motion. pic.twitter.com/HVSfK6yaPG— Daniel Gover (@DanielGover) February 21, 2024\n\n\n\nIn the past, this has been interpreted as meaning that, if a government amendment is moved, ‘it is not possible for a second amendment... to be put’.\nThis was from 2015, when a Labour backbencher attempted to amend a Labour opposition day motion.\n\n\nMy main doubt is whether something could be done to schedule when amendments are ‘moved’, and thus avoid these provisions.

Today Labour has got more than 140 of its MPs to sign the amendment, making the point to the speaker that there is strong demand in the house for a vote on this.\nKate Ferguson from the Sun on Sunday she has been told the speaker is considering whether he can allow votes on both the Labour and the government motion.\n\n\nRumours the Speaker is looking at changing standing orders so he can call Labour amendment as well as the government amendment on todays Palestine ceasefire vote— Kate Ferguson (@kateferguson4) February 21, 2024\n\n\n\nRumours the Speaker is looking at changing standing orders so he can call Labour amendment as well as the government amendment on todays Palestine ceasefire vote\n\nIf there is a vote on the Labour motion, the government may decide not to put its own motion to a vote.

PA says:\n\nA spokesman for the former prime minister dismissed as “untrue” accusations levelled at him by Carlson in an extended attack during an appearance on right-wing news channel Blaze TV.\nThe US presenter said he had been “annoyed” after Johnson denounced him as a Kremlin stooge following his interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHe claimed he asked the former Tory MP for a talk and a member of Johnson’s team said “it’s going to cost you $1m” and “then he will explain his position on Ukraine”.\nCarlson denied supporting Putin’s regime, but added: “I’m not defending Putin, but Putin didn’t ask for one million dollars… This whole thing is a freaking shakedown.”\nHe said: “If you’re making money money off a war, you know, you can deal with God on that, because that’s really immoral.”\nA spokesman for Johnson said: “This account is untrue.”\nThe former prime minister’s team said Carlson, an influential voice in right-wing US media known for having launched scathing attacks against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had offered one million dollars for an interview on his channel.\nJohnson initially accepted, provided the money went solely to Ukrainian veteran charities, but decided not to go ahead with it after the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, which has been widely blamed on the Kremlin, they said.\nIt is the latest flare-up in a row between the pair after Johnson used his Daily Mail column to brand Mr Carlson “a traitor to journalism” for his interview with the Russian President.\nJohnson said the presenter had betrayed “viewers and listeners around the world” for not taking Putin to task for “the torture, the rapes, the blowing up of kindergartens” in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n 10.33am GMT \nTories, Labour and Lib Dems make their case to NFU conference\n\nMark Spencer, the Conservative farming minister, his opposite number Dan Zeichner and Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron have been setting out their stalls to farmers at the NFU conference.\nSpencer mostly blamed the issues farmers have faced in recent years on the Ukraine war, rising inflation and extreme weather. Many farmers at the NFU conference have spoken of their heartbreak as their farms have been underwater for months. Spencer promised he would incentivise farmers to keep producing British meat, saying “lots of people try to frame this sector as the [environmental] problem” but that “we are the people who can deliver a lower carbon footprint and less methane by producing the great quality of meat we produce”.\nHe gave a swipe to Labour, who have sparked protests in Wales over their diktat to farmers making them put 10% of their land into habitat schemes and plant 10% more with trees.\nZeichner took a more mild mannered approach and promised Labour would stop trade deal with countries which undercut the standards of British farmers, as well as ending the checking hold-ups at Dover. He reiterated Labour promises to lower energy costs and reduce rural crime, as well as setting up a Cobra-style taskforce to tackle floods.\nHe said: \n\nJacob Rees Mogg’s comments welcoming hormone injected beef and chlorine-washed chicken were rightly called out by Minette [Batters, the NFU president], but they represent a strand of thinking that runs deep through parts of the Conservative party, parts that were in government all too recently, and could be again.\n\nFarron slammed the Tories’ “botched transition” and said hill farmers in his constituency have been losing 41% of their income under the new environment schemes. He said the “lakeland clearances” have been going on, by which he means large landlords are turfing tenant farmers off the hills to enter into lucrative government nature schemes. \nFarron also highlighted a Guardian story about how Defra officials have buried evidence showing the dire situaiton for hill farmers and promised £1bn extra a year in farming schemes under a Lib Dem government.\nSpencer promised he would stop people “taking the mickey” by “taking action to stop” landowners turfing off tenants and planting large parts of their farm as wild bird food to receive payments of £800 an acre. However, this only appears to be in the form of “issuing very strong guidance”.\n\n\n\n 10.16am GMT \n\nVictoria Atkins, the health secretary, was on the media round this morning, mostly to publicise the news that “Martha’s rule” is being adopted in 100 English hospitals from April at the start of a national rollout. \n\n Related: ‘Martha’s rule’ granting urgent second opinion to be adopted in 100 English hospitals \n\nBut Atkins was also asked about the Henry Staunton memo published by the Times this morning. (See 9.21am.) In an interview with Times Radio it was put to Atkins that the memo showed Kemi Badenoch was wrong to dismiss Staunton as a liar. Atkins replied:\n\nFrom what I’ve seen in the papers, I would not say the note is as clear as that, but as I say, I can’t really be drawn into the detail of this. \nThe secretary of state set this out very, very clearly in the chamber.

Referring to the new evidence published by the Times today (see 9.21am), Cooper says:\n\nGiven that Mr Staunton continues to stand by his allegations, there is a clear question as to who is telling the truth and whether Kemi Badenoch has knowingly misled parliament. It is clearly in the public interest for the facts of this important matter to be determined. In your role as ethics adviser, I urge you to open an investigation into this matter and accordingly determine whether or not a breach of the code has been committed by the secretary of state.\nSubpostmasters who are at the heart of this whole scandal deserve justice, financial redress and the truth.\n\nNormally the ethics advisers (technically known as the independent adviser on ministers’ interests) only launches an inquiry into a minister at the request of the PM. And yesterday Rishi Sunak defended Badenoch’s response to the Staunton allegations.\nBut under revised terms of reference published two years ago, the adviser can initiate an investigation himself. If that happens, the PM has the right to veto it, but in those circumstances the adviser can insist on reasons for this being made public (unless there is a good reason for keeping that decision private, such as national security).\nUPDATE: Here is the text of Cooper’s letter.\n\n\nThe latest Post Office row raises new questions.If Kemi Badenoch misled Parliament then she breached the Ministerial Code, so @LibDems are calling for the Ethics Advisor to investigate.

After the former Post Office chair, Henry Staunton, gave an interview at the weekend making various allegations about the government’s response to the Horizon scandal, including claiming that he was told by a senior official to delay compensation payments, Kemi Badenoch, the businesss secretary, hit back. Whereas politicians in these circumstances normally only contest the parts of the negative story they can confidently refute, Badenoch went nuclear, and more or less dismissed everything Staunton was saying as a complete pack of lies.\nToday that is not looking like such a wise strategy. Henry Staunton has now found a copy of the contemporaneous note he made of his conversation with the person he described to the Sunday Times as a senior civil servant and he has shown it to the Times. The official was Sarah Munby, who at the time was permanent secretary at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and the memo does a lot to substantiate Staunton’s original claim.\nIn his story for the Times, Oliver Shah reports:\n\nStaunton’s first meeting with Munby came a month after he took over from Tim Parker in December 2022. His memo says that he told Munby that he “had been on over a dozen public company boards and not seen one with so many challenges”. It says that the board had identified a financial shortfall of £160 million as of September 2022 and that “there was a likelihood of a significant reduction in post offices if funding [from the government] was not [requested]”.\n“Sarah was sympathetic to all of the above,” the memo says. “She understood the ‘huge commercial challenge’ and the ‘seriousness’ of the financial position. She described ‘all the options as unattractive’. However, ‘politicians do not necessarily like to confront reality’. This particularly applied when there was no obvious ‘route to profitability’.\n“She said we needed to know that in the run-up to the election there was no appetite to ‘rip off the band aid’. ‘Now was not the time for dealing with long-term issues.’ We needed a plan to ‘hobble’ up to the election.”\n\nIn his interview at the weekend Staunton said he was told to hold up spending so the Post Office could “limp” into the election. In one respect his memory was faulty, because the word he recorded in his contemporaneous record was “hobble”. But that is a minor detail. On the substance of what was said, the written evidence backs up what was claimed in the interview.\nIn response, a government source has told the Times that Staunton is misrepresenting what he was told, either deliberately or because he was confused. Munby was not talking about compensation payments, the source suggested. They said:\n\nThe long-standing issues around Post Offices finances are a matter of public record and do not include postmaster compensation, which is being fully funded by the government. Henry Staunton is either confused or deliberately mixing up the two issues.\n\nOn the record, the government is also denying that Staunton was told to delay the payment of compensation. “The government has sped up compensation to victims, and consistently encouraged postmasters to come forward with their claims. To suggest any actions or conversations happened to the contrary is incorrect,” a spokesperson said.\nBut, although his memo implies Munby was talking about overall Post Office finances, Staunton told the Times that by far the two biggest items where the Post Office was able to vary its spending were compensation payments and replacement of the Horizon system.\nWhen it is hard to reconcile two conflicting accounts of a story, one reliable fallback is to consider which source is more reliable. And that is why it is particularly unfortunate for Badenoch that the new revelation coincides with the publication of a story in the Financial Times implying she has not been telling the truth about trade talks with Canada. In their story, George Parker, Lucy Fisher and Peter Campbell report:\n\nBadenoch told MPs “explicitly” on January 29 that talks with Canada were “ongoing” to avoid a March 31 tariff cliff-edge for UK carmakers, even though she had earlier unilaterally paused wider trade talks with the Ottawa government\nBut the Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Ralph Goodale, has written to the House of Commons business select committee to insist Badenoch’s claimed talks, which also cover cheesemakers, have not happened.\n\nWith PMQs starting within the next three hours, both stories are likely to get referenced later in the Commons today. And that is before we even get started on the Gaza debate.\nAnd at some point MPs will also want to address the story suggesting the UK no longer has a working nuclear deterrent. So it is going to be a busy day.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10am: Sir Mark Rowley, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, gives evidence to the London assembly’s police and crime committee.\n12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\nAfter 12.45pm: MPs begin their debate on the SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Voting should take place at around 4pm.\nAfternoon: The Palestine Solidarity Campaign holds a rally outside parliament.\nAlso, in Wales, junior doctors have started a three-day strike.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "The speaker of the House of Commons issued an unprecedented apology after a fractious and occasionally chaotic parliamentary debate on Gaza.\nMPs voted unanimously for a Labour motion calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza, but only after Lindsay Hoyle upended years of parliamentary precedent to allow the party to bring its motion to a vote.\nConservative and Scottish National party MPs reacted with fury to Hoyle’s decision, which the speaker said was designed to air a wide range of opinions but which also allowed the Labour leader to dodge the biggest rebellion of his leadership.\nSome are now trying to unseat Hoyle while others are urging the Conservatives to ignore common practice and stand against him at the general election.\nIn the end Labour’s amendment passed unopposed after Tory and SNP MPs walked out of the chamber. Starmer afterwards accused them of “choosing political games over serious solutions”. \n \n\n\n\n\n\nHoyle apologised to MPs at the end of a six-hour debate marked by parliamentary chicanery, frequent shouting across the Commons chamber and accusations of partisanship on the part of the speaker.\n\n Related: While people die in Gaza, the UK parliament goes to war over the ceasefire | John Crace \n\nIn an unexpected statement, the speaker told a packed chamber: “It is clear that today did not show the house at its best. I will reflect on my part in that of course.”\nHe added: “I have tried to do what I thought was the right thing for all sides of this House. It is regrettable, and I apologise, that the decision didn’t end up in the place that I wished.”\nThe apology came at the end of a dramatic day in Westminster which saw Starmer personally lobby the Commons speaker to allow his motion to come to a vote.\nLabour MPs had warned Starmer that up to 100 of them were ready to rebel against party orders and vote for a Scottish National party amendment calling for an immediate ceasefire unless Labour offered its own similar alternative. Sources have said that at least two shadow cabinet ministers were ready to resign over the issue.\nLabour announced on Tuesday it would push for an amendment calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, which it said could only happen under certain circumstances, such as if Hamas no longer threatened violence against Israel.\nThe wording of the Labour amendment was enough to persuade dozens of MPs to agree to vote for it instead of the SNP motion, which Labour has opposed on the grounds that it is not clear enough about the conditions necessary for a ceasefire.\nLabour MPs warned however that if they were denied the chance to vote for their own amendment they would vote for the SNP’s motion, in what would have amounted to the biggest direct challenge to Starmer’s leadership since he took over.\nWith hours to go before the vote, Hoyle had still not decided whether to call a proposed government amendment to the motion, the Labour one, or both. After a last-minute intervention from Starmer himself, the speaker decided to call both – a decision which was greeted with fury on the Conservative and SNP benches.\nHoyle said later he had been persuaded to allow both amendments because of threats to the personal safety of many MPs.\nSeveral Labour members who abstained on a similar SNP motion in November say they have since faced abuse and personal threats, and with hundreds of protesters gathered outside Westminster, Hoyle was persuaded to give them a route out.\nHe faced criticism however even from his own clerk Tom Goldsmith who wrote a letter explaining his view that the decision was “a departure from the long-established convention for dealing with such amendments”.\nThe Conservative MP William Wragg then tabled a parliamentary motion expressing no confidence in the speaker. By Wednesday evening, 33 MPs had signed Wragg’s motion, mostly from the SNP.\nAfter an often bitter Commons debate, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, announced the government would not participate in the votes, paving the way for the Labour amendment to pass unopposed.\nMordaunt launched a bitter attack on Hoyle as she announced her decision, saying he had “hijacked” the debate and “undermined the confidence of the Commons”.\nShe later accepted Hoyle’s apology, however, saying: “You’re our speaker, and we wish you to defend the rights of all members of this House.”\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader in Westminster, said: “We have seen the SNP opposition day turn into a Labour party opposition day, and I’m afraid that that is treating myself and my colleagues in the Scottish National party with complete and utter contempt. I will take significant convincing that your position is not now intolerable.”\nBut while Hoyle will continue facing the anger of many MPs, Labour officials believe his position is secure and that much of the government anger was being confected for effect. Some warned that the row over obscure parliamentary process during a debate about the war in Gaza risked undermining the reputation of the Commons in voters’ eyes.\nOne minister admitted: “We’re not as angry as we’re pretending.”"

        "content": "After his election as the Commons speaker on a promise of restoring calm after the rancorous final years of John Bercow, Sir Lindsay Hoyle finds himself facing the sort of bitter criticism once directed at his predecessor.\nOn Wednesday, amid shouts of “resign”, Hoyle issued an apology to MPs after the Commons chamber descended into chaos over his handling of a tense Gaza vote, which had prompted a walkout by SNP and Tory MPs.\n“I thought I was doing the right thing and the best thing, and I regret it, and I apologise for how it’s ended up,” he said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSuch was the anger at his selection of both government and Labour amendments to the Scottish National party’s Gaza ceasefire motion – a decision that defused the scale of rebellion facing Keir Starmer – the Conservatives are not ruling out running a candidate against him in his Chorley constituency at the next general election. Speakers are not traditionally challenged by the main parties at elections.\n“I do take responsibility for my actions, and that’s why I want to meet with the key players who have been involved,” said the speaker.\nHoyle said he wanted to meet with party leaders and chief whips to “discuss what is the best way forward”. To heckling, he also denied he had earlier met Sue Gray, Starmer’s chief of staff, amid Tory claims that he had wilted under Labour pressure.\nAlthough he was expected to avoid a government-backed heave against him in parliament, there was an explicit rebuke of him from the dispatch box by the leader of the Commons, Penny Mordaunt.\nAnnouncing that the government would withdraw from the votes on Gaza, Mordaunt said Hoyle had “raised temperatures” on an issue where feelings were already running high and had “put MPs in a more difficult position”.\nWhile Hoyle had justified his decision on the basis that it would give MPs the “widest possible range of options” on the “highly sensitive subject”, it departed from a convention where one opposition party cannot amend another’s motion.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Hoyle, the clerk of the House of Commons, Tom Goldsmith, said he felt “compelled to point out that long-established conventions” were not being followed in this case.\nIn scenes reminiscent of Bercow’s time in the speaker’s chair after the Brexit referendum, MPs repeatedly interrupted Hoyle.\nHe faced widespread heckling as he suggested the rules around opposition-led debates reflect an “outdated approach” that restricted the “operations” that could be put to the Commons. The former Tory minister Sir Desmond Swayne shouted “bring back Bercow!” while others shouted “shame”.\nOn a highly charged day, during which tensions rose inside and outside parliament, sources close to Hoyle said the personal safety and pressure that MPs and families had been under had weighed heavily on his belief that colleagues should be able to weigh up all options.\nThere was also a public call for calm by the Tory MP Sir Charles Walker. While there was “upset and concern” at the speaker’s decision, Walker said, he did not foresee the grievance turning into a sustained move to remove Hoyle.\nAsked about the level of anger in government, a minister told the Guardian that Wragg’s motion offered a way of venting anger but described it as “a parliamentary issue, not a government one”.\n“Colleagues are just embarrassed for [Hoyle] now after the immediate shock. It was he who had said in his manifesto that he would support the smaller parties yet just bulldozed them in favour of Keir’s need not to have frontbench resignations,” the minister added.\nEither way, Hoyle, an avuncular pet lover who was first elected as a Labour MP for Chorley in 1997, finds himself in the parliamentary crosshairs of others after a political career in which he was well regarded on both sides of the house.\nComing after Bercow, who was found to have bullied his staff in a parliamentary investigation and was widely criticised as being partisan, Hoyle vowed to transform a “toxic parliament”.\nThe son of a Labour MP, Hoyle ran a textile and screen-printing firm before entering parliament. A ministerial appointment never came, but he was a diligent committee member not without the political skills that paved the way for his elevation.\n“I’ve come into this job as a referee,” Hoyle said when appointed speaker, before adding: “It shouldn’t be about me, it’s about the chamber.”"

        "content": "Just when you hoped you’d reached rock bottom, parliament finds a way of going still lower. Westminster bows to no one in its efforts to let you and the country down. Luckily, it can’t let itself down. That would imply it had some primitive, protozoan conscience. Politicians who strive for dignity – who demand respect – prove themselves to be made of straw. Little men and women driven entirely by their own worst instincts.\nTake the conflict in Israel and Gaza. The murder of about 1,200 Israelis by Hamas terrorists on 7 October. More than 100 hostages still held. The killing of 30,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children. Much of Gaza reduced to rubble. Food, water and medical supplies all critical.\nThis should have been the time for MPs to come together. They are always talking sanctimoniously about doing this. As if they had a monopoly on enlightenment. They alone can channel the nation’s higher power.\nWhat we got was the exact opposite. An SNP opposition day debate designed to highlight splits in the Labour party. A Labour amendment created to prevent a split in its own ranks. One that bridged the gap between the SNP position and the Labour leadership. A Tory amendment whose only function was to knock out Labour’s, as there was hardly a cigarette paper between them, under the parliamentary precedent that government amendments kick out opposition ones on such occasions.\nSo there we had it. While more men, women and children were dying in Gaza, all UK parties were using the conflict for marginal, parochial gains. Just lip service to a higher calling. All claiming they cared only for bringing the war to an end. All so detached from reality they couldn’t even see they were lying to themselves. Just indulging in performative politics. Knowing there was no chance an IDF or Hamas commander was listening in. Nothing they said would make a difference. So they could say what they liked.\nThere were rumours early on Wednesday that Labour was leaning on the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to break with convention and allow both the Labour and Tory amendments to be debated. To save face for Keir Starmer. To head off a mass rebellion. There had certainly been no sign of Hoyle during science and technology questions that had preceded prime minister’s questions. Ample time for him to be got at. Though he could just as well have simply chosen to avoid listening to minister Michelle Donelan. She is the equivalent of a liquid cosh. One sentence and you’re out cold.\nHoyle had reappeared for PMQs but the moment it ended he was out the door. Hotly pursued by Starmer’s team once more. Clearly the speaker had yet to make up his mind over how to proceed. To go with convention and drop the Labour amendment or plead special circumstances and let the house vote on both amendments as well as the SNP motion.\nThe first sign of shithousery came when Labour MPs interrupted proceedings with a series of largely irrelevant points of order. First from Lucy Powell. Could the deputy speaker – Rosie Winterton was now in the chair – think of a way to get Rishi Sunak to answer the questions he had ignored during PMQs about whether Kemi Badenoch’s power of recall was sound or not? Rosie shrugged. If Labour was going to ask about Sunak not providing answers and Kemi being a liability, then we’d be here all day.\nNext up was Liam Byrne. He too was concerned about Kemi. Were the Canada trade talks actually happening or only going on in her mind? Kemi? Deluded? Who would have imagined that? John McDonnell wondered if Winterton could help with visitor access to Westminster Hall. Rosie closed her eyes. Talk to the hand. On we went. Diana Johnson demanded help accessing the 15 Home Office reports that James Cleverly was sitting on. Christ, Jimmy Dimly can’t get a refugee on a plane, let alone construct a coherent sentence.\nThen there was a concern about a £2.3bn fine owed to the EU – “cheap at the price” yelled the Tories – followed by one about yet more government troubles over the Horizon Post Office scandal. Above my pay grade, sobbed Rosie. \nFinally, Hoyle returned to the chamber. He had made a decision. He would allow both the Labour and government amendments. The Tory and SNP benches went wild with outrage. And there were we all thinking that what they really wanted was for the hostages to be returned and an end to the fighting in Gaza. Silly us. There were shouts and jeers. The always pointless Desmond Swayne snarled: “Bring back Bercow.” Parliament was about to start its own civil war. So much more exciting than the one in the Middle East.\nSomeone else shouted: “You ought to be ashamed, Lindsay.” Hoyle didn’t look entirely comfortable. He couldn’t front this one out. There was a reasonable case for breaking with convention and he should have remained defiant. But he wants to be loved too much. Maybe he couldn’t bear the thought of not getting that peerage. It takes all sorts. He looked as though he would rather be anywhere but in the speaker’s chair.\nThe speeches themselves were unremarkable. Except for the unusual hybrid of piety and bitterness. Everyone holier than thou. Sanctimony on their side. Everyone wanted a ceasefire. Only they wanted their own ceasefire, not anyone else’s ceasefire.\nUnbelievably, it all got worse. Much worse. Just before the vote was about to be taken on the Labour amendment, Penny Mordaunt made a point of order. Having failed to get one over on Labour, the Tories were going to throw their toys out the pram and not vote on anything. Not even their own amendment. Astonishingly, Mordaunt thought she was grabbing the moral high ground. Pass the sick bag.\nCue total chaos. A vote to chuck everyone out of the public gallery and sit in private. The SNP not even getting to vote on their own motion. An emotional speaker apologising to the house.\nNone of this was good enough. Not nearly. And over a war. If only MPs were capable of self-reflection they would be in a downward shame spiral.\nThis was their finest hour."

        "content": "On Wednesday lunchtime Keir Starmer was facing the biggest crisis of his career.\nEarlier in the week, he had been warned that as many as 100 of his MPs – including at least two of his shadow cabinet – were willing to rebel by voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza unless Labour brought forward its own amendment calling for one.\nHaving agreed to publish exactly such an amendment, the Labour leader now faced another hurdle: the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, was being advised not to pick it and instead call a different one from the government.\nHours away from the biggest rebellion of his leadership, Starmer decided to intervene personally and visited Hoyle in his office behind the House of Commons chamber.\n\n Related: Sir Lindsay Hoyle vowed to restore calm but now faces ‘toxic parliament’ \n\nThose briefed on the meeting said the Labour leader warned Hoyle that Labour MPs’ security was at risk. Many had been deluged by criticisms, threats and abuse since abstaining on a similar SNP motion in November. With hundreds of protesters congregating outside parliament, they worried worse might be to come.\nAfter a tense meeting, and with Labour MPs desperately stalling inside the chamber, Hoyle eventually agreed. As the Gaza debate started, the speaker announced he would call both the Labour and government amendments, prompting fury on the government and SNP benches and huge relief on the Labour ones.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a dramatic day in parliament, the speaker’s standing, at least on the government’s benches, had been left badly damaged. Starmer, however, had pulled off a political coup, eventually avoiding any rebellion at all after the government decided to pull out entirely from the evening’s votes.\n“We came minutes away from disaster,” said one senior Labour official. “Thank God for Lindsay Hoyle.”\n\n Related: While people die in Gaza, the UK parliament goes to war over the ceasefire | John Crace \n\nWednesday’s parliamentary action was the culmination of weeks of wrangling on the Labour benches, as MPs petitioned the Labour leader to change tack on Gaza while his advisers warned him against stepping out of line with the perceived international consensus.\nThe last ceasefire vote in November had triggered the biggest rebellion of Starmer’s tenure, with 56 Labour MPs defying orders to vote for the SNP motion including 10 frontbenchers.\nSince then, many of those MPs who stayed loyal have faced protests outside their constituency offices and even their homes. Their arguments about parliamentary process and the difference between a ceasefire and Labour’s proposal of a “humanitarian pause” proved ineffective as the death toll in Gaza mounted.\nMeanwhile, Starmer’s position was changing. He began to argue for an immediate end to the violence and a “ceasefire that lasts”. But as he travelled to the Munich Security Conference last week alongside his shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, he was under pressure to go further and argue explicitly for an “immediate ceasefire”.\nAs Starmer, Lammy and Healey met international leaders and well-connected diplomats in Munich, they realised international opinion was beginning to shift. With the Israelis beginning to threaten Rafah, western countries were becoming more robust in their calls for an end to the fighting.\nA turning point came last Thursday, when Australia, Canada and New Zealand published a joint statement urging an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, which gave the Labour leader cover to use the same language.\n“Don’t underestimate how significant that was,” said one senior Labour official. “Having our Five Eyes partners call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire definitely helped shape our thinking.”\nBut as Starmer returned to Westminster on Monday he had still not decided what form of words to propose in an alternative to the SNP motion. Frontbenchers, led by the shadow justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, were dispatched to warn him that anything less than a call for an immediate ceasefire would trigger a massive rebellion.\n“Many MPs who remained loyal to him last time told him they couldn’t do so again unless they were allowed to vote for an immediate ceasefire,” said one Labour source. “The situation on the ground has only got worse since then, as has the pressure on ordinary members.”\nStarmer was persuaded, and on Tuesday afternoon his whips published their amendment which called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” before laying out exactly in what circumstances one could be expected to happen.\nThe trouble was not yet over for the Labour leader, however. During a meeting in parliament, Starmer and Lammy took shadow ministers through their reasoning.\nBut elsewhere on the estate, shadow foreign minister Wayne David endured a much tougher time as he explained the new position to backbenchers.\nSeveral MPs, including Jess Phillips, who resigned in November as a shadow minister to vote with the SNP, and the backbenchers Sam Tarry and Paul Blomfield, criticised the leadership. Some were angry that the new amendment had too many caveats. Many others were furious about how long it had taken to get the party to take the position it was now taking, and how many had seen their careers damaged in the meantime.\n“The frontbench took an absolute battering,” said one person who attended the meeting.\nStarmer had an even bigger problem. Labour officials predicted correctly that the government would publish its own amendment to the SNP motion, which under parliamentary precedent would trump the Labour one. If Labour MPs were not able to vote for their own amendment calling for an “immediate ceasefire”, dozens were still willing to vote for the SNP motion.\nLabour MPs launched a frantic lobbying campaign aimed at the speaker.\nUnless Hoyle allowed the Labour amendment to come to a vote, they said, he would be forcing them to remain loyal to their party or put their own safety at risk. Several told him of the threats they had faced since abstaining on the SNP motion last time.\nThe party denied reports that Labour whips had even threatened to lead an effort to deselect him as speaker if he did not call the Labour amendment.\nStarmer’s last-minute intervention proved crucial. Finally, Hoyle entered the chamber and announced his decision to abandon precedent and call both the Labour and the government amendments. The Tory and SNP benches erupted in anger, while shadow ministers slumped in relief.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate eventually began around an hour after it was expected. Five hours later, the Labour amendment passed easily with no resistance from the government.\nStarmer had averted disaster and emerged stronger. “We came very close to a huge rebellion,” said one Labour source. “But in the end Starmer’s authority is stronger than it was before today.”"

        "content": "The Commons speaker has given Keir Starmer’s hopes of avoiding a major rebellion over Gaza a big boost by allowing the Labour leader to hold a vote on his preferred solution to the Middle East crisis.\nDozens of Labour MPs were preparing to vote on Wednesday for a Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the second time in three months.\nHowever, the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, decided to allow Labour to hold a vote on its own amendment, which calls for a ceasefire only in certain circumstances.\nIn a decision that caused fury on the government and SNP benches, the speaker explained he would allow both the government and Labour to bring amendments to the motion, something that is unusual in an opposition debate.\nHoyle said: “This is a highly sensitive subject on which feelings are running high in the house, in the nation and throughout the world. I think it’s important on this occasion that the house is able to consider the widest possible range of options.”\nHe added that he intended to rewrite the Commons rules surrounding opposition day debates, sparking anger from Tory and SNP MPs. Desmond Swayne, a Conservative backbencher, shouted: “Bring back Bercow!” in reference to Hoyle’s predecessor John Bercow.\nSoon afterwards it emerged Hoyle had made his decision against the advice of his own aides. Tom Goldsmith, the clerk of the house, wrote a letter to Hoyle afterwards saying he believed it represented “a departure from the long-established convention for dealing with such amendments on opposition days”.\nIf the Labour amendment succeeds, it will replace the SNP motion and avoid any chance for fractious Labour MPs to rebel by voting for the motion’s more blunt call for an immediate ceasefire.\nThe SNP’s motion calls for “an immediate ceasefire for all combatants”. Labour’s, on the other hand, calls for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, before qualifying that by saying Israel cannot be expected to abide by one if Hamas continues to threaten violence. Unlike the SNP motion, the Labour one also refers to the importance of a two-state solution.\nHoyle’s decision means MPs will now vote on Labour’s amendment on Wednesday evening. If the amendment succeeds, there will be no need for further votes.\nIf it fails, however, MPs will then vote on the unamended SNP motion before then voting on a government amendment, which also calls for a ceasefire but says it should only happen under a very specific set of circumstances.\nThe government’s amendment says a ceasefire should only happen if Hamas has completely relinquished control of Gaza and handed back all Israeli hostages, and if a credible process has begun leading towards a two-state solution.\nSome Labour MPs say they still intend to vote for the SNP motion should the Labour amendment fail, but party officials expect the rebellion to be much smaller than it would otherwise have been.\nBrendan O’Hara, the SNP spokesperson for foreign affairs, told the Commons at the start of the debate: “Voting for an immediate ceasefire today won’t by itself bring about the end of the slaughter.\n“But the impact and the optics of this parliament, hitherto one of Israel’s staunchest allies, saying enough is enough and calling for an immediate ceasefire would be enormous.”\nThe shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “We must not just avert a ground invasion of Rafah, essential though it is. All violence against civilians must now stop.\n“And that is why Labour is saying unequivocally that we need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to end the bloodshed and the suffering.”"

        "content": "A few days after the Hamas atrocities of 7 October, Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, attended a service of solidarity at a synagogue near Glasgow. He embraced the mother of Bernard Cowan, a Scot killed by Hamas at the kibbutz where he had settled. “Your grief is my grief,” he told her. Later that day, the SNP leader spoke to journalists at Bute House in Edinburgh: he described movingly the plight of his in-laws, who had become trapped under Israeli bombardment while visiting relatives in Gaza. He became one of the first senior political voices in the UK to call for a ceasefire on both sides to allow humanitarian aid into the territory. It’s worth remembering this context ahead of the debate on the SNP’s motion, which reiterates that call for an immediate ceasefire, five months on and more than 29,000 deaths later.   Related: What is Labour’s new position on Gaza ceasefire – and will it unite the party?   This is a matter of huge personal resonance for Yousaf, but his Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, has led on it in the Commons, returning to the matter again and again at prime minister’s questions. Party sources say this unity of purpose is a reflection of what SNP politicians – at Westminster and Holyrood – are seeing every day in their inboxes and hearing on the doorstep, as voters become increasingly horrified by what has unfolded in Gaza. Discussion of the motion has been dominated by the impact it could have on Labour, with concerns they could see a repeat of last November’s rebellion, also prompted by a similar SNP motion, in which 56 MPs rejected Keir Starmer’s more cautious stance. After Scottish Labour unequivocally backed calls for an immediate ceasefire at their conference in Glasgow last weekend, Starmer used his speech there to indicate an incremental shift in position, and a Labour amendment to the SNP motion published on Tuesday now calls for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. Meanwhile, senior Labour figures have accused the SNP of failing to build consensus, behaviour condemned as “deplorable” by the shadow Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, and of playing politics with a complex international crisis. By including a reference to Israel engaging in the “collective punishment” of the Palestinian people, say critics, the SNP deliberately makes it impossible for other parties to lend their support. There have been reports that, because of uneasiness about this particular language, Starmer will order Labour MPs to abstain from the SNP motion. But the SNP insists it has been working with groups of Labour MPs known to support an immediate ceasefire, and argues that Murray and Lisa Nandy’s call to support a Labour-amended motion that “everyone can get behind” risks ending up with a lowest common denominator view that has no international impact. As Flynn, writing for Guardian Opinion on Wednesday morning, says: “No one is pretending that one vote at Westminster will magically result in a ceasefire overnight. But a ceasefire is more likely to happen if the UK parliament and government join international pressure.” The party says this is entirely consistent with the position it has taken from those early days after the Hamas attacks – unlike Labour and the UK government. They believe that voters have appreciated the leadership Yousaf has shown – he has garnered praise from some of his most ardent critics for what they have described as his dignity and moral courage. But in an election year as high stakes as this for the SNP, with Scottish Labour toe to toe in the polls, this motion could have significance well beyond the machinations of Commons process. In his first campaign speech of the new year, Yousaf insisted that Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland” to win the general election, arguing that voting in more SNP MPs would “keep him honest”, and offering to “work constructively” with a Labour government to prevent backsliding on green investment or the creeping privatisation of the NHS. Regardless of the outcome of this afternoon’s vote, the SNP will use it to strengthen that argument."

        "content": "Boris Johnson withdrew from a debate with the US rightwinger and Putin interviewer Tucker Carlson after the death of Alexei Navalny, having previously agreed to the event for a $1m fee which his team says would have gone to charities for Ukrainian veterans. Carlson, a former Fox News host known for having launched scathing attacks against the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, revealed on the rightwing news channel Blaze TV that Johnson had initially agreed to be interviewed. The US presenter said he extended the invitation after becoming “annoyed” that Johnson had denounced him as a Kremlin stooge after his controversial interview with Putin that failed to challenge the Russian president over the bloodshed in Ukraine. The TV host claimed that Johnson had demanded $1m but this was rejected as untrue by Johnson’s camp, who said the sum was offered by Carlson and the former prime minister would have given the money to charities for Ukrainian veterans. Carlson claimed he approached the former prime minister, and a member of Johnson’s team said “it’s going to cost you $1m” and “then he will explain his position on Ukraine”. Carlson added: “I’m not defending Putin, but Putin didn’t ask for $1m … This whole thing is a freaking shakedown.” He said: “If you’re making money off a war, you know, you can deal with God on that, because that’s really immoral.” A spokesperson for Johnson said: “This account is untrue.” It is understood Johnson decided not to go ahead with it after the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, which has been widely blamed on the Kremlin. It is the latest flare-up in a row between the pair after Johnson used his Daily Mail column to brand Carlson “a traitor to journalism” for his interview with the Russian president. Johnson said the presenter had betrayed “viewers and listeners around the world” for not taking Putin to task for “the torture, the rapes, the blowing-up of kindergartens” in Ukraine. In the Carlson interview, Putin claimed Johnson helped scupper a deal aimed at ending the war – a claim that has been denied by the former MP and rubbished by senior Ukrainian figures. Since leaving parliament, Johnson has made millions of pounds giving speeches and making appearances, including £3.7m in 2023."

        "content": "Lisa Nandy has said Labour’s amendment to the Scottish National party’s motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza is a moment to “lift our debate up” away from party politics and “speak with one voice”, ahead of what is likely to be a tense Commons vote on Wednesday. On Tuesday Labour explicitly called for a ceasefire in the region for the first time since fighting broke out in October, in an attempt to defuse a fresh crisis over Keir Starmer’s stance that had led to some of the party’s MPs rebelling in a vote over a ceasefire in November. “We hope that this is a moment where we can lift our debate up away from the party politics … and the whole house can speak with one voice alongside our international partners about the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire right now,” Nandy told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The proposition that we’re putting before the house we believe can command the support of the whole house,” she said. In a carefully caveated 237-word amendment to the SNP motion calling for an immediate end to violence, Labour also calls for Israel not the invade to city of Rafah, for aid to be allowed to flow to Gaza and for the international community to work towards a two-state solution. It stresses that Israel cannot be expected to abide by a ceasefire if Hamas continues to threaten further violence. Labour’s amendment was followed by the government’s own, which also calls for a ceasefire once a long list of preconditions have been met, including that Hamas returns all hostages, that it cedes control in Gaza, that a new Palestinian government is formed and that there is a “credible pathway” to a two-state solution. The Commons speaker will choose on Wednesday morning which amendment to call. Nandy, the shadow minister for international development, said the problems with the SNP motion were twofold. Firstly, it did not lay out a “political horizon” that would make a ceasefire either achievable or sustainable, she said, and secondly, it needed to clarify that a ceasefire must be observed by Israel and Hamas. The shadow Scotland secretary, Ian Murray, issued a plea to the SNP Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, to accept Labour’s “more balanced” amendment to the Gaza motion on Wednesday, warning that without this all attempts to gather cross-party support for a ceasefire were “doomed to fail” because of the government majority. Otherwise, he said: “We will sit here tonight after all the votes have been counted and everything will have failed but the government’s [amendment] because it’s a question of mathematics. “My plea to the SNP all of last week was if you truly want parliament to speak with one voice, let’s have a balanced motion that allows everyone to get behind it.” He said that if the SNP accepted the Labour amendment to its motion, which Murray said took a broader view, recognising Israel’s position and making proposals for a pathway forward from the conflict, “then we can spend our time this morning trying to persuade government members to get behind it and perhaps there’s a better chance of something being passed rather than us just being defeated by the government”. More than 28,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed during Israel’s military campaign, according to the Palestinian health ministry, which was sparked by a Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October. In Rafah, more than 1 million people – at least half of the territory’s population – are seeking shelter without access to clean water or sanitation. In a joint statement earlier this month, Canada, New Zealand and Australia warned Israel against a ground invasion in Rafah and said an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was “urgently needed”. Nandy, who has visited the region twice in recent months, said: “It is a change in our position, it’s a significant step and not one that we’ve taken lightly.” She said that in November there had been every right to believe that a humanitarian pause was achievable. What had changed now, she said, was the collapse of the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the imminent ground invasion of Rafah. In November the SNP used the king’s speech debate to call for a vote on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. At the time, Starmer’s whips urged MPs to back a Labour motion calling instead for a “cessation of fighting”, but dozens of MPs sided with the SNP. On Tuesday afternoon, Labour officials told the Guardian they believed they had successfully persuaded party rebels to vote for the amendment and abstain on the SNP motion. When asked by the Today programme whether members would abstain from voting for the SNP motion, Nandy replied: “That’s a question for the chief whip.” She said: “We are hopeful we will have the chance to put our proposition before the house and we believe that it offers the house a chance to speak with one clear voice alongside our five eyes partners and the international community.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-21T10:00:13+00:00",
        "content": "When friends heard I was writing a book about Keir Starmer, there were the usual questions: does he believe in anything? What’s he like? Isn’t he, they asked with a frown, a bit boring? The last of these was the easiest to answer because he really isn’t dull. Starmer is good company, engagingly funny and listens in a way that too many politicians too often fail to do. There is, of course, a long tradition of advisers (or ex-advisers like me) wailing on about how they wish more voters could see this or that candidate as we do. But the gap between the reality and perception of Starmer is bigger than with most, and it cannot simply be down to the way he sometimes closes in on himself when a camera is pointed at him, or how the online snobs – largely from the left – mock his accent and call him “Keith”. The better explanation is that Starmer is complicated, as most people are, and filled with paradoxes. He’s the most working-class leader of the Labour party for a generation and also the first in its history to have the prefix “Sir” attached to his name before he got the job. He is a private and cautious man who has chosen to place himself in the white light of public scrutiny while taking some gigantic political risks, including one that ended the Labour career of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. He likes to think decisions through and sometimes changes his mind, but he has also been breathtakingly ruthless in overcoming more polished or popular opponents in the Tory party and his own. None of that’s dull; it’s just very difficult to define. And part of him still instinctively resists any effort to do so. He didn’t always relish the process of me writing a biography about him. Over the course of the past couple of years and dozens of conversations, I’ve had to prod or cajole him into talking about things that middle-aged Englishmen are not always comfortable discussing: an intensely difficult relationship with his father; a sense of separation from his brother and the sisters he left behind as he pursued a career in London; the source of a hard-driving ambition that one of his ex-girlfriends remembers as involving “not much reflection and no stopping … which can make life difficult for others around him because there really aren’t many people made of that kind of stuff”.   If many of Johnson’s wounds appeared self-inflicted, it was often Starmer’s scalpel that made the first incision   For most of Starmer’s life, he hasn’t had to talk or even think too hard about all of this. His identity was built around the three decades he spent as a successful human rights barrister and then director of public prosecutions. He never won a case on the basis that he grew up in a “pebbledash semi”, while the now well-worn phrase “My dad was a toolmaker and my mum was a nurse” did not cross his lips until he was in his late 50s. At one stage, I wanted to call my biography of him The Unpolitician because he doesn’t fit the template of political leaders. His backstory is messy and flawed, and he has neither a grandiose vision that can be summed up in a three-word slogan nor the kind of charisma that for so long made so many think Boris Johnson was unbeatable. However, even if “unpolitician” had been a real word, it still wouldn’t have been a fair description of Starmer who, for all his misgivings about this profession, has learned how to become pretty good at it. He is fallible and still makes some unforced errors, as he did in comments over Israel and Gaza last year, or this month in initially allowing Labour to stand by its candidate Azhar Ali over some awful antisemitic remarks. But separate the wood from the trees and the real significance of that last row is how he eventually did something I don’t remember any major party leader doing in living memory, which was to sack a candidate in the midst of a byelection he expected to win. But he has pulled Labour from being way behind in the polls to 20 points ahead. And those who dismiss this achievement as that of a “lucky general” are underestimating him in the same way many defeated opponents once did. If many of Johnson’s wounds appeared self-inflicted, it was often Starmer’s forensic and lawyerly scalpel that made the first incision. When Liz Truss was terrifying citizens and markets alike, Starmer provided reassurance where Labour would previously have offered only an alternative kind of fear. When Rishi Sunak initially seemed to be contesting the territory of centrist competence and decency, the Labour leader held it while Sunak was dragged into the badlands of the Conservative party’s wildest frontiers. Indeed, a testament to his success in transforming the Labour party and its electoral fortunes is that the biggest question hanging over Starmer now seems to be whether winning is enough. There are plenty of critics inside the party who are angry at the way he has abandoned some – if not all – of the “10 pledges” on which he fought the leadership election in 2020. Still more despair of recent retreats from an earlier promise to spend £28bn a year on green investment. Others suggest his efforts to root out antisemitism are being used to purge the left and that he has been captured by the right. Part of the problem is that Starmer steadfastly refuses to place himself on an ideological spectrum or bind himself too tightly to a particular set of policies. Chris Ward, who was one of his principal advisers until 2021 and remains close to him now, told me: “One of Keir’s greatest strengths is that he’s never been from or beholden to a particular faction of the Labour party. I think that’s because – unlike almost every previous Labour leader – he didn’t spend his life in the Labour party and it isn’t his whole life, even now. It’s why he could win a leadership contest from the soft left, but now lead it from the centre-right. His focus is always on getting him closer to the goal of winning an election and changing the country – and he’s smart enough to find different parts of the party to get him there at different times.” But even Ward worries about the direction of travel. “The danger, of course, is that he ultimately ends up trapped by one faction or becomes isolated when the going gets tough. That’s always been my biggest fear. Whether he can avoid that in No 10, and finally get the chance to do all the things he came into politics to do, is the next big challenge he’ll face.” For my part, I think the argument made casually by a lot of people these days that he stands for nothing is well wide of the mark. The five missions he announced last year and which are still under-reported remain key to understanding what he would do. And each of them is rooted in everyday values based on friendship, family and football. The third is a huge part of his makeup and usually his metaphor of choice; when, for instance, he speaks of yearning for the chance to get into government and show what he can do, he inevitably describes it as “doing his talking on the pitch”. When he talks about watching Arsenal, there is a sense of this tightly bound man revelling in the experience of losing himself in a crowd. He can be almost lyrical about the feeling when a late winner is scored and “everyone stands up, hands in the air … like there’s a magnet in the sky above the stadium”.   His mission to halve violence against women and girls goes way beyond the usual banalities expressed by a lot of politicians   But his values show themselves in other ways too. Talking about his schooldays, he expresses his disgust at how a friend of his was chucked out of his family’s home for being gay by a father who declared: “You’re no son of mine.” Later, the young Starmer got beaten up in a nightclub after he came to the aid of the same friend, who “didn’t do much to conceal” his sexuality, when he had been attacked by some kids who “decided the way to prove they weren’t gay too was by punching and kicking him”. That says a lot for a sporty teenager in the early 1980s, and those same values are obvious now when he described going to the same-sex wedding of his niece Jess in 2022 and reflected on the progress Britain has made from the old days. Then just six weeks later, Starmer told me of how he had got a nasty reminder of “how far we have to go”, after Jess and her wife were leaving a pub in the town where they live and work. “It’s a friendly place, small enough for them to know most people. It’s their manor,” he said. “They were hand in hand like the newlyweds they are, when three men came up to them. These cowards punched Jess many times, fracturing her cheekbone, for no reason except she’s a lesbian.” In cold fury, he tossed his phone across the table at me. It showed two photographs of her face: the first looking radiant and happy on her wedding day, the other almost unrecognisably swollen and purple after the attack. Starmer’s anger over what happened to his niece, and – despite his best efforts with the police – the failure to prosecute those responsible, is an emotion you rarely see from him in public. But it’s impossible to listen to him talking about the horrific murders of Fiona Ivison or Jane Clough – cases he was involved in as a lawyer and prosecutor – or a more recent visit to a women’s refuge in Birmingham, without coming away knowing that his declared mission to halve violence against women and girls goes way beyond the usual banalities expressed by a lot of politicians. In private, he frequently shows grief and joy on behalf of ordinary people, who offer him a bridge back into a world that politics doesn’t always understand. And there is a real warmth in the way Starmer talks about the people and places that make up this country. One of his stories that stuck most in my mind involved being on holiday last summer in the Lake District when he took his children back to a cottage he stayed in with his parents when he was their age. “We knocked on the door and a woman was kind enough to let us in and show us around. She noticed our car moving and thought someone was stealing it, so I explained that was just my police protection team. Her husband started laughing and saying she hadn’t clocked I was a politician. She said if I told her that earlier she would have taken the chance to push me down the stairs,” he said. This may not be either the funniest or the most inspirational anecdote you’ll hear from a political leader, but it was worth recording because it shows the pleasure Starmer takes at still being anonymous within all that muddle of Britain where nuance and ambiguity may yet offer a better chance of progress and finding consensus than the most puffed-up vision.   Related: If you win by saying almost nothing, what happens when you take power? Welcome to the Starmer paradox | John Harris   It would obviously be ludicrous to suggest he is the only political leader to have family members, friends and experiences outside “the bubble” – almost all do and doubtless gain insight from them because even the most out-of-touch politician has a real life somewhere too. What’s more unusual about Starmer, though, is his desire to prevent too much cross-contamination. For instance, when he made repeated visits to his seriously ill brother in a Leeds hospital during 2022, he kept it secret. And, when he later stood up in front of a couple of hundred health professionals to make a speech there – typically a perfect platform for a Labour leader – he kept the media away because for him all that mattered was saying thank you for the care they had given. So when people ask me what the Labour leader is really like, my answer is always going to be complicated because there’s something quite extraordinary in him still being quite normal. He once made a speech where he talked about an “ordinary hope”. It’s the best place to start if you’re searching for some optimism. • Keir Starmer: The Biography by Tom Baldwin (William Collins, £25) is published on 29 February.

In an incident that the book’s author, Tom Baldwin, suggests demonstrates Starmer’s values, the Labour leader describes how he was disgusted that his friend had been kicked out of the family home in the 1980s for being gay by his father who told him “you’re no son of mine”. In the summer after he sat his A-levels in 1980, Starmer and two friends from school, Mark and Graham, worked at a holiday centre for a disability charity in Cornwall, where they went on a night out. “Graham didn’t do much to conceal that he was gay,” recalls Starmer, “and some of the local kids decided the way to prove they weren’t gay too was by punching and kicking him. Mark and I got involved, so all three of us ended up getting beaten up.” In the book, Keir Starmer: The Biography, Starmer adds: “When I’m told how ‘things were better in the old days’, people forget about the ways Britain has become less cruel and less full of hate. We can all take some pride in that.” Starmer describes going to the same-sex wedding of his niece Jess in 2022 and reflecting on the progress Britain had made.

        "content": "Food businesses sending products to the EU have had to fork out an extra £170m in export costs because of Brexit red tape, with the changes described as being “catastrophic” for some exporters. Data shared with the Guardian shows that in the three years since leaving the single market, exporters of foods of animal origin have had to pay the sums to secure sign-offs by vets before they can send their shipments. In the past 12 months alone, exporters have paid more than £58m. The extra costs have resulted in a sharp fall in exports, particularly among smaller producers, with the value of meat products sent to the EU down by 17% since 2019.   Related: English farmers to be offered ‘largest ever’ grant scheme amid food security concerns   After the UK officially left the single market in January 2021, the EU made it a requirement for exporters of foods of animal origin to have vets check consignments and sign export health certificates (EHCs) before they could be sent. The UK brought in reciprocal measures last month, raising fears that some EU exporters might abandon exporting to the UK owing to the extra costs and bureaucracy. Since December 2020, the month before the UK left the single market, more than 852,000 certificates have been requested by exporters, according to analysis by the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Certification Working Group, which brings together trade bodies such as the Fresh Produce Consortium, Dairy UK and the Road Haulage Association. These include certificates for fish and fish products, livestock, and meat and dairy products. The group calculated that these certificates – which cost about £200 to complete – have heaped more than £170m in added costs for exporters over the past three years. Peter Hardwick, the trade policy adviser at the British Meat Processors Association, said the extra costs had been “catastrophic” for some smaller companies. The rules had hurt small businesses most because it was now much harder to send small mixed consignments to the EU, as they did pre-Brexit, because they would require multiple certificates, resulting in far higher exporting costs, he added. The SPS working group calculated that food exporters, which generally operate on margins of about 2%, would have needed to raise £8.5bn more in revenue just to cover their extra costs. Karin Goodburn, the director general of the Chilled Food Association, said the certificates were just one element of the costs businesses faced and the true figure would be far higher when new IT systems, administration costs and extra staff were factored in. Goodburn, who is also the chair of the SPS group, said: “We’ve had companies employ extra staff to do the new bureaucracy, one of my members had to employ 30 new staff just to shift the paperwork.” The figure for the extra costs comes as data from the Office for National Statistics last week showed the amount of meat products exported to the EU from the UK in 2023 totalled £1.26bn, a 17% drop from the £1.53bn exported in 2019. This was the second-lowest figure in the past decade, with the lowest coming in 2021, the year after the rules came in, where £1.13bn of meat products was exported. That year’s figure would have also been affected by Covid-19 restrictions. Hardwick said many bigger companies had no option but to take the hit with these new costs, and this was resulting in smaller profits, or, in some cases, higher prices for consumers. He added: “For some [smaller] businesses that has been terminal. I say terminal, not that they have gone out of business, but that it is just not worth their while in exporting any more.” Last month, the UK brought in new export health certificate requirements for EU companies exporting products of animal origin into the UK as part of its Border Target Operating Model changes. The Guild of Fine Food, which represents 12,000 independent food businesses, said small European suppliers of cheeses and meats could give up on sending goods to the UK. However, British farmers welcomed the change as it gives them an advantage over foreign producers in the domestic market. Labour has said that if it gets into power, it will aim to strike a veterinary agreement with the EU, which would remove the need for some of these costs but could take years to finalise and would require the UK to agree with EU standards on these goods. Goodburn said the UK had led on food hygiene legislation across Europe for the three decades during which it was in the EU single market.  “So, we helped create the laws, we led on packages of the hygiene law, and now it’s been deemed through the deal that we have to get certificates to prove that we comply with it.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been contacted. • This article was amended on 21 February 2024. In an earlier version, a reference to calculations of the extra revenue needed for exporters to cover the administrative costs incurred due to Brexit was attributed to the BMPA rather than the SPS working group."

        "content": "Keir Starmer’s attempt to head off a damaging rebellion over Gaza was hanging by a thread last night, despite bowing to pressure by finally calling for an immediate ceasefire in the region. Labour explicitly backed an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” for the first time since fighting broke out in October, in a bid to ward off another party split in what is likely to be a tense Commons vote on Wednesday. The Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire has stoked divisions within the Labour party and outside, with several thousand protesters expected to march on Westminster just as the vote is called. Labour officials believed on Tuesday afternoon that they had successfully persuaded party rebels to vote for their carefully caveated amendment and abstain on the more blunt SNP motion.   Related: Keir Starmer risks biggest rebellion of his leadership over Gaza vote, MPs warn   However, they believe that if the Commons Speaker chooses the government amendment ahead of the Labour one, it is likely to lead to a rebellion similar in scale to that seen last November, in which 56 Labour MPs sided with the SNP. A Labour source said: “Everything now rests with the Speaker. Our amendment should be enough to avoid another major rebellion on Gaza, but we’re not sure what MPs will do if it is not even called for a vote.” Labour’s position on the Middle East crisis has come under intense scrutiny since the war began, with many in the party accusing Starmer of reacting too slowly to events in the region and backing the Israeli government for too long. Party tensions came to a head last November when the SNP used the king’s speech debate to call for a vote on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. With Starmer concerned about not wanting to go further than either the British or American governments, his whips urged MPs to back a Labour motion calling instead for a “cessation of fighting”. This was not enough, however, to prevent dozens of MPs, including eight frontbenchers, siding with the SNP in what became the biggest rebellion of his leadership. Since then, many Labour MPs who remained loyal and abstained on the SNP amendment have been deluged by angry messages from constituents and activists demanding to know why they “voted against a ceasefire”. The SNP is seeking to reopen those wounds on Wednesday with a similarly worded motion calling once more for an immediate ceasefire. Once more Labour has published its own text which it wants MPs to back instead of the SNP motion. However, under heavy pressure from senior pro-Palestinian Labour MPs, the party is this time calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. The 237-word Labour amendment also calls for Israel not to invade the city of Rafah, for aid to be allowed to flow to Gaza, and for international countries to work towards a two-state solution. It stresses, however, that Israel cannot be expected to abide by a ceasefire if Hamas continues to threaten further violence. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC on Tuesday: “We have set down a motion calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. That is because the situation now in Gaza is intolerable, with the dramatic loss of life, with so many people facing starvation, and we are very clear that the Rafah offensive now being planned cannot go ahead. “This is a comprehensive motion, and it’s one that I hope that the whole house can now get behind.” But in a separate interview on LBC, he hinted the party would not back an unamended SNP motion. “The SNP motion calls for an immediate ceasefire,” he said. “It doesn’t speak to that ceasefire being lasting.” By Tuesday afternoon, the alternative Labour motion looked to have secured broad agreement even from many of those who rebelled in November. Clive Betts, one of those Labour rebels, told the BBC’s World at One: “It is a revised and good position. I don’t think anyone can see the horrors of what is happening now in Gaza and not want the fighting to stop and stop immediately. That is what the Labour motion says.” Hours later, however, the government published its own amendment, which also calls for a ceasefire but only once a long list of preconditions have been met. They include Hamas returning all hostages, that it cedes control in Gaza, that a new Palestinian government is formed and that there is a “credible pathway” to a two-state solution. The Commons Speaker will choose on Wednesday morning which amendment to call. Government sources insist that parliamentary precedent dictates that it should be theirs, but Labour officials say the Speaker should focus on which ones best allows the public’s views to be aired in the Commons. Many in the Labour party believe that if the Speaker chooses the government amendment, dozens of Labour MPs will vote instead for the SNP motion, in what would be another bruising rebuff to Starmer’s authority. One party source said: “This situation is so tense that an attempt to create party unity on it for the first time in months could genuinely be scuppered by obscure parliamentary processes.” Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales called for the fighting to end “as soon as possible” and for more humanitarian support for Gaza. Prince William issued a statement before carrying out visits to recognise the human suffering caused by conflict in the Middle East and the global rise in antisemitism. “I remain deeply concerned about the terrible human cost of the conflict in the Middle East since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7. Too many have been killed,” he said. “I, like so many others, want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible. There is a desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza. It’s critical that aid gets in and the hostages are released. “Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home. “Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair. I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.” Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy responded: “Israelis of course want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible, and that will be possible once the 134 hostages are released, and once the Hamas terror army threatening to repeat the 7 October atrocities is dismantled. “We appreciate the Prince of Wales’s call for Hamas to free the hostages. “We also recall with gratitude his statement from 11 October condemning Hamas’s terror attacks and reaffirming Israel’s right of self-defence against them.”"

        "content": "What is Labour’s new position on a Gaza ceasefire – and how big a change is it? For the first time since the 7 October attacks, Labour is now calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, though it is qualifying that by saying the ceasefire should be “humanitarian”. The difference is important. Labour says the ceasefire should only happen if both sides agree, and that Israel cannot be expected to stop fighting if Hamas is still threatening further attacks. Otherwise, the party wants a pause in fighting to allow aid to get through to Gaza. It is also calling for Israel not to invade Rafah, where 1.5 million people are taking shelter. The difference between the current position and the one the party took last year is the use of the word “ceasefire”. In November, the party called for an “enduring cessation of fighting” instead, telling its MPs to abstain on the Scottish National party motion calling explicitly for a ceasefire. Since that vote, many Labour MPs have been bombarded with messages from angry constituents asking why they voted against a ceasefire, and have struggled to explain the nuance of November’s vote. Why has this decision been made now? Starmer has been gradually shifting his position on Gaza over the past few months. Having first ruled out a ceasefire, he then began talking about a cessation of fighting, before saying he wanted to work towards an enduring ceasefire. However, three things have prompted a noticeable shift in position over the last week. The first was a joint statement by Canada, Australia and New Zealand last week calling for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” and for Israel not to attack Rafah. This gave Starmer cover to adopt similar language. The second was the Scottish Labour conference this weekend, at which members voted in favour of an immediate ceasefire. Starmer managed to avoid any impression of a split with Scottish Labour – and its leader, Anas Sarwar – by giving a speech in which he said: “The fighting must stop now.” Opposition whips have now published an amendment to the SNP motion setting out the party’s stance on the crisis, which they hope Labour MPs will back instead of a separate amendment from the SNP calling more bluntly for an immediate ceasefire. Labour’s amendment, which will be put to the vote on Wednesday, has really focused minds. Labour has known for weeks the SNP was likely to call a vote almost identical to that in November, which did such damage on the Labour benches. Last week at the Munich security conference, Starmer, his shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, thrashed out an amendment to the SNP motion which they hope will finally unite their party. Will Starmer’s tactics work? Several Labour MPs who rebelled last time say they support the party’s new amendment and are willing to vote for it and abstain on the SNP amendment, as whips are likely to demand. Some will rebel, but Starmer’s team is hopeful it will be fewer than last time and will not involve any more frontbenchers resigning. The big risk, however, is that the Speaker of the House of Commons picks the government amendment and not the Labour one. Given the government amendment talks about working towards a permanent ceasefire but does not call for an immediate one, some Labour MPs may feel they cannot then abstain on the broader SNP motion. Whether Starmer faces an even bigger rebellion than he did in November may now rest in the Speaker’s hands."

        "content": "Almost a third of the MPs attempting to water down or delay new laws to better protect England’s 11 million private renters are landlords, analysis has revealed. MPs including Bob Blackman, Nick Fletcher, Marco Longhi and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown are pressing for changes to the long-awaited renters’ reform bill, which will ban no-fault evictions. They want to make it easier for landlords to throw out tenants for antisocial behaviour instead. The MPs are among 47 Conservative backbenchers who have signed amendments that housing campaigners fear will “gut” legislation crucial to improving rights for the one in five households in England who rent privately. There are also fears that the reforms will not happen before the general election. According to an analysis of the register of members’ financial interests by the Renters’ Reform Coalition, a campaign group, 14 of the MPs backing the changes to the bill are landlords, renting out a combined 52 homes. The MPs also want to force Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, to review the operation of county courts before banning no-fault evictions. And, alongside other landlord MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Desmond Swayne, they want the current fixed-term tenancy system to continue in certain circumstances, instead of allowing tenants more flexibility to end tenancies where they need to.   Related: Renters’ reform must close loopholes for unfair evictions, campaigners say   Tom Darling, the campaign manager of the Renters’ Reform Coalition, said: “Those making money out of our broken housing system should not be holding up and watering down reforms to give renters more rights. “That these landlord MPs are now choosing to sign amendments to water down, delay or even stop altogether these vital reforms is shocking. We are now worried that the government will try to do a deal with these MPs to get a bill passed that offers little improvement for renters.” The demand for court reform is widely considered a delaying tactic, while calling for hearsay evidence to be allowed to justify evictions for antisocial behaviour is seen as a way of softening the effect on landlords of the proposed ban on no-fault evictions. Last year the number of families thrown out of their homes by bailiffs after being served with section 21 no-fault eviction papers surged by 49% to 9,457. Many more households were served with no-fault eviction notices but left before bailiffs were required. Housing charities warn that no-fault evictions are a key driver of homelessness.   Related: No-fault evictions in England ‘soaring out of control’, say campaigners   Responding to the analysis, Swayne, who rents out two properties, said his interests were properly declared and parliamentary debate on the bill was not holding it up. “There is a proper debate to be had as to whether the extent of the proposals will reduce the availability of rented accommodation and so make greater difficulties for potential tenants,” he said. “In a democracy, it is right that these arguments be heard. If supporters of the proposals want their way, they need to win the argument, rather than slinging mud and making false assertions.” Blackman, Fletcher, Longhi, Clifton-Brown and Rees-Mogg were all contacted for comment. The ban on no-fault evictions was first promised by the Conservative government almost five years ago and was then included in the party’s manifesto for the 2019 general election. Campaigners for private renting households are calling for no further dilution of the renters’ reform bill. Labour has said it will ban section 21 evictions quickly if it wins power. At the weekend Gove said the government would end no-fault evictions by the time of a general election, which the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has indicated is likely to be held this autumn. “We will have outlawed it and we will put the money into the courts in order to ensure that they can enforce it,” he told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Our landmark renters (reform) bill will deliver a fairer private rented sector for both tenants and landlords. It will abolish section 21 evictions – giving people more security in their homes and empowering them to challenge poor practices. The bill will return to the House of Commons shortly.” The landlord Conservative MPs who have backed amendments to the renters (reform) bill Nick Fletcher, MP for Don Valley – 10 properties Marco Longhi, MP for Dudley North – 10 properties Bob Blackman, MP for Harrow East – 6 properties Geoffrey Clinton-Brown, MP for The Cotswolds – 5 properties James Gray, MP for North Wiltshire – 4 properties Royston Smith, MP for Southampton, Itchen – 3 properties Craig Mackinlay, MP for South Thanet – 3 properties Desmond Swayne, MP for New Forest West – 2 properties Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset – 2 properties Anne Marie Morris, MP for Newton Abbot – 2 properties Philip Dunne, MP for Ludlow – 2 properties Bill Wiggin, MP for North Herefordshire – 1 property Steve Double, MP for St Austell and Newquay – 1 property Theresa Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet – 1 property Source: Register of Members’ Financial Interests/Renters’ Reform Coalition"

        "content": "  5.46pm GMT  Afternoon summary   David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has said that he hopes the government will back a Labour amendment calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza. He was speaking on Radio 4’s PM programme, where he said that if that were to happen, the Commons would be “speaking with one voice”. The SNP has welcomed the wording of the amendment, saying Keir Starmer performed a U-turn under pressure from the Scottish nationalists. But the government is reportedly planning to table its own amendment to the SNP motion being debated tomorrow. This would prolong the difficulty for Starmer on this issue if the speaker ends up choosing the government’s amendment, not Labour’s. (See 5.01pm.)   The Home Office has just announced that David Neal has been sacked as independent chief inspector of borders and immigration. He was due to leave near the end of March, but a Home Office spokesperson said:   We have terminated the appointment of David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, after he breached the terms of appointment and lost the confidence of the home secretary.  In an interview in the Times published yesterday, Neal revealed that a quarter of foreign care workers are abusing UK visa rules by working illegally. In his story Matt Dathan said:  David Neal has disclosed a series of findings from his inspection into the Home Office’s handling of the social care visa route since it was introduced two years ago to help plug chronic labour shortages in the industry. He found that the Home Office had issued 275 visas to a care home that did not exist and 1,234 to a company that stated it had only four staff when given a license to operate. These two examples had led to more than 1,500 migrants being allowed to move to the UK under the guise of having a job in the social care sector. Neal submitted his report earlier this month but it is one of 13 reports that he has submitted in the past year that remain unpublished by the Home Office. Despite being independent, the department has discretion over when to publish his reports … As part of his findings, Neal said that his inspectors encountered migrants with care visas working illegally in two out of eight enforcement visits between August and October last year. He said it was representative of the proportion of migrants on care visas working in the UK more broadly, meaning that about 25,000 of the 101,316 people granted a social care visa in the year to September last year would have been working in other sectors illegally.  And, in a separate interview with the Daily Mail, Neal said high-risk private jets were landing in the UK without their passengers being subject to security checks.  Rishi Sunak may face another difficult byelection after an MP lost his appeal against a 35-day suspension from parliament for offering to lobby ministers on behalf of the gambling industry.   Britain is showing signs of recovery from its mild recession and will receive a boost when interest rates start coming down later this year, the Bank of England governor has said.   Rishi Sunak has told farmers “I have your back”, at the National Farmers Union conference, as he promised to “change the culture” in government around farming.   Peter Mandelson, the former cabinet minister and one of the leading figures in New Labour, has criticised the party for championing citizens’ assemblies, and proposing to tighten the hunting ban. In an interview with Times Radio, he said the party should be focusing on the issues that matter most to voters. He said:   I mean, I’m sure there’s a lot to be said for citizens’ assemblies, but is that really the voters priority in this election year? Or the Labour announcement that we’re suddenly going to reopen the issue of foxhunting, not to scrap the ban, but to tighten it up and to relitigate the whole issue? I mean, these are third or fourth order issues for the public. They’ve got to remain focussed on their strategy and on the key issues which are important to voters.  He said Labour should campaign primarily on the economy, the NHS and crime.  Michael Gove failed to register hospitality he enjoyed with a Conservative donor whose company he had recommended for multimillion-pound personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts during the Covid pandemic, the Guardian can reveal.

If so, what is required for that assurance to be given, and who determines it has been provided? More generally the way in which Labour has recently reached some decisions does not bode well for government. It’s full-on in power.      5.10pm GMT  Government's anti-boycott bill would have affected people campaigning against apartheid, Peter Hain tells peers  Campaigners against apartheid-era South Africa’s regime would have fallen foul of a new bill seeking to banning British public bodies from boycotting Israel, according to Peter Hain, former Labour minister and anti-apartheid activist. The Labour peer was speaking out in Lords against the government’s economic activity of public bodies (overseas matters) bill, which faces opposition from churches, charities and some Conservatives. Vladimir Putin would have been proud of the bill, Hain told fellow peers, describing it as a “another pernicious piece of legislation of an authoritarian government attacking the freedom to protest against injustice and oppression.” “This Conservative party is on the wrong side of history as it was over the fight against the most institutionalised system of racism the world has ever seen, namely apartheid,” said Hain, who said it echoed part of Margaret Thatcher’s 1988 Local Government Act to prevent local authorities from boycotting goods from apartheid South Africa. “The right to boycott is a principle that has had a massive impact for good in the recent past,” he added, recalling that consumer boycott was at the heart of anti-apartheid campaigns for 35 years. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has championed the bill as a way to ensure local councils and other bodies do not take action that is inconsistent with the UK government’s foreign policy. The government has criticised two Labour-led councils for boycotting Israel and some in the Conservative party hoped the bill would divide the Labour party. But, several senior Tories last year spoke out against it and warned that it could inflame tensions between Jewish and Muslim communities already heightened by war in the Middle East.     5.04pm GMT   If the government is looking for text for an amendment to the SNP’s Gaza motion, it could opt for the “Prince William amendment” – the statement put out by the Prince of Wales today.

Meaning Labour could be unable to push theirs.  This will make tomorrow more awkward for Labour for two reasons. First, it could result in Labour MPs not getting the chance to vote on their own amendment (at least, based on how the rules normally work – see 3.55pm). And, second, that would mean the first vote would be on the original SNP motion, meaning Labour would have to choose between telling its MPs to vote for it (difficult, because Labour has resisted it for so long, and because it accuses Israel of “the collective punishment of the Palestinian people”), vote against it (also difficult, because privately many Labour MPs agree with it) or abstain (which would look like a cop-out).

Too many innocent men, women and children have suffered.The violence must end.      4.20pm GMT  Momentum claims Labour's Gaza amendment 'falls well short' of what is needed  Although the SNP has welcomed the Labour amendment on Gaza (see 3.27pm), Momentum, the leftwing Labour group, has complained that it does not go far enough. In a statement it said:  Scratch the surface of this amendment and it falls well short of what the moment requires: a clear call for an immediate ceasefire.By making its call for a ceasefire so conditional and caveated, the Labour leadership is giving cover for Israel’s brutal war to continue. With nearly 30,000 Palestinians killed, around half of them children, and an ICJ ruling of plausible genocide, Labour should be providing the moral leadership the Tories lack, not muddying the waters.Simply put, Keir Starmer should get off the fence and unreservedly call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to Israel’s collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Alongside dozens of international NGOs today, we urge Labour MPs to vote for the SNP amendment for an immediate ceasefire.      3.55pm GMT  What happens next with Gaza ceasefire vote?  The SNP statement (see 3.27pm) implies that they will vote for the Labour amendment, but the party has not said that explicitly yet. My colleague Libby Brooks, who has been seeking clarification on this point, has sent me this.  While Stephen Flynn says he welcomes Starmer’s “apparent” support for their position in a “long overdue U-turn”, the SNP says it’s unable to confirm whether it would accept the Labour amendment because – this is getting more mired in Commons procedure by the second – firstly, they haven’t seen the final wording of that amendment and secondly, they don’t know yet whether than amendment will be taken by the speaker and how it might interact with other amendments, for example put forward by the government.   The situation is a bit more complicated than usual because tomorrow is an opposition day debate – a debate on a motion selected by an opposition party, in this case the SNP – and the rules about when amendments are called are different on these occasions. Normally MPs vote on the amendment to the motion first, and then the main motion (or the main motion as amended, if the amendment passes) later. Tomorrow the main motion will be the SNP one. If the government tables an amendment, that will be taken after the vote on the main motion (a rule that is in place to ensure that opposition parties do get the chance once in a while to actually vote on a motion they have tabled). But if another opposition party tables an amendment, that would be taken before the vote on the main motion. One possible outcome tomorrow is that the Labour amendment gets put to a vote first, it passes, and then it becomes the motion passed by the house as a whole. (Tory MPs won’t vote against it because it is more or less identical to the position as set out by David Cameron, the foreign secretary.) But we don’t know yet whether the speaker will actually call the Labour amendment. And we don’t know yet whether the government will table its own amendment. According to ITV’s Robert Peston, if it does, the Labour one won’t get called. The SNP has been allotted a full day tomorrow, but it is holding two half-day debates, instead of one full-day one. The Gaza one is due first, meaning the vote or votes should take place around 4pm. The second motion is one saying the government should invest £28bn a year on a green energy investment programme. This has clearly been tabled to embarrass Labour, which has just dropped its commitment to spending £28bn a year on green measures. (The Gaza motion was also at least in part intended to create difficulties for Labour too, although the SNP’s commitment to an immediate ceasefire is undoubtedly very genuine.)     3.27pm GMT  SNP welcomes Labour's call for 'immediate humanitarian ceasefire' in Gaza, claiming it forced Starmer into U-turn  The SNP has welcomed Labour’s decision to call for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in its amendment to the motion on Gaza being debated tomorrow. In a statement implying his party is happy with the Labour wording, Stephen Flynn says Keir Starmer has performed a U-turn under pressure from the SNP. He is also suggesting that Labour frontbenchers sacked or made to resign for voting for an SNP ceasefire amendment in November should be given their jobs back. Here is Flynn’s statement in full.  I welcome this long-overdue U-turn from Sir Keir Starmer who now appears to support the SNP’s call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. However, the plain truth is Sir Keir was forced into this position through public pressure and, in particular, by the SNP. It’s telling that it took the SNP to insert a backbone into the Labour party and act as Westminster’s conscience on this conflict. Questions will naturally arise as to why it’s taken Sir Keir so long to change his mind, what his long months of prevarication achieved, and whether he will reinstate the MPs he sacked in November for supporting the same position he finally holds too. These are all questions the Labour party leader will now have answer – I am just relieved that he has finally changed his mind and changed his position. This change of position shows what Scotland can achieve when a strong team of SNP MPs puts pressure on the Labour party to act in line with our values. Since Westminster rejected a ceasefire in November, more than 29,000 Palestinian children, women and men have been killed. It’s vital MPs don’t make the same mistake again. The focus is now squarely on Rishi Sunak. Both he and Sir Keir Starmer shared the same position until now – I hope he now takes the opportunity to reverse his stance too. I urge Rishi Sunak and the UK government to join with the vast majority of the international community, back an immediate ceasefire – and then ensure the UK government acts on it by applying the maximum diplomatic pressure.  The government has not yet said what position its MPs will be asked to take in the vote tomorrow, but there is nothing in the Labour wording that contradicts what Rishi Sunak and David Cameron have said in setting out their own views on a Gaza ceasefire.  Updated at 3.30pm GMT    3.15pm GMT  Home Office minister Tom Pursglove says closure of family scheme will not stop Ukrainians coming to UK for sanctuary  A Home Office minister said he wants the visa process to be “light touch” and “easy as possible” for Ukrainians, despite the government’s announcement that it will close the Ukraine family scheme, PA Media reports. PA says:  Tom Pursglove told the Commons that Ukrainians will continue to be offered sanctuary in the UK and any suggestion otherwise is “deliberate scaremongering”. MPs criticised the move by the Home Office, stating it is “particularly cruel” to announce the end of the scheme as the two-year anniversary of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion approaches. The decision to close the Ukraine family scheme, which allowed applicants to join family members or extend their stay in the UK, was announced among a series of changes to immigration rules set out in a policy document. The document also confirmed a visa extension scheme, which meant Ukrainian nationals and their immediate relatives could apply for permission to remain in the country, will close on 16 May. During a Commons urgent question, Pursglove told MPs: “There will continue to be an in-country opportunity for people to apply to extend their visas. Through the homes for Ukraine scheme, Ukrainians will still be able to come to the UK to access that sanctuary that we are right to be proud in supporting … Any suggestion that that will not be the case moving forward is wrong and it’s deliberate scaremongering, and people should stop it.” Asked if reports about the family scheme being closed were wrong, Pursglove replied: “There will continue to be an out-of-country route through the homes for Ukraine scheme … as well as the extension to those visas.” Labour MP Barry Sheerman said: “A lot of the people in this country, including my constituents, will be amazed that in this week – the week of (Alexei) Navalny’s murder by Putin and by the tough times that the Ukrainians are facing against the Russian re-enforcements – that this is the day they announce that there is going to be restrictions on Ukrainian families coming here.” Pursglove replied: “Ukrainians who are here will continue to be able to have that sanctuary in the years ahead.”      3.03pm GMT  UK shows signs of recovery from mild recession, says Bank of England  Britain is showing signs of recovery from its mild recession and will receive a boost when interest rates start coming down later this year, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, indicated in evidence to the Commons Treasury committee this morning. Larry Elliott has the story here.

(See 9.54am.) Murray explains Labour’s amendment to Flynn in terms that might be described a little terse, telling him:  I fully appreciate the politics of the SNP having a sole focus on the Labour party with your motion and debate but, as you know, it’s incumbent on those proposing motion to seek support from the whole house. On a matter of such importance, we must do all that we can in order for the House of Commons to speak with one voice. In that spirit we have place an amendment to your motion that seeks the same immediate humanitarian ceasefire but broadens the proposition by outlining not just a much more wide-ranging position than the SNP motion but gives a plan for how to get to the peace we all crave.  Murray emphasises the need for a “credible plan” for peace and urges Flynn to accept the “balanced and wide ranging amendment in good faith before the debate tomorrow so we can all turn our attention to working for the house to speak with one voice”. Here is the text of Murray’s letter.  In order to send a message parliament has to pass a motion which requires government MPs. Rather than a defeated motion I think we should have something everyone can get behind.

In an interview with the BBC’s Farming Today, he was asked if he could categorically deny the claim made by Henry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, that he was called for a senior government official who asked him to “stall” on compensation payments. As the BBC reports, Sunak did not answer this directly. But he replied:  Kemi made a fulsome statement about this in parliament. She was right to do so and gave, I think, a very clear explanation of everything that’s happened.  In the Commons yesterday Badenoch said that, although she could not prove for certain that the conversation as described by Staunton did not take place, she was prepared to say it didn’t. She explained:  The shadow minister asked whether I would categorically state that no instruction was given to delay payments. Yes, I can. We have no evidence whatever that any official said that. If such a thing was said, it is for Mr Staunton to bring the evidence. It is very hard to refute a negative. People making wild, baseless accusations and then demanding proof that they did not happen are making mischief, in my view. As far as I have seen, all the evidence points to the fact that no one gave that instruction.  In describing Badenoch’s performance as “fulsome”, Sunak seemed to be using the word postively, to mean full or thorough, rather than in its more negative, “proper” sense. This wouldn’t be allowed at the Guardian, where the style guide insists on more precision. This is what it says under the heading “fulsome”.  Not a fancy word for full, it indicates cloying, lavish excess, as in this eloquent description in the London Review of Books, by Rosemary Hill, of books about Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: “His biography was pious to a degree and, like his equally fulsome edition of her letters, much too long.” This sorely misused word is most often seen in the phrase “fulsome praise”, which should not be used in a complimentary sense.      1.52pm GMT  Labour MP Clive Betts, who rebelled on last Gaza ceasefire vote, says he hopes party will unite behind new amendment  The Labour MP Clive Betts, who defied the Labour whip to vote for an SNP amendment calling for a ceasefire in Gaza in November, told the World at One that he was now comfortable with his party’s position. He said he hoped the party would unite behind the amendment tabled today. He said:  [The amendment] goes on to say, and it’s really important this, that we want to work for a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has rejected. So, there’s a major challenge there. We say that the Palestinians have a right to statehood, an inalienable right of the Palestinian people. It’s not in anyone’s gift to allow them to have their own country. That’s a really firm, strong statement, which I think the party will unite behind absolutely. I think many, many people … will see that as a really strong commitment from Labour.      1.40pm GMT   David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has said that he hopes all MPs will unite behind the Labour amendment on Gaza. (See 12.38pm.) Speaking on Radio 4’s the World at One, he said:  We have set down a motion calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. That is because the situation now in Gaza is intolerable, with the dramatic loss of life, with so many people facing starvation, and we are very clear that the Rafah offensive now bein planned cannot go ahead. This is a comprehensive motion, and it’s one that I hope that the whole house can now get behind.      1.33pm GMT  Scott Benton resists call to resign as MP, with statement defending his record and claiming probe procedurally flawed  Scott Benton has issued a long statement to the media about the decision by the IEP to reject his appeal against his 35-day Commons suspension. In it, he does not address Labour’s call for him to resign immediately (see 11.27am), implying he won’t. Instead, he defends his record as an MP. He says:  Since being elected in 2019, I have helped to deliver over £400m in additional government funding for projects in Blackpool – one of the highest amounts in the country. This has funded many different projects including much needed regeneration, upgrades to Blackpool Victoria’s A&E Department, and extra investment in our children’s education. I also recently introduced a new law to strengthen the rights of workers in Blackpool who are often on flexible contracts. Whilst this process has been taking place, I have continued to work tirelessly on behalf of my constituents, recently submitting a petition for regenerating Bond Street & Central Drive, campaigning to restore commercial passenger flights to Blackpool Airport, and fighting to improve local GP and dentistry services. My record of activity, both in Blackpool, and in Westminster, where I am among the most frequent contributors to parliament, speaks for itself.  But the bulk of the statement is a restatement of the case he made in his appeal, arguing that the originally inquiry was procedurally flawed. He focuses in particular on the fact that he was called the day before the standards committee published its report about him by the Times journalist Aubrey Allegretti who knew that the report was coming and seemed to know what it would recommend suspension. Benton says:  Despite the fact that nobody should have known that the report was due to be published – and should certainly not have known its contents – the night before the standards committee decision was issued in December, I took a call from a journalist who knew the outcome and stated that this had come from ‘sources close to the committee’. A recording of this phone call was made and despite having this, and other clear evidence of leaks, the appeal panel and standards committee seek to deny such leaks exist. It goes without saying that the standards process is designed to be open, fair, honest and transparent so the public and MPs can have trust in it. These events clearly mean that this trust has been breached by members of the committee and/or its administrative staff and create an inevitable perception of partiality.  In its report out today, the IEP says it does not accept the contents of the original standards committee report were leaked in advance. It points out that, although Allegretti posted a message on X saying the committee’s report was due to be published the following day (something the committee does not disclose in advance), and that the sanction would pose a “headache” for the Tories, no story about what the report was going to say was published ahead of its publication.     12.56pm GMT  SNP urges all MPs to 'vote with your conscience' and back its motion calling for immediate ceasefire in Gaza  MPs should “vote with your conscience for an immediate ceasefire”, the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has said in a letter to all MPs this afternoon. Urging MPs from all parties to support this “defining vote”, Flynn writes:   No one is pretending this is a simple situation, or that one vote will magically result in a ceasefire overnight – but a ceasefire is more likely to happen if the UK parliament and government join international pressure, than if they fail.  As Labour publishes its amendment to the SNP motion which changes the wording to “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” (see 12.38pm), Flynn goes on in his letter:  I’m sure you will agree, this is a defining vote for any MP. I am therefore urging each and every one of you to vote with your conscience for an immediate ceasefire. I hope Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer will find the courage to change their position and do the only right thing but, if they won’t, it falls to us, MPs of all parties, to show we demand a ceasefire now.That clear statement, and clear intent, is the only message that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government will understand. It is the best pressure we can now apply. By finally joining the vast majority of the international community in pressing for that ceasefire, we can instigate a fresh diplomatic effort to stop the slaughter of even more innocent civilians and children.That diplomatic effort to demand a ceasefire now is the only way to stop the imminent assault on Rafah, secure the unconditional release of all the remaining hostages taken by Hamas, get vital aid into Gaza, and finally put an end to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.      12.38pm GMT  Labour calling for 'immediate humanitarian ceasefire' in Gaza as alternative to SNP's call for 'immediate ceasefire'  Labour is going to table an amendment to the SNP motion on Gaza being debated tomorrow. Emilio Casalicchio from Politico has just posted the wording on X. It is calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. It says this means “an immediate stop to the fighting and a ceasefire that lasts and is observed by all sides”.

Am told to expect an announcement after shadow cabinet, at around midday, on how the party will respond. Labour figures were concerned about committing to voting one way or another until today - fearing if they did so, the SNP could have toughened up the wording ahead of the vote and bounced Labour into then sticking or changing its position. Shadow ministers in recent days have told me they would struggle to abstain on the motion - and are pressing Starmer’s team to back a motion committing to an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza instead of a “permanent ceasefire”. David Lammy at PLP last night assured colleagues he was in listening mode and understood the strength of feeling across the party.   Updated at 2.21pm GMT    12.00pm GMT   No surprise perhaps, but my colleague John Crace was not impressed by Rishi Sunak’s speech to the NFU.

Asked what the government was doing about the barriers farmers have to deal with when trading with EU countries, Sunak replied:  What we’re doing is working very hard with individual countries to ease all those areas where there are differences. I’ll be totally honest, it’s a work in progress. But we are making progress.  As PA Media reports, Sunak said ministers were also in dialogue with the EU on electronic authorisations.     11.48am GMT   There will be an urgent question in the Commons at 12.30pm about the government’s decision to close down the family scheme for Ukrainian refugees. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has tabled the question, and a Home Office minister will reply. Here is Ben Quinn and Rajeev Syal’s story about the move, announced yesterday.   Related: Closure of UK family scheme for Ukrainians described as ‘cruel’ move       11.43am GMT   Labour has been preparing for the byelection in Blackpool South since before Christmas, and has a candidate installed – Chris Webb, who until recently worked in the constituency office of the late Rochdale MP, Tony Lloyd.When the byelection takes place depends on whether Scott Benton digs his heels in and refuses to resign. If he won’t step down, Labour will organise a recall petition, and will need at least 10% of the local electorate to sign it within a six week period. If the 10% threshold is reached, the petition officer informs the speaker of the House of Commons. On the giving of that notice the seat becomes vacant and a byelection is called.“If Scott doesn’t resign and it causes a recall, it lands right on local election day,” said a local campaign source. “If he does resign we are not sure.”     11.33am GMT   With a byelection looming, the Conservatives won’t take much comfort from polling by Deltapoll released last night suggesting Keir Starmer’s lead over Rishi Sunak on the leadership approval index is bigger than ever before.  Net approval for the Prime Minister @RishiSunak has fallen by eight points this week, while approval for @Keir_Starmer is up by five points. pic.twitter.com/zEpL82xcA3— Deltapoll (@DeltapollUK) February 19, 2024   The gap between net approval for Sunak and Starmer is now the widest it has ever been. pic.twitter.com/md3Kv9cXsq— Deltapoll (@DeltapollUK) February 19, 2024      11.27am GMT  Labour says Scott Benton should resign immediately to save Blackpool South constituents lengthy wait for new MP  Labour says Scott Benton should resign immediately to allow a byelection to be held, instead of forcing constituents to wait for the recall petition process to conclude. Benton could be suspended from the Commons within days. After that a recall petition opens. But the petition remains open for six weeks and, unless Benton resigns, the byelection cannot be called until the petition closes and the 10% threshold has been achieved. Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said:  Scott Benton should do the decent thing and resign, saving the people of Blackpool South a lengthy recall petition that would leave them without the representation they deserve. This is yet another byelection caused by Tory scandal. Britain deserves better than this carousel of Conservative Chaos. Labour’s Chris Webb is Blackpool born and bred, and ready to deliver a fresh start for Blackpool South.      11.20am GMT   Here is an extract from the independent expert panel’s report explaining why it has rejected Scott Benton’s appeal against his 35-day Commons suspension.  For the purpose of deciding the appropriate sanction for breaches of the code, the [standards] committee is well-placed for these purposes as an informed and expert body. We will not lightly interfere with their decision on sanction. Under the procedural protocol, we will do so only if the committee’s decision is unreasonable or disproportionate. We do not find that to be the case here.      11.12am GMT  Sunak faces prospect of another byelection defeat after Scott Benton loses appeal against 35-day Commons suspension  Rishi Sunak faces another likely byelection defeat. The Commons independent expert panel, which deals with appeals from MPs accused of misconduct, has rejected an appeal from Scott Benton against a standards committee recommendation saying he should be suspended from the Commons for 35 days for offering to lobby on behalf of the gambling industry. The 35-day suspension will have to be approved by the Commons as a whole, but that will be a formality. And once that has been agreed, because the suspension is longer than 10 days, the Recall Act kicks in, which means that if 10% of voters in the constituency sign a petition calling for a byelection, there will be one. In all recent cases, that 10% threshold has been achieved comfortably. Benton is MP for Blackpool South and he had a majority for the Conservatives of 3,690 at the last election over Labour. Given the current state of polling, this looks like an inevitable Labour win.     11.03am GMT   Sunak is now defending the changes to the way grants are paid to farmers. He says the common agricultural policy, the EU’s grant scheme for farmers, “disproportionately rewarded the largest landowners and held back smaller farmers. He goes on:  It did little for food productivity or the environment. It was far too bureaucratic. Just remember we used to argue about whether a cauliflower and cabbage were the same crop – and you could be fined thousands for a gateway being too wide or a buffer strip too narrow.      11.01am GMT   Sunak starts with a tribute to farmers, saying that as MP for a rural constituency, Richmond in Yorkshire, he knows how hard they work.  I see firsthand the long hours that you work, the weather that you contend with, the family businesses that you support the communities you build. The beautiful countryside, the pastures, the hedgerows, the fields. That would not be the same without you. You do it not for praise or high reward but to put food on our tables, to maintain a tradition and a way of life, and to steward our landscape. It’s part of who we are, and we don’t celebrate you enough. And so, on behalf of the nation, I just wanted to say thank you.      10.58am GMT  Rishi Sunak speaks to NFU conference  Rishi Sunak is addressing the NFU conference now. He starts with a tribute to Minette Batters, saying it will be her last conference as NFU president. He says she has been a forceful voice for farming.  Updated at 11.26am GMT    10.50am GMT   Last week the Country Land and Business Association published the results of a Survation poll showing a huge drop in support for the Tories in rural constituencies. In its summary of the results the CLA said:  The share of the Labour vote has climbed to 37% (up 17 points on the 2019 general election result), with the Conservatives falling to 34% (down 25 points). More respondents believe Labour understands and respects rural communities and the rural way of life than the Conservatives (28% versus 25%). The Conservatives currently hold 96 of the 100 most rural seats, but face losing more than half to Labour and the Lib Dems, including those of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Hunt and Thérèse Coffey.  This, and other polling presenting a similar picture, has led to claims that Rishi Sunak is only speaking at the NFU conference for electoral reasons.  But when this was put to Steve Barclay, the environment secretary, on LBC this morning, he said this was not the case. He told the station:  I worked with the prime minister, I was obviously his deputy in the Treasury, and when he asked me to do this role I was very keen that he did come to the NFU conference. I think it is important to signal that the whole government is absolutely focused on food production and food security. I think the importance of food security has increased given the volatility around the world.  Sunak is the first PM to address an NFU conference since Gordon Brown in 2008.     10.40am GMT  English farmers to be offered ‘largest ever’ grant scheme amid food security concerns  Rishi Sunak will be addressing the NFU conference in Birmingham shortly. As Helena Horton reports, he will promise farmers the “largest ever” grant scheme, as well as the creation of a food security index, after criticism that Brexit trade deals and poor responses to flooding and rising costs have put England’s ability to feed itself at risk.   Related: English farmers to be offered ‘largest ever’ grant scheme amid food security concerns       10.19am GMT  Former Tory minister Nick Boles says he wants Starmer to be PM and will do 'whatever I can' to help Labour succeed  Nick Boles was elected as a Conservative MP in 2010 and he served as a minister under David Cameron. In 2019 he resigned the Tory whip complaining that hardline colleagues were unwilling to accept a compromise over Brexit, and he left the Commons after the subsequent election. Now, as PoliticsHome revealed, he is informally advising Labour. He told the Daily Telegraph:  I hope Keir Starmer is able to form a government after the next election. I want to do whatever I can to help a Labour administration succeed.      9.54am GMT  SNP's Stephen Flynn says US's draft resolution for UN on Gaza ceasefire does not go far enough  Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, has said that a UN security council resolution proposed by the US calling for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza does not go far enough. As Julian Borger reports, the draft UN text “marks the first time the US has explicitly backed a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, though it adds that the temporary truce should be begun ‘as soon as practicable’, leaving some room for manoeuvre by the Israeli military.”   Related: US urges Israel to drop plans for Rafah ground offensive   Asked his view on the draft resolution, Flynn told the BBC this morning:  The problem is that ceasefire is included but the word before it is also important and the word we need to hear before it is immediate because we cannot continue to see civilians being killed, some 30,000 people have been killed since the outbreak of this conflict, 70,000 injured, there’s about 1.4 million people sheltering in Rafah which is normally home to about 170,000 people, those people are under constant bombardment from the Israeli defence force who have stated that they intend to launch a ground offensive on that area in the not too distant future. The death toll could rise exponentially. Enough is enough. We need an immediate ceasefire and that’s what the SNP will continue to champion.  Tomorrow MPs are due to vote on an SNP motion calling for “an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel”. The debate is creating a problem for Labour because many of its MPs support the SNP position, but Keir Starmer has been unwilling to call for an “immediate” ceasefire without an assurance that Hamas would comply. Starmer is also keen as acting like a prime minister in waiting, acting in concert with diplomatic allies, and not just adopting the language of protest movements. In this respect, the shift in US position might give him some cover. At the weekend Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said there had been discussions between SNP and Labour party whips about the vote on Wednesday, but Flynn said this morning that this was not true. He said:  I have had no communication nor has my chief whip with the Labour party, it’s deeply disappointing, and I’m not entirely sure why Anas Sarwar sought to espouse that mistruth, perhaps he was spun a line by Keir Starmer to try and calm him down a little bit, because of course Anas is in support of my position in relation to an immediate ceasefire as I believe most of Scottish Labour are. Ultimately the key thing for me is making sure that we can protect civilian lives and that is what are going to seek to do in the House of Commons tomorrow night.  Although the SNP says its primary concern is saving lives in Gaza, in Scotland it faces its biggest electoral challenge from Labour and tabling a vote on a ceasefire motion allows it to highlight the bitter divisions in the Labour party on this issue.     9.30am GMT  Government under fresh pressure over Post Office Horizon scandal as new cover-up evidence revealed  Good morning. Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, probably left the Commons chamber yesterday afternoon feeling she had done rather well in terms of quashing the allegations made about the government’s handling of the Post Office Horizon scandal. In response to serious claims made by Henry Staunton, the Post Office chair she sacked, she retaliated with blanket, unequivocal denials, scorn and invective, and damning allegations about Staunton’s competence and integrity. Some of these came as a surprise to opposition MPs and, without hard evidence to challenge what Badenoch was saying, their criticisms of her were as a result more muted than they otherwise would have been. But this morning Badenoch’s “win” does not look quite so convincing, and three developments have occured that pose further problems for her and the government. 1) Staunton has hit back, with a lengthy statement in which he says he had not even been told about the bullying allegation against him that Badenoch implied, in her statement to MPs, was a major reason for his dimissal. A spokesperson for Staunton said:  This is the first time the existence of such allegations have been mentioned and Mr Staunton is not aware of any aspect of his conduct which could give rise to such allegations. They were certainly not raised by the Secretary of State at any stage and certainly not during the conversation which led to Mr Staunton’s dismissal. Such behaviour would in any case be totally out of character.  The full Staunton statement is here.

In its story the BBC quotes Paul Marshall, a barrister who acted on behalf of some of the post office operators, saying:  The important feature of all of this is that in 2014, it appears that the Post Office board was alive to the true position - that remote access by Fujitsu was possible. And yet the Post Office board was responsible for maintaining and advancing the Post Office’s defence to the sub-postmasters’ claim in 2019 - that it was impossible. That was false - and, it would appear, known to be so … On the face of it, it discloses a conspiracy by the Post Office to pervert the course of justice.  3) Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, has said that his committee will be demanding evidence from the business department to establish which version of events – Badenoch’s or Staunton’s – is true. Yesterday the committee invited Staunton to give evidence to it next week. And this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, Byrne said the committee would be requesting papers relating to the row, including the email that Staunton said he wrote, and that he believes is still retained on the Post Office’s system, recording the conversation in which he claims he was told by a government official to “stall” Horizon compensation payments. In his interview, Byrne also described the BBC story about the Cameron government knowing that the Post Office realised there was a risk of Horizon terminals being access remotely at a time when it was still defending the prosecution of post office operators who were convicted on the basis of Post Office evidence asserting categorically this was not possible. Byrne said the report seemed to be “the first evidence that we’ve got from quite an early stage that ministers were sighted on just what it was that was going on”. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, gives evidence to the Commons Scottish affairs committee. 10.15am: Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 10.45am: Rishi Sunak gives a speech to the NFU conference. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby conference. 11.30am: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee. Morning: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, carries out further visits on the Falklands Islands. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

What makes economic sense to those of us on the left is, in an election year, unlikely to cut through to an electorate of small-c conservatives, backed by a big-c Conservative press.  Since Margaret Thatcher erroneously equated a national economy with a household budget, borrowing to invest comes up against the mythical creature of national debt. There is a not unjustified sense in the country that whatever economic policy is enacted, the less well-off will pay for it. I suggest that it is inequality that makes cowards of us all.Felicity McGowanCardigan, Ceredigion • When I read Yanis Varoufakis’s article asking why senior Labour politicians are trotting out the line about the Tories maxing out the country’s credit card, I thanked him out loud. A couple of days before, I had listened to Keir Starmer using that phrase during a TV interview and realised that there were only two reasons why anyone would use that analogy: they’re either stupid, or they think the listeners are.Nicky CoatesBristol • Polly Toynbee clings steadfastly to the idea that Labour will do an about-turn as soon as it wins a majority (We’ve heard lots about what Labour won’t do, but here’s something they should: close the Tories’ tax loopholes, 13 February). It is touching to see such undying faith in politicians such as Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, whose role in recent times seems to be walking back, one by one, on any policies that might threaten to change anything. What will it take for people to wake up to the fact that the Labour party’s economic policy is indistinguishable from that of the mainstream centre-right? By voting for Labour, one is voting for fiscal conservatism with a red rosette. Tom KingLondon • Polly Toynbee might find more support for the equalisation of capital gains tax and income tax rates if she acknowledged the importance of reintroducing relief for inflation (abolished in the simplifications introduced by Alastair Darling in 2008), alongside any increase in the CGT rates. The current arrangements are perverse in taxing nominal capital gains made over 24 hours at the same rate as those made over 30 years, with no recognition that much of the gain in the latter may be due to inflation, and no real gain at all.Jeremy FairbrotherTrinity College, Cambridge University • George Monbiot (If disillusionment is all Keir Starmer delivers as prime minister, I fear Labour will shrivel and die, 11 February) is always worth listening to with regard to the state of the nation. But Britain is a place where voters have largely chosen conservatism as a governing principle. We need radicalism, an attitude that seeks out the roots of the issues, rather than a focus on self-interest and short-termism. Rather than trying to persuade politicians to be radical, our campaigns need to be focused on persuading our fellow electors. It’s a longer campaign, but perhaps the only one that will save democracy.Fr Christopher Swift Coreglia Antelminelli, Tuscany, Italy  • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Michael Gove failed to register hospitality he enjoyed with a Conservative donor whose company he had recommended for multimillion-pound personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts during the Covid pandemic, the Guardian can reveal. While still minister for the Cabinet Office, in August 2021 Gove was entertained to VIP hospitality at a Queens Park Rangers (QPR) football match with David Meller, whose fashion products company had been awarded £164m PPE contracts following Gove’s referral in May 2020. MPs’ code of conduct requires them to register all gifts, donations and hospitality above a £300 value, but Gove did not register the hospitality he received at the QPR match, which was organised by Meller’s son, Jonny. When asked by the Guardian about it, a spokesperson for Gove acknowledged he had failed to do so and apologised, saying it had been an “oversight”. The spokesperson said: “Mr Gove is grateful to the Guardian for bringing this matter to his attention. He has written to the relevant parliamentary authorities to inform them of a potential omission from the register of members’ financial interests regarding two complimentary tickets he received from Queens Park Rangers Football Club to a match in August 2021. “Mr Gove routinely declares his attendance at such events in his role as an MP and government minister, as evidenced by other entries in his register of interests and ministerial transparency returns. He apologises for any oversight on his part.” As the Cabinet Office minister responsible for PPE procurement during the pandemic, Gove in May 2020 recommended Meller’s company at the time, Meller Designs, as a potential PPE supplier to the government’s chief commercial officer. The offer was referred to the government’s “VIP lane”, that gave high priority to companies recommended by ministers, Conservative MPs and peers, and officials, and six PPE contracts were awarded worth £164m. Gove’s recommendation of Meller Designs was not yet public knowledge when in August 2021 David and Jonny Meller accompanied Gove and his son to QPR’s first match of the new football season, a 1-1 draw with Millwall. During that week Jonny Meller had contacted one of the QPR owners, Amit Bhatia, saying that Gove had asked to be taken to the match. Jonny Meller inquired if they could pay to have seats in Bhatia’s box, explaining that it could be uncomfortable for Gove if they sat in a general area of the stadium, due to public anger at the government’s handling of the pandemic. Bhatia made his own box available, waiving any payment for it, and Gove and David Meller went to the match with their sons and some other guests. Gove has previously registered football match hospitality: two tickets worth £2,500 from Santander Bank for the European Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City in June 2021; two tickets worth £600 from the Premier League for Chelsea’s April 2022 FA Cup semi-final victory over Crystal Palace at Wembley, and two tickets from the Premier League again in September 2023 for Chelsea’s home match against Aston Villa, valued at £1,342.10. A QPR employee said the club did not attach a price to Bhatia’s box because it is not sold to supporters, but a standard QPR hospitality box for that Millwall match cost £2,750 plus VAT: £3,300. However, Gove did not register the free hospitality tickets on his MP’s register. Meller has been a substantial donor to the Conservative party, his educational charity sponsored academies when Gove was education secretary, and he supported Gove for the party leadership in 2016, donating £3,250 to his unsuccessful campaign. Meller Designs, part of Meller’s family business until it was sold in January 2021, was a wholesaler of own-label fashion accessories to retailers, which in 2019, the year before the pandemic, made a pre-tax profit of less than £200,000. The £164m government PPE contracts boosted its revenues by 1,400% in 2020 and its profit increased to £16m in 2020. Meller and his co-owner then shared dividends of £5m. David Meller did not respond to an invitation to comment. Jonny Meller said he had no recollection of going to the match with Gove and declined to comment further. QPR also declined to comment. A government spokesperson said ministers were not involved in procurement decisions or the awards of contracts during the emergency effort to secure PPE. “Due diligence was carried out on all companies in advance of procurement and every company was subjected to the same checks,” they added."

        "published_date": "2024-02-20T16:11:30+00:00",
        "content": "A former Conservative business secretary has criticised his successors for abandoning industrial strategy, including an “unnecessary act of vandalism” in abolishing a council of industry leaders. Greg Clark said on Tuesday that the UK needed to be “more active and deliberate” in its approach to industry, in testimony to the Commons business and trade committee. Clark was joined by two of his predecessors, Labour’s Peter Mandelson and the Liberal Democrats’ Vince Cable, in bemoaning the lack of a coherent industrial strategy since 2019. The US, EU and Chinese governments have in recent years launched expensive efforts to subsidise and promote their domestic advanced industries, amid increasingly open geopolitical rivalry. All three former business secretaries said the UK was failing to keep up, putting British companies at a disadvantage by failing to match rivals’ industrial strategies and leaving them uncertain over the country’s long-term plans. The criticism of the government by a former Tory business secretary highlights the tensions within the Conservative party about how far it should rely on market forces over government intervention. Clark served as business secretary under the former prime minister Theresa May between 2016 and 2019. He said he tried to build upon work done by Mandelson and Cable to give businesses stability, whereas his successors “abolished the plans”, resulting in “intermittent industrial strategy over many years”. He said: “Just at the time – partly driven by security reasons – that countries have looked to make sure that they can guarantee supplies and prosper in the world, we went through a period of abandoning industrial strategy, which I think was a mistake.” Clark, who still serves as the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, condemned the abolition of the industrial strategy council in 2021, when Kwasi Kwarteng was the business secretary. The council, launched in 2018, had gathered business leaders for regular meetings to discuss government policy. It had included the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, the investor and GB News founder Paul Marshall, the former Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia, and the Marks & Spencer chair, Archie Norman. Clark said: “It was an unnecessary act of vandalism to destroy a new institution that was doing good work.” Mandelson, who served as business secretary between 2008 and 2010 under Gordon Brown, criticised the approach of the business minister, Kemi Badenoch, who has said she does not want the government to try “picking winners”. That phrase is closely associated with the former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher. “[Badenoch’s] living in a different rhetorical era, frankly,” said Mandelson. “She needs to join the 21st century and see what everyone else is doing in this new normal.” Cable, who served as business minister under the coalition government from 2010 to 2015, said international competition from the likes of China would “only intensify”. However, he warned the UK against trying to match the US, a much larger economy. “There’s some danger in thinking you can cut and paste the [Joe] Biden model to the UK,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “Those who say we don’t have a clear strategy in place are not paying attention. We’ve been working hand-in-glove with industry to ensure our plan provides the right support British businesses need.” The spokesperson said the UK had a “historic year” for investment in 2023, including £29bn pledged at the Global Investment Summit, £4.5bn of government support for manufacturing, plus investments from Tata and Nissan."

        "content": "Enter Farmer Rish!. You might have thought Rishi Sunak was a typical member of the globalist metrosexual elite. Sharp suits and sharper elbows as he rode the Goldman Sachs gravy train to bet against sterling. A man whose main connection to the countryside was as a view to be enjoyed from the privacy of his own helicopter. But no. It turns out that the prime minister is a man hewn from the soil. A sheep whisperer whose own circadian rhythms are in tune with the natural world. A politician who likes nothing more than to escape the grime of Westminster infighting to gaze at the unusable flooded fields that surround his constituency home while relaxing in his heated swimming pool. On Tuesday, Sunak became the first prime minister to address the National Farmers’ Union conference since 2008. And only a cynic could possibly imagine it had anything to do with the Conservatives having realised their days of taking the rural vote for granted were long gone. Not to put too fine a point on it, the Tories are in a full-on panic. When they can’t count on the farmers – years of neglect and broken promises have seen to that – then a wipeout is on the cards. So this year, Downing Street was in full love-bombing mode in Birmingham. The entire Defra team had been sent along to occupy the front row for this landmark event. Rish! even had to be dissuaded from going on stage in a brand new tweed suit and wellies. “But I want to show the farmers how much I care,” he had wailed. “To show that I am one of them.” Not sure that will quite cut it, he had been told. Still, Sunak did have something going for him. He wasn’t Thérèse Coffey. Last year, the then environment secretary for whom everything is too much bother had been invited to give the keynote speech. From the Charm School Playbook 101, she had turned up late and then proceeded to insult her audience by telling them to stop moaning and try doing a proper day’s work instead. Coming from her! For the coup de grace, she had announced that she couldn’t be bothered to take questions as she had a train to catch. Sayonara, motherfuckers. The conference had started with a speech from the outgoing president of the NFU, Minette Batters. She went down a storm. She always does. Batters has been a wonderful advocate for farmers over the years and she got an extended standing ovation. And no one clapped harder than Rish!. Because at heart he too was a farmer and he wanted to personally thank her for all she had done. Minette looked rather taken aback. Not sure whether to milk his applause or to wipe his residue from her suit jacket. “Good afternoon, everyone,” Sunak began. Which was curious as the time was shortly after 11 in the morning. Maybe he had just flown in from his megafarm in Poland where he had been doing the milking before breakfast and his watch was still on eastern European time. But everyone was too polite to point out his error, so Rish! slid easily into his rural fantasia. He loved farmers. He loved farming. The countryside nourished his soul. He liked nothing better of a weekend than to walk o’er hill and dale with only a ploughman’s lunch for sustenance as he recited Wordsworth’s Prelude to himself. “So thank you, farmers” and “I love you, Minette”. Then Sunak put on his serious face. He knew that farmers had been having a difficult time. No one felt their pain more than he did. But he was going to make things better for them. Put right the damage caused both by the war in Ukraine and climate change. So let’s cut to the chase. He was going to offer them a bribe. He had mysteriously found an extra £220m from down the back of the sofa – don’t tell Labour this trick – and everyone was going to get a share. Everyone would be a winner. Food security and supply chain issues would be solved at a stroke. “You can trust the Conservatives,” he said. A strange choice of language when you’re openly offering financial inducements. Not generally a sign of someone’s trustworthiness. “I have your back.” But was it enough for the farmers to have Sunak’s back? Had they been bought off? From the barely polite smattering of applause that followed his speech, I’d guess not. There was then a brief question and answer session with Batters. No press questions were allowed and only two, pre-vetted questions from members of the audience. It was almost as if Sunak was terrified of getting ambushed. Had only agreed to come providing Minette took care of him. Took pity on him. He still seemed to be under the illusion that he was the one doing the farmers a favour by turning up to give a dull 10-minute speech. And Batters did look after Sunak. Normally the NFU president is a terrier, completely uncowed by government ministers. She had almost ended Coffey’s career. But now she went out of her way not to ask anything tricky. To not probe too deeply. To allow non-answers to go unchallenged. This didn’t go down well with her audience. One farmer said it was an insult to them. So the disastrous effect of Brexit on farming almost got missed. “It’s been a difficult period,” was all Rish! had to say on the subject. Really? This from a man who had sold Brexit as the golden ticket for all farmers. Surely Minette could at least have asked him to say sorry. All that Brexit has done for most farmers is leave them close to bankruptcy. Instead the farmers were expected to be thrilled with scraps. A deal worth almost nothing with New Zealand. A frozen foods bonanza with Sweden. Sunak was dying on his feet and Batters was letting him get away with it. He even got panicked into mumbling about lettuces. The last thing anyone wanted was a reminder of Liz Truss. We were only seconds away from reliving Theresa May running through a wheat field. Nor did Rish! have anything to say about farmers going uncompensated for allowing their fields to store floodwater. He was also silent on the ditching of a report entitled Pathways to Success for hill farmers after the investigators concluded there were no pathways. The Tory record on farming is a shocker and Batters let Sunak get away with it. Rish! couldn’t wait to go. He had said too much. He hadn’t said enough. Just one last indulgence of his bucolic idyll. Nothing touched him more than to hear the oxen lowing among the verdant leas. There was a dry eye everywhere."

        "content": "Labour has called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza for the first time in an attempt to head off what threatens to be the biggest rebellion against Keir Starmer since he became party leader. Opposition whips published a 237-word amendment to a Scottish National party motion on Tuesday setting out the party’s stance on the Middle East crisis, which they hope Labour MPs will back instead of a separate amendment from the SNP calling more bluntly for an immediate ceasefire. The Labour wording goes further than the party has in the past in calling for a ceasefire. Last weekend, Starmer said he wanted the fighting to “stop now”, but he has been reluctant to back an immediate and permanent ceasefire given that Hamas has threatened to carry out further attacks like the one on 7 October.   Related: Keir Starmer risks biggest rebellion of his leadership over Gaza vote, MPs warn   While the amendment backs a “humanitarian ceasefire”, it clarifies that it does not want Israel to stop fighting as long as Hamas continues to threaten violence. The amendment calls for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, which means an immediate stop to the fighting and a ceasefire that lasts and is observed by all sides, noting that Israel cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence and that Israelis have the right to the assurance that the horror of 7th October cannot happen again”. It also calls on the Israelis not to enter Rafah, where 1.5 million people are sheltering; for aid to be allowed to enter Gaza; for Israeli settler violence to end, and for a diplomatic effort towards a two-state solution. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “This is a comprehensive motion and one that I hope the whole house can get behind.” Labour’s amendment, which will be put to a vote on Wednesday, is designed to head off the type of rebellion the party suffered in November, when 56 Labour MPs, including eight frontbenchers, defied Starmer’s orders not to vote for a similar SNP motion. Labour MPs have said in recent days that there could be an even bigger rebellion this week if Labour whips try again to prevent them voting for a ceasefire. Initial reactions suggested the party’s shift in policy would be enough to persuade some of those who rebelled last year not to do so again. But it remained unclear what Labour would do if the amendment failed to pass. Clive Betts, one of dozens of Labour backbenchers who voted for the SNP motion last time, told the BBC’s World at One: “It is a revised and good position. I don’t think anyone can see the horrors of what is happening now in Gaza and not want the fighting to stop, and stop immediately. That is what the Labour motion says.” Another Labour source said: “The amendment looks good, but we’ll have to see how they handle the vote on Wednesday.” The shift in Labour’s position comes amid a similar change in international opinion towards events in Gaza. The US on Monday proposed a UN security council resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire and urging Israel not to go ahead with a planned offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza. The draft resolution marks the first time Washington has explicitly backed a ceasefire in the region, though it also says it should begin “as soon as practicable”, rather than immediately. Meanwhile the Prince of Wales called for the fighting to end “as soon as possible” and for more humanitarian support for Gaza. Prince William issued a statement before carrying out visits to recognise the human suffering caused by conflict in the Middle East and the global rise in antisemitism.  “I remain deeply concerned about the terrible human cost of the conflict in the Middle East since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7. Too many have been killed,” he said. “I, like so many others, want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible. There is a desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza. It’s critical that aid gets in and the hostages are released. “Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home. “Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair. I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”"

But if current polling holds true some big names could be set to leave parliament, such as Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green, who has a majority of three points.\nSome Tories are in safe seats: a massive swing of 24.5 percentage points would be required to flip Priti Patel’s majority of 49 percentage points in her Essex seat of Witham, for example. Suella Braverman in Fareham and Waterlooville is also currently safe, with a swing of 21 percentage points needed to overcome her majority of 42 points.\nTo understand the connection between swing and majority, it is important to remember that a swing from the Conservatives to Labour has a powerful double effect: Labour win votes, and the Conservatives lose them. That is why swing can overturn a majority of double its size.\nThe table below shows the Conservative-held seats that are most at risk with the direct swing to Labour that the polls are currently indicating. This Guardian analysis assumes that direct swing will be applied uniformly across the country, regardless of local or other factors that would influence voting behaviour on election day, and excludes the impact of third parties.\n \n\n   default\n  \n\n\nThese seats are the new constituencies in which the new general election will be fought, after the latest constituency boundary review.\nLabour has a steep hill to climb from its 2019 result if it wants to win the election and this analysis demonstrates how crucial it is for the party to persuade people who voted Tory in the last election to back Labour.\nConvincing voters to switch allegiance from the Conservatives directly to Labour can be more effective than focusing on winning votes from third parties.\nThis interactive explains why that is.\n \n\n   default\n  \n\n\nMethodology\nPolling: Our poll numbers are taken from the Guardian’s poll tracker. This uses a unweighted 10-day rolling average of polls approved by the British Polling Council and where possible, excludes respondents who said they don’t know how they will vote.\nNew constituency boundaries: UK constituency boundaries were changed in 2023, with constituencies changing size, name or ceasing to exist. To make the 2019 results a meaningful comparison for 2024, we are using the results of the 2019 election reprojected on to the new boundaries, giving an indication of the results as they would have been if that election had been run on the current boundaries. This piece explains the new constituency boundaries and allows you to find your new seat.\nDirect swing: For the purposes of this article we are assuming uniform national swing — that changes at a national level will be played out in the same way across all constituencies. This is a simplified model that does not account for variation in individual constituencies or the effects of other parties.\nThe calculation behind direct swing, based on current polling numbers, is as follows:\n\nFind the change between Labour and the Conservatives’ vote share in 2019 and their predicted 2024 vote share, according to the latest polls.\nAdd these two numbers together and divide them by two.\nIf Labour went up 10 and Conservatives went down 15, that would be 10+15 / 2, indicating a swing of 12.5 points. We know the swing is in Labour’s favour because Labour is up and the Conservatives are down.\n"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak may face another difficult byelection after an MP lost his appeal against a 35-day suspension from parliament for offering to lobby ministers on behalf of the gambling industry. Scott Benton, the MP for Blackpool South, formerly a Conservative, had asked for a reconsideration of the standards committee verdict that he had committed an “extremely serious breach of the rules”. Benton had offered to lobby ministers on behalf of the gambling industry and leak a confidential policy document for up to £4,000 a month, which the committee found merited a suspension of 35 days, subject to a parliamentary vote. Undercover reporters for the Times posing as representatives of a fake investment fund had approached the MP, who told them he could “call in favours” from colleagues and get “easy access” to ministers when queueing for parliamentary votes. The Commons standards committee said at the time that the message he gave to the undercover reporters was “that he was corrupt and ‘for sale’, and that so were many other members of the house”. “He communicated a toxic message about standards in parliament. We condemn Mr Benton for his comments, which unjustifiably tarnish the reputation of all MPs.” Benton appealed on the grounds that the procedure was flawed, claiming the decision was leaked by the committee. This was dismissed by the independent expert panel, which hears challenges to the watchdog’s findings. If the Commons backs the punishment, it could leave Benton – who was stripped of the Conservative whip after the allegations surfaced – facing a byelection. Blackpool South is one of the “red wall” seats, having backed the Labour party from the 1997 election until Benton’s win in 2019. It is one of the most deprived areas in England. Labour has selected the leftwing trade unionist Chris Webb as its prospective parliamentary candidate for the seat, which Keir Starmer’s party believes it can win. A party spokesperson called on Benton to resign immediately rather than wait for the outcome of any recall petition. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, said: “Scott Benton should do the decent thing and resign, saving the people of Blackpool South a lengthy recall petition that would leave them without the representation they deserve. “This is yet another byelection caused by Tory scandal. Britain deserves better than this carousel of Conservative chaos. “Labour’s Chris Webb is Blackpool born and bred, and ready to deliver a fresh start for Blackpool South.” Labour has comfortably won byelections in Wellingborough, Kingswood, Rutherglen, Tamworth, Selby, Wakefield and Mid Bedfordshire in recent times."

        "content": "Overseas elections from more than 30 years ago are rarely hot topics of conversation in modern UK politics. But whisper “Canada 1993” into a Conservative MP’s ear and don’t be surprised if they break into a sudden cold sweat. This is the model for the “extinction-level event” experienced by a previously dominant rightwing party – one that some Tory opponents of Rishi Sunak warn he risks emulating at the next general election. The basic and, for Tory MPs, chilling facts are that in October 1993 the Progressive Conservative party, in power in Canada since 1984, slumped from 167 federal seats to just two, eventually leading to its dissolution and merger into the new Conservative party of Canada. There are some curiously precise parallels: a complacent conservative incumbent that had recently ditched its leader (Kim Campbell replacing Brian Mulroney) was struggling with the economy and faced a new, insurgent rightwing party – called Reform. Arguably the most pertinent common ground is the fact that Canada, like Westminster, uses first past the post (FPTP), a system that can greatly distort the way votes translate into numbers of MPs – in 1993 the Progressive Conservatives got 16% of the vote and ended up with less than 1% of the seats. Could this happen here? Some on the right of the UK Conservatives, who want Sunak to more closely follow Reform UK’s harder-right populism on areas such as immigration, argue that without a change, of course it could. Such warnings have grown since last week’s byelection losses in Wellingborough and Kingswood, previously Conservative seats won by Labour after a collapse in the Tory vote and Reform winning 13% and 10% respectively in each seat. The scenario that more doom-laden Tories fear could tip a general election defeat into a calamity would be a further slip in the polls and Nigel Farage deciding to retake the helm of Reform before the election, boosting its support among disenchanted voters on the right. It is certainly true that while a post-election tally of two feels unrealistic, the vagaries of FPTP means it would not take a massive shift in polling for the total number of Tory MPs to drop dramatically. The votes-to-seats modeller on the Electoral Calculus website shows that at current polling levels – 27% for the Conservatives, 43% for Labour, 10% for the Liberal Democrats, 9% for Reform, 7% for the Greens – the Conservatives would be reduced to 179 MPs. However, in a scenario where Labour’s vote share increased by one percentage point to 44%, the Tories’ fell to 20%, with the other six points moving to Reform (now on 14%) and the Lib Dems (13%), and the Greens still on 7%, could result in just 55 Conservative MPs. Such FPTP distortions can be amplified further by particularly efficient tactical voting and the vagaries of where votes are distributed. There are a number of significant differences from Canada in 1993, however, including the near disappearance of the Progressive Conservatives’ representation in Quebec amid the rise of the separatist Bloc Québécois. In contrast, the Conservatives start at an already lower base in Scotland and, to an extent, Wales. Overall, most pundits do not believe a Canada-style wipeout will happen. “Never say never about anything in politics,” said Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and psephologist. “But the only people who mention it are those who have a vested interest in exaggerating the potential for a possible defeat.” Lord Hayward thinks it is unlikely that the Tories will win fewer than 100 seats, arguing that the rise of Reform could hamper Lib Dem appeal for anti-Tory protest voters. “I could foresee circumstances where something like that could happen. Do I think it will happen? No,” he said. Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe and a professor of European politics at King’s College London, co-authored a 2022 study that examined the parallels with 1993. He argued that the situations were sufficiently different. “On one level, anything’s possible,” he said. “My hunch is that the polls will narrow as we get to the election. With the Canadian case, you had a far stronger splintering of the right than we seem to have now, even with Reform’s performance last week. “The other thing you’ve got to factor in, which builds into this uncertainty, is there is eye-watering levels of volatility amongst the British voting public at the moment, compared to any historical period. “Some basic facts seem to me self-evident, which is that the Tories are in a really bad position and are heading towards a bad electoral defeat. But whether it’s what they call an extinction-level event, I doubt, to be honest.”"

        "content": "\n 8.30pm GMT \nEvening summary\n\n\nKemi Badenoch has accused the Post Office chair she sacked of a “blatant attempt to seek revenge” after he made explosive allegations about the government’s handling of the Horizon scandal. The business secretary launched an extended attack on Henry Staunton in the Commons on Monday, and claimed that he was under investigation for bullying when she fired him.\nThe extraordinary war of words began over the weekend after Staunton gave an interview to the Sunday Times accusing the government of wanting to stall compensation payments to victims of the Horizon scandal until after the general election. Badenoch dismissed Staunton from his role last month. In his interview Staunton said that Badenoch told him when she fired him: “Well, someone’s got to take the rap for this.” He also claimed that soon after starting his role in December 2022, he was instructed by a senior civil servant to delay compensation payouts so the Conservatives could “limp into” the general election.\nHenry Staunton issued a stinging riposte to Kemi Badenoch on Monday night, saying he had kept a record of the alleged comment from a senior civil servant asking him to stall compensation payments to Horizon victims. A spokesperson for Staunton said he “recorded [it] at the time in a file note, which he emailed to himself and to colleagues and which is therefore traceable on the Post Office server”. The spokesperson said Staunton had never been made aware of any bullying allegations against him and that they were “certainly not raised by the secretary of state at any stage and certainly not during the conversation which led to Mr Staunton’s dismissal. Such behaviour would in any case be totally out of character.”\nA Foreign Office minister has ruled out a prisoner swap for the imprisoned Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza, a British citizen, who MPs have expressed concern about after the death of Alexei Navalny. Kara-Murza’s wife was now adamant that she wanted everything to be done to get her her husband out of Russia, said the Conservative backbencher Bob Seely, who urged the government to countenance swapping imprisoned spies for the pro-democracy activist who was now the most high-profile Russian political prisoner. Seely, who is in contact with the Kara-Murza and Navalny families, said when he had discussed prisoners swaps with the Foreign Office it had been made clear to him that such moves only encouraged state hostage taking.\nKeir Starmer risks triggering the biggest rebellion of his leadership if he tries to stop his MPs voting on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, backbenchers have warned. Labour MPs are urging their leader not to whip them against voting for a Scottish National party motion this week calling for a ceasefire, three months after a similar vote saw 56 members rebel, including eight frontbenchers. Party whips have not yet decided how to approach Wednesday’s vote, but several MPs have told the Guardian they risk another damaging internal row if they try to oppose it.\nHumza Yousaf has accused Labour of behaving like Margaret Thatcher by throwing oil and gas workers “on the scrapheap”, as he announced the Scottish National party would not back proposals for extending the fossil fuel windfall tax. In a campaign speech delivered in Aberdeen, the UK’s oil capital, Scotland’s first minister accused Labour of risking 100,000 jobs after Keir Starmer promised a “proper” windfall tax on oil and gas firms this month when he scaled back his party’s £28bn green investment pledge.\nA scheme allowing Ukrainians to join family members taking sanctuary in the UK has been unexpectedly closed, in what opposition politicians described as a cruel and “below the radar” move days before the two-year anniversary of Russia’s full invasion. The Ukraine family scheme is being shut but government officials said a separate Homes for Ukraine scheme would continue to fulfil people’s needs as a way of “simplifying” the process.\nChildren’s services leaders have called for a national “plan for childhood” to transform the health, emotional wellbeing and life chances of a generation of youngsters scarred by austerity and the pandemic. In a withering assessment of the government’s record over the past few years, they said ministers had presided over deepening child poverty, crumbling schools and an exploding health and wellbeing crisis in young people, with low-income families worst affected.\nIsrael has gone “beyond reasonable self-defence” in its attack on Gaza, a Labour frontbencher has said, as the party prepares for a potentially difficult Commons vote on the crisis later this week. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said it was possible that Israel had broken international law in its military campaign, which has killed more than 28,000 people in Gaza since the 7 October massacre of Israelis by Hamas.\nOfcom has launched an investigation into whether a GB News programme where Rishi Sunak took questions from the public breached impartiality rules by failing to include other political views. The broadcast watchdog said it had received 500 complaints about People’s Forum: The Prime Minister, held in County Durham on 12 February on Monday last week.\nThe UK’s chief inspector of borders and immigration has said it is “scandalous” that his watchdog role could be left vacant while the Rwanda scheme is introduced. In a break with the treatment of his predecessors, David Neal has been told he will not serve a second term as chief inspector of borders and immigration. The Times reported that a successor was unlikely to be appointed for at least six months, covering the period when the prime minister has said he hopes the first flights carrying asylum seekers to Rwanda will take off.\n\nThat’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along.\nIf you want to carry on following all the latest news from Westminster and beyond, see here.\n\n\n\n 8.15pm GMT \n\nHenry Staunton issued a stinging riposte to Kemi Badenoch on Monday night, saying he had kept a record of the alleged comment from a senior civil servant asking him to stall compensation payments to Horizon victims. \nA spokesperson for Staunton said he “recorded [it] at the time in a file note, which he emailed to himself and to colleagues and which is therefore traceable on the Post Office server”.\nThe spokesperson said Staunton had never been made aware of any bullying allegations against him and that they were “certainly not raised by the secretary of state at any stage and certainly not during the conversation which led to Mr Staunton’s dismissal. Such behaviour would in any case be totally out of character.”\nThey added: “It was in the interests of the business as well as being fair for the postmasters that there was faster progress on exoneration and that compensation for wrongly convicted postmasters was more generous, but we didn’t see any real movement until after the Mr Bates programme. We will leave it to others to come to the conclusion as to why that was the case.”\n\n\n\n 8.04pm GMT \n\nEarlier this evening, the Conservative MP Lee Anderson accused Labour MPs of supporting “the disgraced Post Office management team” during questions to business secretary Kemi Badenoch over the dismissal of Henry Staunton.\nThe MP for Ashfield told the Commons:\n\nI am absolutely staggered that the Labour Party now seem to be coming out in support of the disgraced Post Office management team. This by the way is the same management team that oversaw the wrongful imprisonment of postmasters across the country, hundreds of convictions.\nSo does (Badenoch) agree with me that when push comes to shove that that lot over there would take the side of the grifters not the grafters?\n\nBadenoch responded:\n\nThis is one of the reasons as he said where the Post Office leadership had overseen the wrongful convictions, we have had multiple changes and this is just the latest to ensure that we get the right leadership in place.\nBut as we can see, I know that some of the members opposite are dealing with this properly, but from the heckling we can see that for a lot of them they came here thinking that they could get political points scored and I am not allowing that to happen.\n\n\n\n\n 7.37pm GMT \n\nIn a low-key visit away from the cameras, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron paid his respects at the Argentine military cemetery, PA Media reported.\nThe cemetery holds the remains of more than 230 of the 649 Argentinians killed in the conflict.\n\n\n\n 7.11pm GMT \n\nLabour MP Chris Bryant asked business secretary Kemi Badenoch if she leaked information on the dismissal of Henry Staunton to the media prior to Staunton being himself informed.\n“Can I just clarify something about the process of (Staunton’s) dismissal, as I understand it he found out about it from Sky News, I think the Secretary of State just added a piece of information which is that she then rang Sky News, before ringing him I think, to try and get them to stop running it. So she knew that this had already been leaked to Sky News from somebody in her department presumably,” he said.\n“What investigation did she go through to find out who that was, that leaked it, is that person still in post, because otherwise one might just worry that it might have been she herself who leaked it.”\nBadenoch said: “I knew that someone would ask that question.\n“I have in fact evidence to show that I asked Sky News not to run the story. Of course I didn’t leak it because if I had it would have created legal risk if he (Staunton) found out on the news before I had had a chance to speak to him.\n“We have no idea how Sky News found out the information, there are several thousand people who work in the Department for Business and Trade, there are many more who work at the Post Office, at UKGI.\n“Bryant) is heckling but the point I am making is that leaks are incredibly damaging and harmful, they create legal risks for the department, I did not do so, I made multiple efforts with at least two media outlets to make sure that they did not create problems for Mr Staunton and it is one of the reasons why it is very disappointing to see what he did in the Sunday Times at the weekend.”\n\n\n\n 6.32pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak told his cabinet “we cannot be complacent” about Russia - and the UK together with allies must “intensify” support for Ukraine, in a meeting on Monday.\nA Number 10 readout said: \n\nThe prime minister led a cabinet discussion, ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He made clear that Putin’s actions remain an existential threat to the very foundations of Euro-Atlantic security and that today, just as much as two years ago, he must not be allowed to succeed.\nThe prime minister added that two years in, Putin is not winning. Ukraine has re-opened the Black Sea to exports, and Russia has lost over half the territory it originally captured thanks to Ukraine’s combat power.\nHowever, he added we cannot be complacent. He said the UK would remain at the forefront of the international response - building on our leadership as the first to deliver lethal aid, to commit to provide western battle tanks and fighter pilot training, and to sign the historic UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation in January. And backed by our commitment of £2.5 billion in military aid this year, our largest package yet, and our 100-year partnership with Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n 6.15pm GMT \n\nIt is right to describe Alexei Navalny’s death as murder, a Foreign Office minister has said.\nLeo Docherty agreed with the description of the Russian opposition leader’s death after Alicia Kearns, the Conservative chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee said:\n\nAlexei Navalny was murdered and it is important that we in this House call it out for what it was, because that is what he deserves.\nFollowing his murder, I was also in Munich, where I heard his wife, Yulia, (Navalnaya) ask us to stand by her. That is what we must now do.\n\nShe urged the USA to follow through on warnings it would act if Navalny were to die, adding:\n\nBiden must now deliver on that threat or we will see more lives taken such as that of Vladimir Kara-Murza.\n\nDocherty replied:\n\nShe is right to use the word murder. We do seek to hold the state and the Russian leadership to account.\nOf course I can’t comment on the American position but with regard to our policy with regard to Russian state assets, we will continue to look at the appropriate legal path to ensuring that which is frozen might be utilised to bring benefit to those affected by this outrageous and illegal war in Ukraine.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.17pm GMT\n\n\n 6.05pm GMT \nDavid Cameron visits Falkland Islands\n\nDavid Cameron has become the first foreign secretary to visit the Falkland Islands in 30 years, in a high-profile demonstration the contested territory is a “part of the British family”, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nCameron said that the archipelago’s sovereignty is “not… up for discussion” while the islanders wish to be British, despite fresh calls from Argentina for talks on the future of the islands.\nThe foreign secretary arrived at Mount Pleasant airbase and will visit some of the key battle sites of the 1982 Falklands War to pay his respects to those who lost their lives in the conflict.\nArgentina’s president, Javier Milei, who met Cameron last month, has called for the South Atlantic islands to be handed over to Buenos Aires.\nBut ahead of his arrival in the UK overseas territory, Cameron said: “The Falkland Islands are a valued part of the British family, and we are clear that as long as they want to remain part of the family, the issue of sovereignty will not be up for discussion.”\n\nThat is all from me for today. Tom Ambrose is now taking over.\n\n\n\n 6.00pm GMT \n\nThe war of words on the SNP’s Gaza vote continued today, with Labour’s Scottish secretary Ian Murray telling BBC Radio Scotland this evening that no decision has been taken on whether his party will support Wednesday’s motion. \nThe UK party is desperate to avoid another rebellion on the issue, as happened last November over a similar SNP vote, and led to the resignation of eight frontbenchers.\nMurray said the actual motion had not yet been laid, and added that the SNP should be spending it’s time trying to persuade the government to support them. \nMurray also insisted there was “a cigarette paper between” the motion Scottish Labour conference voted for on Saturday, calling for an immediate ceasefire, and Starmer’s call at the same conference on Sunday for the fighting to “stop now”. \nBut the SNP is continuing to ramp up the pressure on Labour, with Westminster leader Stephen Flynn continuing to offer a meeting to Labour leader Keir Starmer to discuss the vote, but stressing the aim of an immediate ceasefire must not be watered down.\n\n\n\n 5.53pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons the Labour MP Diana Johnson said that what was happening with compensation to victims of the infected blood scandal made it easy to believe that the government was also delaying the payment of compensation to victims of the Post Office scandal. She said:\n\nThe allegations of limping towards the general election in terms of delaying compensation payments to postmasters does actually mirror the behaviour of government towards the infected blood scandal.\nIt seems to me that there is a pattern of behaviour. The government only seem to act when forced to or shamed … into taking any action.\n\nIn response, Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, replied:\n\nNo, no and no.\nI think it’s a shame that [Johnson] would stand up there and say that the government only acted when it was forced to, when she knows that we brought legislation to this House well before the ITV drama.\n\n\n\n\n 5.44pm GMT \n\nDuring her statement to MPs Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, claimed that she had done all she could to stop the news about Henry Staunton being sacked being reported before he found out himself. She said it was “disappointing” that Sky News and the Daily Mail found out what was happening. She said:\n\nIt was also disappointing because I had done everything I could to try and keep this out of the news and do it behind closed doors properly.\nI made sure, when I gave public statements, that I said I wouldn’t do HR in public. I even, when I found out that it had been leaked to Sky News, called Sky News and asked them, one of my assistants did, to ask them not to put that out in the public domain before I had a chance to speak to Henry Staunton – did the same with the Daily Mail who thankfully did listen.\nWe also need the media to help us in this and not publish false allegations.\n\n\n\n\n 5.27pm GMT \nForeign Office minister says government 'working at pace' on sanction options for those involved in death of Alexei Navalny\n\nIn the Commons Leo Docherty, a Foreign Office minister, is now making a statement about the death of Alexei Navalny.\nHe told MPs the government was appalled at the news of Navalny’s death and that he was speaking for the whole house in sending his deepest condolences to Navalny’s family. He went on:\n\nMr Navalny dedicated his life with great bravery to exposing corruption. He called for free and fair politics and held the Kremlin to account. He was an inspiration to millions and many Russians felt that gave them a voice.\nThe Russian authorities saw him as a threat. President Putin fear to even speak his name Putin’s Russia imprisoned him on fabricated charges, poisoned him, and sent him to an Arctic penal colony.\nMr Navalny was a man of huge courage and iron will. Even from his remote prison so he persisted in advocating for the rights of the Russian people.\nNo one should doubt the dreadful nature of the Russian system. Years of mistreatment at the hands of the state at a serious effect on Mr Navalny’s health. His death must be investigated fully and transparently.\n\nDocherty said the Russian authorities should tell Navalny’s family where his body is.\nThe UK government held the Russian authorities “wholly responsible”, he said.\nAnd, in a reference to possible sanctions, he said that the people to blame should be held to account and that the government was “working at pace” on options to enable this to happen.\n\nUpdated at 5.50pm GMT\n\n\n 5.09pm GMT \n'A blatant attempt to seek revenge' – how Badenoch hit back at claims made by ex-Post Office chair\n\nIn her opening statement Kemi Badenoch said that Henry Staunton’s claims in his Sunday Times article were “completely false”. In particular, she addressed three of his specific claims, relating to briefings the media, why he was sacked, and claims compensation was delayed.\n\nBadenoch rejected claims that the media had been pre-briefed about his sacking. She said:\n\n\nMr Staunton alleges that I refused to apologise to him after he learned of his dismissal from Sky News. That was not the case.\nIn the call he referenced I made it abundantly clear that I disapproved of the media briefing any aspect of this story and out of respect for Henry Staunton’s reputation I went to great pains to make my concerns about his conduct private.\nIn fact in my interviews with the press I repeatedly said that I refused to carry out HR in public. That is why it is so disappointing that he’s chosen to spread a series of falsehoods, provide made up anecdotes to journalists and leak discussions held in confidence.\nAll of this merely confirms in my mind that I made the correct decision in dismissing him.\n\n\nShe said Staunton was not sacked because, as he claimed she told him, someone had to take the rap for the Horizon scandal. She said:\n\n\nMr Staunton claimed I told him that someone’s got to take the rap for the Horizon scandal, and that was the reason for his dismissal. That was not the reason at all.\nI dismissed him because there were serious concerns about his behaviour as chair, including those raised from other directors on the board. My department found significant governance issues, for example, with the recruitment of a new senior independent director to the Post Office board. A public appointment process was under way, but Mr Staunton apparently wanted to bypass it, appointing someone from within the existing board without due process.\nHe failed to properly consult the Post Office board on the proposal. He failed to hold the required nominations committee. Most importantly, he failed to consult the government as a shareholder which the company was required to do.\nI know that honourable members will agree with me is such a cavalier approach to governance was the last thing we needed in the Post Office given its historic failings.\n\nIn his Sunday Times interview Staunton addressed this claim, arguing that he was backing the candidate favoured by the board, when the government wanted its own candidate to get the job. (See 4.07pm.)\n\nShe said that Staunton was failing to cooperate with an investigation into allegations of bullying against him. She said:\n\n\nI should also inform the house that, while he was post, a formal investigation was launched into allegations made regarding Mr Staunton’s conduct. This included serious matters such as bullying.\nConcerns were brought to my department’s attention about Mr Staunton’s willingness to cooperate with that investigation.\nSo it is right that the British public knew the facts behind this case, and what was said in the phone call where I dismissed Mr Staunton.\n\n\nShe said she was publishing a readout of her conversation with Staunton. She said:\n\n\nToday I am depositing a copy of that readout in both libraries of the house so the honourable members and the public can see the truth. Personal information relating to other post office employees in those minutes have been redacted.\n\n\nShe said there was “no evidence whatsoever” to support Staunton’s claim that an official told him to stall compensation payments. She said:\n\n\nMr Staunton claimed that when he was first appointed as chair of the Post Office he was told by senior civil servants to stall on paying compensation. There is no evidence whatsoever that this is true.\nIn fact, on becoming Post Office chair, Mr Staunton received a letter from the BEIS [Deparment of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy] permanent secretary, Sarah Munby, on 9 December 2022. It welcomed him to his role, making it crystal clear that successfully reaching settlements with victims of the Post Office scandal should be one of his highest priorities …\nThe reality is that my department has done everything it can to speed up compensation payments for victims. We’ve already made payments totaling £160m across all three compensation schemes. That includes our announcement last autumn of the optional £600,000 pound fixed-sum award for those who’ve been wrongfully convicted. It is the strongest refutation of those who would claim that we only acted after the ITV drama.\n\n\nShe said that all 2,417 post office operators who claimed through the original Horizon shortfall scheme have now had offers of compensation. In total, around £1bn has been committed to ensure wronged post office operators can be compensated, she said.\n\n\nShe said Staunton’s claims were a disgrace. She said:\n\n\nIn short we are putting our money where our mouth is and our shoulders to the wheel and ensuring that justice is done. It is not fair on the victims of this scandal, which has already ruined so many lives and livelihoods, to claim, as Mr Staunton has done, that this has been dragged out a second longer than it ought to be.\nFor Henry Staunton to suggest otherwise, for whatever personal motives, is a disgrace and it risks damaging confidence in the compensation schemes which ministers and civil servants are working so hard to deliver.\nI would hope the most people reading the interview in yesterday, Sunday, Sunday Times, we’ll see it for what it was a blatant attempt to seek revenge following dismissal.\n\n\nAnd she defended her decision to hit back at him so robustly. She said:\n\n\nI must say I regret the way in which these events have unfolded. We did everything we could to manage this dismissal in a dignified way for Mr Staunton and others. However, I will not hesitate to defend myself, and more importantly, my officials, who cannot respond directly to these baseless attacks.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.38pm GMT\n\n\n 4.39pm GMT \n\nBadenoch says, until the day he was fired, Henry Staunton never complained to her about interference by UKGI (UK Government Investments) in the work of his board.\n\n\n\n 4.38pm GMT \n\nBadenoch says UKGI and the Post Office have both denied the claim that UKGI was behind the move by the Post Office’s board to send a letter to the justice deparment suggesting that some of the post office operators who claim to be innocent may in fact be guilty.

She suggests he has made it up.\n\n\n\n 4.33pm GMT \n\nBadenoch is responding to Reynolds.\nShe says she can deny that the government asked the Post Office to stall compensation payments. There is no evidence to show this was said, she says. She says it is hard to prove a negative. But she says there would have been no reason to do this anyway. It would not have affected revenues.\nShe says the department publishes information regularly on what compensation payments have been made.\nShe says she will not publish all her department’s correspondence with the Post Office. She says the inquiry has been set up to investigate this.\nBut she suggests correspondence might be published relating to the claims made by Staunton.\nUPDATE: Badenoch said:\n\nThere would be no benefit whatsoever of us delaying compensation. This does not have any significant impact on revenues whatsoever. It would be a mad thing to even suggest, and the compensation scheme which Mr Staunton oversaw has actually been completed, and my understanding is 100% of payments have been made, so clearly no instruction was given.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.49pm GMT\n\n\n 4.30pm GMT \n\nJonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, says there are now two completely conflicting accounts of how Henry Staunton was sacked.

The main claim has been covered extensively here already, but Staunton made a series of specific claims. Here is the full list.\n\nStaunton claimed that a senior official from the business departments asked him to stall compensation payments to victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal until after the general election. He told the Sunday Times:\n\n\nEarly on, I was told by a fairly senior person to stall on spending on compensation and on the replacement of Horizon, and to limp, in quotation marks – I did a file note on it – limp into the election.\nIt was not an anti-postmaster thing, it was just straight financials. I didn’t ask, because I said, ‘I’m having no part of it – I’m not here to limp into the election, it’s not the right thing to do by postmasters.’ The word ‘limp’ gives you a snapshot of where they were.\n\n\nHe claimed that, when she called to sack him, Badenoch told him: “Well, someone’s got to take the rap for this [the Horizon scandal].”\n\n\nHe claimed that the UK government’s representative on the Post Office’s board was behind a move to suggest some post office operators caught up in the scandal should not be exonerated because they were probably guilty. This is how the Sunday Times wrote this up.\n\n\nStaunton said UK Government Investments (UKGI), the body staffed by former investment bankers that manages taxpayers’ stakes in assets such as the Post Office, appeared to oppose blanket exoneration. Last month — after [the ITV’s drama about the scandal was aired] – Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office, wrote to the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, with a legal opinion from the Post Office’s solicitors at Peters & Peters attached. The message said that in more than 300 cases, non-Horizon evidence supported sub-postmasters’ convictions. “Basically, it was trying to undermine the exoneration argument,” Staunton said. “It was, ‘Most people haven’t come forward because they are guilty as charged’ – ie think very carefully about exoneration. I said to Nick [Read], ‘This is not right – this goes to the heart of how we as an organisation feel. You’ve sent that letter as if that’s our view, and that is not my view, and it is not the view of at least half of the board … If this got out, we’d be crucified, and rightly so’.”\nAccording to Staunton, Read said he sent the letter at UKGI’s behest …\n“It was terrible, terrible governance,” [Staunton said.] “I picked it up with the UKGI director, who didn’t deny it but didn’t really want to talk about it. And I thought it was not my job to work out what the politics is behind all this.”\n\n\nHe said that he expected Read to leave his post as chief executive soon because he is finding interference by UKGI “desperately frustrating”. \n\n\nStaunton said that ‘a big part” of the reason why he was sacked was because he opposed a bid by the government to put a Whitehall insider on the board. Staunton wanted the vacancy to be filled by Andrew Darfoor, who was the choice of the Post Office board.\n\n\nHe said that Read often described the Post Office investigators, who prosecuted the post office operatives, as “the untouchables” because the organisation felt it could not get rid of them.\n\n\nStaunton said there was a “toxic” culture at the Post Office where many senior figures thought many of the post officer operators claiming to be victims of a miscarriage of justice were in fact guilty.\n\n\n\n\n 3.46pm GMT \nLabour claims Jeremy Hunt's failure to answer urgent question about state of economy an 'insult' to voters\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, told MPs that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, should be responding to the urgent question, not Bim Afolami. His failure to turn up was “an insult to all those people who go to work every day and experience the reality of 14 years of conservative economic failure”, she said.\nShe went on:\n\nWill the minister explain why the economy is now smaller than when the current prime minister entered 10 Downing Street? Does the minister accept the misery that this government has caused homeowners with their kamikaze budget, leaving a typical family renewing their mortgage paying an additional £240 pounds every single month?\n\nShe also pointed out that the UK Statistics Authority has reprimanded Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, for making misleading claims about tax cuts.\n\nUpdated at 6.11pm GMT\n\n\n 3.37pm GMT \n\nBim Afolami, a junior Treasury minister, is responding to the Labour urgent question about the economy.\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, tabled the question in response to the news last week that the UK has entered a recession.\nBut Afolami isn’t letting that deter him. He says just over a year ago the Bank of England was forecasting the longest recession in 100 years. But now the IMF is saying the UK will grow faster than countries like Japan, Germany and France over the next few years, he says.\nHe says the biggest threat to the economy is Labour because their energy policy would require investment costing £28bn a year.\n\n\n\n 3.32pm GMT \nGovernment closes scheme allowing family members to join Ukrainians offered refuge in UK\n\nA scheme under which Ukrainians could join family members taking sanctuary in the UK has been unexpectedly closed in what opposition politicians described as a “cruel” and “below the radar” move days before the two year anniversary of Russia’s invasion.\nThe Ukraine family scheme is being shut against the backdrop of a relatively high number of rejections while a separate Homes for Ukraine Scheme would continue to serve needs, according to government officials.\nHowever, the SNP said the government was forcing Ukrainian refugees to “jump through hoops” to remain safely in the UK.\nAlison Thewliss, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, said:\n\nBeyond the lack of notice of the scheme ending, the UK government has also reduced the length of sanctuary from 36 months to 18 months within the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and grounds for refusing visas, which were rightly waived after the invasion of Ukraine, will now start being applied.\n\nStephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said ministers needed to urgently explain the justification for the changes and how they will ensure vulnerable Ukrainians are not put at risk by these changes. He said:\n\nThe numbers arriving on visa schemes have already dropped but many that are coming are often in very desperate personal situations. Restricting family rights at a time when Ukrainian troops are under heavy fire in Donetsk sends the wrong message to the people of Ukraine about our willingness to stand with them.\n\n\n\n\n 3.22pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer has welcomed new Labour MPs Gen Kitchen and Damien Egan to parliament after their byelection victories in Wellingborough and Kingswood last week. At a photocall in Westminster Hall, he told Labour MPs:\n\nThey both overturned incredible majorities, the like of which we wouldn’t normally be able to overturn, making history before they’d even been sworn in as members of parliament, a fantastic achievement. And if we carry on like this with byelections, we’re going to need a bigger hall …\nBut, and there’s always a but from me, particularly as a football fan, one good result in February doesn’t win you the league. We need to stay focused, stay disciplined, celebrate these fantastic new members of parliament and go on and win that general election.\n\n\n\n\n 3.09pm GMT \nPostal services minister says he does not 'recognise' Staunton's claim about compensation payments being delayed\n\nKevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, told Sky News that he did not “recognise” what Henry Staunton was saying about the government privately wanting the Post Office to “stall” the payment of compensation to victims of the Horizon scandal. He said:\n\nWe’ve been very focused on getting that compensation out the door as quickly as possible.\nWe’ve done much to try and accelerate those payments over the time Henry Staunton was in office so I don’t recognise what he’s saying and I’m bit confused why he’s saying it.\n\nKemi Badenoch, Hollinrake’s boss, has accused Staunton of telling outright lies. Hollinrake’s tone is quite different. Saying that you do not “recognise” something as true is quite a long way off saying that it’s incorrect and, in Whitehall terminology, this is normally understood as a form of “non-denial denial” – something that sounds like a denial without actually being one.\n\nUpdated at 3.10pm GMT\n\n\n 2.57pm GMT \nEx-Post Office chair Henry Staunton defends claim about government wanting to delay compensation payments\n\nHenry Staunton, the former Post Office chair, has said that it was “pretty obvious” that until very recently the government was dragging its feet on paying compensation to the victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal.\nHe made the comment in a statement issued to Sky News in which he defended his statement about being told, when he was at the Post Office, that the government wanted to “stall” the payment of compensation until the general election. (See 9.21am.)\nStaunton says he was told this by a senior official from the business department whom he has not named. The government has said that it is wrong to say that delaying compensation payments was ever government policy.\nIn his statement, Staunton said:\n\nIt was in the interests of the business, as well as being fair for the postmasters, that there was faster progress on exoneration and that compensation was more generous, but we didn’t see any real movement until after the Mr Bates programme.\nI think it is pretty obvious to everyone what was really going on.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.10pm GMT\n\n\n 2.44pm GMT \nCutting corporation tax in Northern Ireland would harm public services, economy minister tells Stormont\n\nThere are no current plans to cut corporation tax in Northern Ireland, the Stormont economy minister has said. As PA Media reports, Conor Murphy was speaking as he outlined his economic vision for the region in the remaining three years of the assembly term.\nThere had previously been calls to cut the corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland in the hope of becoming more competitive as a place to invest. As part of the government’s recent Safeguarding the Union command paper, there is a commitment to work urgently to devolve corporation tax powers to Stormont.\nBut Murphy told MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) today that it is “not something we’re rushing into”. He said:\n\nThe difficulty for us is that the Treasury’s approach to the devolution of taxation and particularly corporation tax is that they want the money upfront that they think it would yield – that comes directly from our public services.\nOur public services are so underfunded, and we are so underfunded in terms of our level of need, that I don’t think it’d be conscionable to try and denude them any more of finance in order to hope for the benefit back that a lower corporation tax might mean … and you don’t have any guarantees in relation to what it would bring back.\nSo I do think we have economic levers in terms of our approach to the policies we can set and we have to use them as best we can in the time ahead to try and grow the economy. I don’t see corporation tax playing any part in that any time soon.\n\n\n\n\n 2.12pm GMT \nLabour confirms it would ban drag hunting\n\nLabour has confirmed that it would ban drag hunting, a form of hunting where dogs follow an artificial scent laid down intentionally. It is meant to a humane form of hunting, and it was allowed to continue when the last Labour government banned conventional hunting, but campaigners say that drag hunts often result (intentionally or otherwise) in real foxes being chased and killed by the hounds.\nIn an interview with the Times, Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said:\n\nPeople have seen the images of packs of hounds getting into private back gardens, killing cats, ripping flocks apart. There’s not a majority in any part of the country that wants to see that continue.\nThe hunting ban was passed under the last Labour government and it has been maintained under this Conservative government. So that seems fairly settled to me. But there are loopholes in it, drag hunting for instance, that allow hunting to continue, and foxes – and indeed domestic cats and other mammals – are still getting killed as a result of those loopholes and we will close those loopholes.\n\nReed said the ban would be introduced during the first term of a Labour government.\n\n\n\n 1.26pm GMT \nExperts welcome news Labour wants to use citizens' assemblies to push through policy in difficult areas\n\nLabour intends to use citizens’ assemblies to push through proposals in controversial policy areas, Sue Gray has revealed.\nGray, the former senior civil servant who is now Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, made the comment in an interview with Tom Baldwin for his new biography of the Labour leader.\nCitizens assemblies involve getting a random selection of people, like those chosen for a jury, to listen to evidence from experts about a tricky policy area and to agree on a consensus solution.\nThey are seen as an effective means of coming up with proposals broadly acceptable to the public as a whole when the political process is deadlocked, or resistant to reform. In Ireland citizens’ assemblies endorsed plans to legalise same-sex marriage and to lift the country’s ban on abortion, both of which subsequently became law after being endorsed in referendums.\nIn her interview, Gray said Labour might use citizens’ assemblies to produce plans for Lords reform, for devolution of powers to elected mayor and for planning reforms to allow more house building. As the Times reports, she said:\n\nThis is one way we can help resolve these questions by involving communities at an early stage … Whitehall will not like this because they have no control.\n\nPolly Curtis, chief executive of the thinktank Demos, welcomed the news saying:\n\nCitizens’ assemblies have been proven around the world to help governments settle difficult policy questions and overcome some of the polarisation in politics today. Creating fair and trusted ways for citizens to participate in policy-making can improve policy outcomes, strengthen citizenry and start to address the crisis in trust in politics.\n\nDemos is currently working with the charity Involve, which runs citizens’ assemblies for councils, on a white paper setting out how Westminster could use them. Curtis said:\n\nIt’s not about undermining our current democracy or removing accountability from parliament but emboldening politicians to know how to navigate the difficult trade offs that so many policies are going to require. We need to partner with the public and create a more collaborative democracy than we have now.\n\nAnd Willie Sullivan, director of campaigns for the Electoral Reform Society, also welcomed the news that Labour is keen on citizens’ assemblies. He said:\n\nTrust is a two-way street, if politicians are to restore our trust in politics, they have to also trust the people. Citizens’ assemblies have been shown to help other countries, such as Ireland, navigate divisive issues and political impasses, and should play a vital role in the UK. The best way to rejuvenate our democracy, restore trust and make politics work better for the country is to have the public more directly involved in the big policy decisions that impact them.\n\nUPDATE: As the BBC’s Henry Zeffman reports, Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has said Labour could also use a citizens’ assembly to come up with a proposal to allow assisted dying.\n\n\nNEW: More details on Labour's plans for citizens' assemblies, revealed by Sue Gray in an interview with @TomBaldwin66 Wes Streeting tells me assemblies could be used to settle \"thorny issues\" such as assisted dying https://t.co/yJZwcgvo2v— Henry Zeffman (@hzeffman) February 19, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.32pm GMT\n\n\n 1.12pm GMT \nBadenoch to defend her claims about ex-Post Office chair in statement to MPs\n\nThere will be one urgent question in the Commons today, followed by three statements.

(Earlier there were suggestions that Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, would do this instead. But Badenoch apparently was keen to defend her actions herself.)\nAround 5.15pm: Leo Docherty, the Foreign Office minister, makes a statement on the death of Alexei Navalny.\nAround 6.15pm: Chris Philp, the policing minister, makes a statement on antisemitism.\n\n\n\n 12.45pm GMT \n\nForeign Office minister Leo Docherty will make a statement in the Commons following the death of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, No 10 has said. As PA Media reports, Rishi Sunak is also expected to hold a cabinet meeting this afternoon, bringing it forward from its usual Tuesday morning slot.\nAt the morning lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson told reporters:\n\nIt is very clear that the Russian authorities saw him as a threat and that is why they imprisoned him on fabricated charges.\nThe fact that the FSB [the Russian federal security service] poisoned him with a banned nerve agent and then sent him to an Arctic penal colony … His death must be investigated fully, and all of those in the Russian regime must be held to account.\n\nThe spokesperson would not comment on possible future sanctions but said the UK had agreed the “most comprehensive package of sanctions ever brought to bear on a major economy” in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 12.35pm GMT \nNo 10 defends Badenoch in row with ex-Post Office chief but declines to back her claim he lied about their conversation\n\nNo 10 has declined to repeat Kemi Badenoch’s claim that the former chair of the Post Office gave an interview “full of lies” about the conversation she had when she sacked him.\nAt the morning lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson would not adopt the language used by Badenoch in a post on X yesterday and instead claimed that Badenoch believes that the account of what she said given by Henry Staunton is a “misrepresentation”.\nIt also emerged that Badenoch herself is not expected to be in the Commons herself this afternoon defending her conduct in this matter. Instead Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, is expected to address MPs.\nYesterday Badenoch said that Staunton’s interview with the Sunday Times about the conversation they had when she sacked him recently was “full of lies”. Asked if No 10 agreed that Staunton was a liar, the spokesperson said:\n\nObviously this referred to a conversation that she had with Henry Staunton, and you’ll have seen her words on this; she’s very clear that the interview that he gave was a misrepresentation of her conversation with him and the reasons for his dismissal.\nAnd the government has being clear, and will refute the allegations [that it wanted to slow down compensation to victims]. The government has taken action to speed up the compensation to victims, and we’ve consistently encouraged postmasters to come forward with their claims. Any suggestions otherwise [are] not correct.\n\nThe spokesperson also refused to say whether No 10 has seen the record kept by officials of the call between Badenoch and Staunton, or whether those notes will be published.\nThe spokesperson said the letter sent to Staunton by the business department showed that the government did not want the Post Office to slow down the payment of compensation to post office operators. When it was put to him that the letter also showed Staunton was expected to control costs (see 9.21am), the spokesperson did not accept that this meant the government was not committed to paying compensation promptly.\nAsked if he could categorically say that no one from government asked Staunton to stall compensation payments, the spokesperson said the government had sped up compensation to victims and any suggestions otherwise were not correct.\n\nUpdated at 12.41pm GMT\n\n\n 11.54am GMT \n\nThe Guardian has produced an opinion poll tracker that we will be updating daily between now and the general election.

It says:\n\nWe have received around 500 complaints about the programme which aired on GB News on 12 February 2024.\nWe are investigating under Rules 5.11 and 5.12 of the Broadcasting Code which provide additional due impartiality requirements for programmes dealing with matters of major political controversy and major matters relating to current public policy. Specifically, Rules 5.11 and 5.12 require that an appropriately wide range of significant views must be included and given due weight in such programmes, or in clearly linked and timely programmes.\n\nThe show has been criticised because Sunak was not subject to the sort of comeback and challenge during the Q&A that he would get from a similar event staged by an established broadcaster like the BBC or Sky News. In his sketch, John Crace wrote: “Nearly every Conservative MP has their own show on GB News, so it was only a matter of time before it was Rishi Sunak’s turn.”\nGB News has been found to have broken Ofcom rules at least five times, and other complaints are outstanding, but that has not stopped commentators arguing that the regulator should be doing a lot more to ensure it maintains conventional impartiality standards.

(See 9.21am.) She has also used an article in the Daily Mail to condemn the actor Michael Sheen over a comment he made about the steel plant in Port Talbot. She said:\n\nPromoting his new drama The Way, Michael Sheen has said that ‘the people of Port Talbot have been let down’ regarding redundancies at its steel plant.\nBut he is wrong. Port Talbot is iconic to British industry and that’s why the government is investing so much to ensure we keep its steelworks for the next century at a time when the market says we should abandon it.\n\nThe first episode of The Way goes out on BBC One tonight and it’s a drama about a workers’ uprising in response to the closure of a steel plant in south Wales. The BBC insists its fictional, and not about the Tata factory in Port Talbot. Sheen is a supporter of leftwing causes, but the quote Badenoch refers to is from a Times interview about the drama in which Sheen was not even directly criticising the government.\nThe Mail has run the article alongside a news story quoting the Tory MP Lee Anderson, and another unnamed Conservative, claiming the drama is evidence of the BBC being biased against the government.\nXan Brooks wrote a piece about the thriller, written by James Graham, for the Guardian earlier this month.\n\n Related: ‘Destroying your home town is quite satisfying’: inside Michael Sheen’s explosive Welsh revolution thriller \n\n\nUpdated at 11.56am GMT\n\n\n 10.29am GMT \nGove announces plan to give councils new power to restrict spread of Airbnb-type short-term lets\n\nMichael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has announced plans intended to give councils in England new powers to restrict the spread of Airbnb-type short-term lets.\nIn a news release explaining the moves, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says:\n\nUnder the reforms councils will be given greater power to control short-term lets by making them subject to the planning process. This will support local people in areas where high numbers of short-term lets are preventing them from finding housing they can afford to buy or to rent.\nThese changes are part of a long-term plan to prevent a “hollowing out” of communities, address anti-social behaviour and ensure local people can continue to live in the place they call home.\nMeanwhile, a new mandatory national register will give local authorities the information they need about short-term lets in their area. This will help councils understand the extent of short-term lets in their area, the effects on their communities, and underpin compliance with key health and safety regulations …\nThe proposed planning changes would see a new planning ‘use class’ created for short-term lets not used as a sole or main home. Existing dedicated short-term lets will automatically be reclassified into the new use class and will not require a planning application.\n\n\n\n\n 10.19am GMT \nStreeting says he would probably spoil his ballot paper if he had to vote in Rochdale byelection\n\nIn another interview this morning Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, described the situation for Labour voters in the Rochdale byelection as “appalling”. The constituency will elect a new MP next week, but now that Labour has withdrawn support from its candidate, Azhar Ali, voters can’t choose someone who will be able to take the whip as a Labour MP. Streeting said:\n\nI’m not going to pretend that this has been Labour’s finest hour. We’ve got people going to the polls in Rochdale who don’t have a good Labour candidate to vote for. I’m really sorry that’s the case – I think it’s an appalling position to be in.\nBut what I wouldn’t want is for Labour to stand by someone who’s peddled antisemitic conspiracy theories, and that’s why Keir’s taken this unprecedented action.\n\nUPDATE: Streeting also said, if he lived in Rochdale, he would probably refuse to vote for any candidate and spoil his ballot paper.\n\n\n“I'd probably go along and spoil my ballot”With Labour withdrawing support for their candidate in Rochdale, we ask @wesstreeting what voters should do at the upcoming by-election. #KayBurley EB pic.twitter.com/KbUVFLJeLk— Kay Burley (@KayBurley) February 19, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.40pm GMT\n\n\n 10.11am GMT \n‘Scandalous’ if UK watchdog role left empty when Rwanda plan starts, says inspector\n\nDavid Neal, the UK’s chief inspector of borders and immigration, has said it is “scandalous” that his watchdog role could be left vacant while the Rwanda scheme is introduced, Kevin Rawlinson reports.\n\n Related: ‘Scandalous’ if UK watchdog role left empty when Rwanda plan starts, says inspector \n\n\n\n\n 9.49am GMT \nLabour won't be 'pushed around by SNP' on Gaza, says Streeting\n\nIn an interview with the Today programme, Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, also said that Labour would not be “pushed around the by the SNP” in setting out its policy on Gaza.\nAsked if Labour would be voting for the SNP motion on Wednesday, Streeting at first said the party would wait until the final wording was out.

A ceasefire that lasts. That is what must happen now. The fighting must stop now.\n\n\n Related: Starmer says Gaza fighting ‘must stop now’ and warns against Rafah assault \n\nHere is the text of the SNP motion for debate on Wednesday.\n\nThat this house calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel; notes with shock and distress that the death toll has now risen beyond 28,000, the vast majority of whom were women and children; further notes that there are currently 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah, 610,000 of whom are children; also notes that they have nowhere else to go; condemns any military assault on what is now the largest refugee camp in the world; further calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken by Hamas and an end to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people; and recognises that the only way to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians is to press for a ceasefire now.\n\n\n\n\n 9.36am GMT \nStreeting says Israel has 'gone too far' in Gaza and its actions go 'beyond reasonable self-defence'\n\nWes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has said that Israel has “gone too far” in Gaza and that its military offensive goes “beyond reasonable self-defence”.\nIn an interview with Sky News this morning, ahead of a Commons debate on Wednesday where Labour must decide whether or not to vote for an SNP motion calling for “an immediate ceasefire” in Gaza, Streeting said:\n\nWe want to see a ceasefire, of course we do. And we have been increasingly concerned, as the wider international community has been, with the disproportionate loss of civilian life in Gaza.\nIsrael has a responsibility to get its hostages back, every country in the world has a right to defend itself.\nBut I think what we have seen are actions that go beyond reasonable self-defence and also call into question whether Israel has broken international law.\nThe ICJ [International Court of Justice] are now investigating and we take all of that seriously.\n\nAsked whether he thought Israel had “gone too fast”, Streeting replied: \n\nI think, objectively, yes, Israel has gone too far. And we have seen that with a disproportionate loss of innocent civilian life.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.51am GMT\n\n\n 9.21am GMT \nMinister suggests Kemi Badenoch should publish evidence to confirm her claim about ex-Post Office chair lying about call\n\nGood morning. Yesterday Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, accused the former Post Office chair, Henry Staunton, of giving an interview “full of lies” about the conversation they had when she sacked him recently. Josh Halliday has the story here, and here is one of the tweets from a thread that Badenoch posted on Twitter.\n\nMy call with Staunton was with officials. They took a complete record. He has given an interview full of lies about our conversation during his dismissal. The details will emerge soon enough as I won’t let the matter rest here, but will be discussing with govt lawyers. (3/5)\n\n\n\nMy call with Staunton was with officials. They took a complete record.He has given an interview full of lies about our conversation during his dismissal. The details will emerge soon enough as I won’t let the matter rest here, but will be discussing with govt lawyers. (3/5)— Kemi Badenoch (@KemiBadenoch) February 18, 2024\n\n\nBadenoch said she would be making a further statement today.\nThe row is partly, but not entirely, about what was said in that Badenoch/Staunton conversation where he was sacked. Staunton told the Sunday Times that he had not even met Badenoch, that he learned he was going to lose his job from a Sky News journalist shortly before she called, and that in the conversation she referred to the Post Office Horizon scandal, telling him: “Well, someone’s got to take the rap for this.” Badenoch said yesterday that officials were listening in on the call and that they took a complete record.\nThe education secretary, Gillian Keegan, was doing the morning interview round for the government and she suggested that Badenoch should release the record of the conversation to prove her claims about Staunton telling lies. Asked on the Today programme if Badenoch would releasing those notes, she replied:\n\nI’m sure they will make a statement or release something. My understanding is that the government made clear in the appointment letter that focusing on and prioritising the compensation for sub-postmasters was a key aspect of the job.\n\nThe presenter, Mishal Husain, asked again if notes of the call would be released. Keegan said she had not spoken to Badenoch directly about this, but she said that she was sure officials did keep a record of what was said. Asked again if Badenoch would provide evidence to back up her claims, Keegan said:\n\nI haven’t spoken to her, but I’m sure she will back it up.\n\nThe most serious claim made by Staunton in his Sunday Times interview was not about what Badenoch said when she sacked him, but what he said about another conversation, with an unnamed senior official in the business department. Staunton said he was told “to stall on spend on compensation [for victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal] and on the replacement of Horizon, and to limp, in quotation marks – I did a file note on it – limp into the election”.\nIn her Today interview, Keegan said this claim was “at odds” with what Staunton was told in his appointment letter, released by the department last night.\n\n\n🚨 Fact Check 🚨 The Government made clear to the Chair of the Post Office that reaching payment settlements with victims of the Horizon scandal was a priority when he took the role. Claims to the contrary are simply not true. Read the full letter below 👇 pic.twitter.com/QzPjDUURf2— Department for Business and Trade (@biztradegovuk) February 18, 2024\n\n\nKeegan said the letter “basically says you’re to prioritise the sub-postmasters and their fair compensation”.\nBut in fact the letter, sent by Sarah Munby, who at the time was permanent secretary at the department, does not quite say that. It says “resolving historical litigation issues” should be a priority. But it also implies an even more important priority is effective financial management, including “effective management of legal costs”.\nThe letter does not disprove Staunton’s claim about being told to “stall” on compensation payments. Staunton told the Sunday Times this was just a money issue, and arguably his claim is consistent with what the letter says about the need to control costs.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10am: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, gives a speech on Scotland’s green future.\n10.30am: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, holds a press conference on how the Welsh government is looking to strengthen international relationships.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n2.30pm: Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\nAfter 3.30pm: A Foreign Office minister is expected to give a statement on the death of Alexei Navalny, and Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, is expected to give a statement on claims made by the former Post Office chair.\nAfternoon: Peers resume the committee stage debate for the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill.\n4pm: Tim Davie, the BBC director general, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee.\nAfternoon: David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is expected to arrive in the Falkland Islands.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "It must be exhausting to be Kemi Badenoch. That never-ending surge of rage. Not the slightest effort to keep it repressed. Who knows what someone must have done to Kemi when she was young to leave her that badly damaged? She is a woman in urgent need of a therapist. Before she creates even more havoc.\nThere is no feud, no imagined slight, no minor disagreement even, that she won’t pursue to the ends of the earth. She can never dream of saying sorry. She lives in a binary world of death or glory. There are no half measures.\nKemi has yet to discover an occasion where she once might have been wrong. Where the facts are open to interpretation. She lives for the thrill of the fight. She is that Tory oxymoron. A passionate defender of free speech. Except where there is some criticism being made of her. Then it is something that must be stamped out. Vengeance shall be hers.\nIn some parts of the Conservative party – primarily the intellectually deprived – Badenoch is what amounts to the Last Hope. The last woman standing after the annihilation of the next election, who will rise from the ashes to lead them back into their own funeral pyre. The leader hell-bent on self-destruction. There are still a handful of MPs who are aroused by the thought of a suicide mission. One driven by fury.\nIf Badenoch does have friends in low places– she is, after all, a member of the Evil Plotters WhatsApp group despite insisting she remains loyal to Rishi Sunak at every turn – there weren’t that many of them in the Commons to hear her ministerial response to the Sunday Times interview in which Henry Staunton, the sacked Post Office chair, had claimed he had been under orders to delay compensation payments. Just a sad triumvirate of Conor Burns, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith.\nNot that Kemi was bothered by the lack of support. She had her outrage – her ever-faithful companion – as her comfort blanket. No woman could need more. She could barely contain herself from the moment she set foot in the chamber. Itching for the speaker to give her the nod. To let slip the dogs of the latest culture war.\nShe briefly had to remind herself of what she was so furious about this time. An understandable hesitation as it’s so hard to keep up. Only that morning she had written a hate screed in the Daily Mail about the actor Michael Sheen daring to suggest that steelworkers were having a rough time. How dare a Welshman speak about Wales!\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThen the business secretary connected with her latest rage fest. Staunton. Yes, she was sorry that Sky and the Daily Mail should have found out about her decision to sack Staunton before she had told him herself. Kemi was mystified how this had happened. After all, she didn’t know anyone at the Daily Mail apart from the editor, for whom she regularly writes. It must be so irritating to be thought to be one of the leakiest members of the cabinet – a minister always happy to give an unattributed quote – when to do such a thing would never cross your mind.\nAs for Staunton’s claims that the government had needed someone at the Post Office to take the rap for the Horizon scandal and had also ordered him to delay the compensation payments till after the election, that was all a lie. Badenoch looked across the chamber, daring anyone to disagree with her. Begging them to disagree with her. She had a semi-automatic assault rifle by her side and she wasn’t afraid to use it.\nLabour’s shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, chose not to engage. He wasn’t entirely convinced that Kemi was telling the truth – she isn’t noted for her veracity – but he couldn’t bring himself to get caught in the crossfire. So he muttered a few platitudes about taking Badenoch’s word for it and looking forward to her supplying documentary evidence. Kemi looked almost disappointed that he had caved in so easily.\nOthers weren’t so easily bought off, though. Some Labour – and a few Tory – MPs pointed out that many Post Office operatives were having problems with slow and derisory compensation claims. Hell, even the Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake, sitting loyally if nervously by Kemi’s side, had reported that the government had been slow to deal with the scandal before the ITV drama. Something the business secretary had just brazenly denied.\n“What’s your fucking problem, you fucking fucks?” was the subtext of almost every subsequent exchange that Kemi had. She even managed to pick a fight with Kevan Jones, one of the few MPs to have emerged with credit from the Horizon scandal. A man who had done more to try to win cross-party support for the post office operatives than almost anyone else in Westminster.\nBut in Kemi world, you’re either with her or against her. And daring to suggest that he would like to see some hard evidence before offering her his support crossed a line. It was all very well slagging off Staunton in the Commons where she was protected by parliamentary privilege. Let’s see her do it elsewhere. Preferably not on Twitter, where Kemi has also been known to have extended rants\nBadenoch shook her head. This was just political point scoring. Something she would never do. And how dare Labour also suggest the government was delaying compensation for the infected blood scandal till after the election. Even though we all know it to be true. But that’s the Kemi enigma. Even the truth is a personal attack on her integrity. Especially the truth. The truth cannot be tolerated. So Lee Anderson came to her rescue. Accusing Labour of doing something it hadn’t done. Poor Lee. He really isn’t the sharpest pencil.\nStill, Kemi was having a better time of it than the unfortunate Bim Afolami. The no-mark junior treasury minister who was forced to answer an urgent question on the government’s magnificent achievement on tipping the economy into recession. Jeremy Hunt was nowhere to be seen – he’s a genuine liability these days – and the quarter-witted Laura Trott was in remedial debt classes.\nSo Nice But Dim Bim was forced to take the hit. It was an embarrassment. Everything was going to plan. Just no one had understood the plan was to bankrupt the country. And yes, things could be better. Indeed they could. We could have Rachel Reeves as chancellor. A serious grown-up. As it was, Dim Bim was laughed at for the best part of 45 minutes. There is no greater humiliation."

        "content": "A Foreign Office minister has ruled out a prisoner swap for the imprisoned Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza, a British citizen, who MPs have expressed concern about after the death of Alexei Navalny. Kara-Murza’s wife was now adamant that she wanted everything to be done to get her her husband out of Russia, said the Conservative backbencher Bob Seely, who urged the government to countenance swapping imprisoned spies for the pro-democracy activist who was now the most high-profile Russian political prisoner. Seely, who is in contact with the Kara-Murza and Navalny families, said when he had discussed prisoners swaps with the Foreign Office it had been made clear to him that such moves only encouraged state hostage taking. “His health is in a fragile condition and if Putin can kill Navalny he can kill Kara-Murza,” said the MP, who chairs the all party parliamentary group on Russia. He urged a Foreign Office minister to reassure parliament that “every conceivable course of action, potentially including negotiated swaps using Russian spies” will be looked at “because otherwise [Kara-Murza] will be next”. Leo Docherty, who was making a statement on the death of Navalny in the absence of the foreign secretary, David Cameron, said: “We could not and would not countenance a policy of prisoners swap but of course we continue to make every effort to support Mrs Kara-Murza and to seek the release of Vladimir.” Kara-Murza, who is serving a 25-year sentence for treason, has twice survived poisonings that he blamed on the Russian authorities, and rejected the charges against him as punishment for standing up to Putin. Docherty, the minister for Europe and North America, said earlier it was right to describe Navalny’s death as murder and told MPs that Britain continued to look at new legal paths to ensure that frozen Russian assets could be used help those affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Stephen Doughty, shadow minister for Europe, said that Navalny had not just challenged Russian kleptocracy and autocracy but also past western enablement of this and his campaign had been not just about Moscow but the role played by London as a haven for Russian oligarchs. “We must deliver the changes we campaigned for. The reality is that we still have much further to go,” he said, calling for the government to review further sanctions against Russia, including an assessment of the nearly 8,000 people on Navalny’s “list” of Vladimir Putin’s henchmen. “It was a source of shame that under successive Tory governments Britain became the money-laundering capital of the world and our tributes to Alexei Navalny must be more than just rhetorical.” Another Labour MP, Margaret Hodge, said a loophole in Britain’s sanctions regime means countries like China and India continued to import Russian crude oil, process it and then sell into the UK as a refined oil. About 5.2m barrels were imported last year, said Hodge, who added this resulted in £141m in tax revenue being channelled into the “Kremlin’s war chest”. Conservative backbenchers, meanwhile, pressed Docherty to dismiss Russia’s ambassador and sever diplomatic ties with Moscow. “What advantages remain in maintaining diplomatic relations with this murderous and barbarous regime?” asked Jacob Rees-Mogg. Docherty said that the benefits including being able to deliver “message of outrage and condemnation” and also to advocate for consular access to those held by Putin’s regime."

        "content": "Keir Starmer risks triggering the biggest rebellion of his leadership if he tries to stop his MPs voting on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, backbenchers have warned. Labour MPs are urging their leader not to whip them against voting for a Scottish National party motion this week calling for a ceasefire, three months after a similar vote saw 56 members rebel, including eight frontbenchers. Party whips have not yet decided how to approach Wednesday’s vote, but several MPs have told the Guardian they risk another damaging internal row if they try to oppose it. The Scottish Labour party voted this weekend in favour an immediate ceasefire, but Starmer has so far stopped short of backing such a position, saying instead that Israel and Hamas need to “get to” an end to the fighting. One Labour MP said: “I suspect it will be far more than the 56 who [rebelled] last time, especially given the Scottish Labour position and how many more MPs are really under pressure on this now.” Another said: “I hope we end up in a better position than last time – we need to not get into the same position as last time.”   Related: Starmer facing test of authority as ‘immediate’ Gaza ceasefire vote looms   The Middle East crisis has proven one of the toughest tests of Starmer’s leadership. The Labour leader was criticised in the weeks after the 7 October attack for his strenuous defence of Israel’s military action. Then in November, he suffered the biggest rebellion since becoming leader when dozens of MPs defied orders to vote for an SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. Last week, Starmer suspended two Labour candidates for making derogatory remarks about Israel during a meeting designed to persuade those upset by his stance on the war not to leave the party. He was accused of acting too slowly to discipline Azhar Ali, however, after the party’s candidate in Rochdale was recorded saying he believed Israel had allowed the 7 October attack to happen as a pretext for war. The SNP is now seeking to reopen Labour’s wounds with a motion on Wednesday mirroring the one in November. Since then, however, the Labour leadership has changed its position on the war, including calling for a ceasefire, even if not backing a permanent one straight away. Starmer told the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow this weekend that the “fighting must stop now” in Gaza, warning Israel not to invade the southern city of Rafah, where 1.5 million people are taking refuge.   Related: Israel says it will launch Rafah assault if hostages not freed by Ramadan   Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, spurred hope among some Labour MPs that the party’s position was changing further when he said on Monday morning that Israel had gone “beyond reasonable self-defence” in Gaza. He told Sky News: “We want to see a ceasefire, of course we do. And we have been increasingly concerned, as the wider international community has been, with the disproportionate loss of civilian life in Gaza. “Israel has a responsibility to get its hostages back, every country in the world has a right to defend itself. But I think what we have seen are actions that go beyond reasonable self-defence and also call into question whether Israel has broken international law. The ICJ [international court of justice] are now investigating and we take all of that seriously.” Asked if he thought Israel had gone beyond what was proportionate, Streeting replied: “I think, objectively, yes, Israel has gone too far. And we have seen that with a disproportionate loss of innocent civilian life.” In another interview on TalkTV, however, Streeting said the party’s leadership had not yet decided how to approach Wednesday’s vote. “We’ll see what the final motion looks like,” he said.“We’re considering our own options on this – we all want to see a ceasefire. We’ve seen an intolerable loss of innocent civilian life during the course of this war. “But we’re not going to be pushed around by protesters, and we’re not going to be told what to say by our opponents in parliament either.”  Guardian Newsroom: The unfolding crisis in the Middle East  On Wednesday 20 March, 7-8.15pm GMT, join Devika Bhat, Peter Beaumont and Ghaith Abdul-Ahad as they discuss the fast developing crisis in the Middle East.

        "content": "Humza Yousaf has accused Labour of behaving like Margaret Thatcher by throwing oil and gas workers “on the scrapheap”, as he announced the Scottish National party would not back proposals for extending the fossil fuel windfall tax. In a campaign speech delivered in Aberdeen, the UK’s oil capital, Scotland’s first minister accused Labour of risking 100,000 jobs after Keir Starmer promised a “proper” windfall tax on oil and gas firms this month when he scaled back his party’s £28bn green investment pledge. Yousaf, who later told journalists he favoured maintaining the energy profits levy at the current 75% level, said in his speech: “Don’t get me wrong, we support a windfall tax but Labour’s plans to increase this to pay for nuclear energy power plants in England is plain wrong and will cost tens of thousands of jobs. “There is no justice in a transition that throws north-east workers on the scrapheap. The SNP will not let the north-east go the way that coal and mining towns went under Thatcher – that is exactly what Labour is threatening to do.” If elected, Labour intends to raise the levy from 75% to 78% and extend it to 2029 to help pay for its green spending plans. But Yousaf said the plans “to raid the north-east energy industry” meant that anger in the sector had “reached new levels”. Meanwhile, a body representing the offshore oil and gas industry, Offshore Energy UK, announced it would hold “emergency summits” this week in Aberdeen and London to discuss the proposals, which it described as “deeply concerning”. Yousaf’s attempts to appeal to the oil industry, which has been increasingly sceptical of the Scottish government’s plans for transition to net zero, its opposition to further exploration and its partnership with the Scottish Greens, were dismissed by opposition leaders as “breathtaking hypocrisy”. Later on Monday, the Scottish Greens’ climate and energy spokesperson, Mark Ruskell, described the SNP leader’s comments as “a little alarmist”. Interviewed on BBC Radio Scotland, Ruskell said he did agree that “where a windfall tax is levied we need to spend it on a transition in Scotland for oil and gas workers” rather than “propping up the development of new nuclear power stations in England”. Yousaf’s intervention came a day after Starmer’s speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, where the Labour leader promised work in the sector would continue “for decades to come” in an attempt to defuse the growing backlash from the industry. A joint letter published last week from more than 800 oil, engineering and business executives suggested the levy could cost up to 100,000 North Sea jobs and likened the potential impact of the windfall tax to the forced closure of coalmines by Thatcher’s government in the 1980s. Earlier at the conference, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, defended the proposals, arguing it was essential to Labour’s strategy to invest in the transition to net zero, boost Britain’s ailing industrial and energy infrastructure and fund a “British jobs bonus” to create green jobs. The shadow Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, described Yousaf’s position as “completely incoherent and out of touch”. “It beggars belief that Humza Yousaf thinks that a person earning more than £28,500 deserves to pay more tax but energy giants earning billions in profits from soaring bills should pay less,” he said. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, accused Yousaf of “masquerading as a friend of Scotland’s oil and gas industry”, saying: “The SNP have a longstanding ‘presumption against’ policy on all new oil and gas licences, they oppose Rosebank, [and] they were the first party to call for a windfall tax.”"

        "content": "Israel has gone “beyond reasonable self-defence” in its attack on Gaza, a Labour frontbencher has said, as the party prepares for a potentially difficult Commons vote on the crisis later this week.\nWes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said it was possible that Israel had broken international law in its military campaign, which has killed more than 28,000 people in Gaza since the 7 October massacre of Israelis by Hamas.\nStreeting said Labour had yet to decide how it would respond to an Scottish National party-led motion on calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, which is due to be debated on Wednesday.\nHe told Sky News: “We want to see a ceasefire, of course we do.

So I understand why people are vocal in calling for a ceasefire.”"

        "content": "Keir Starmer has said the “fighting must stop now” in Gaza, warning Israel not to extend its military offensive to the southern city of Rafah ahead of another potential crunch point for his party over the crisis. The Labour leader made the comments in a speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, where he has faced renewed pressure ahead of a crucial Commons vote on Wednesday over a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. “I have just returned from the Munich security conference, where every conversation I had came back to the situation in Israel and Gaza and the question of what we can do practically to deliver what we all want to see – a return of all the hostages taken on 7 October, an end to the killing of innocent Palestinians, a huge scaling-up of humanitarian relief and an end to the fighting,” he said. “Not just for now, not just for a pause, but permanently. A ceasefire that lasts. That is what must happen now. The fighting must stop now.” In a stance that has caused deep divisions across the Labour party, Starmer has previously refused to support calls for an “immediate” end to the violence, using the more cautious phrasing of a “sustainable ceasefire”. His speech came a day after the conference passed a motion that explicitly called for an immediate ceasefire on both sides and was endorsed by the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, who has previously been critical of Starmer’s more cautious stance. Labour faces another perilous vote in the Commons on Wednesday, with the Scottish National party tabling a motion calling for an immediate end to the violence. The party is desperate to avoid a repeat of last November’s significant rebellion over a similar SNP motion, when 56 Labour MPs defied the party whip to back it, with eight frontbenchers stepping down to do so, including Jess Phillips. Calling for a return to a “genuine peace process”, with a two-state solution back on the table, Starmer told Scottish Labour members on Sunday: “The offensive threatened on Rafah – a place where 1.5 million people are now cramped together in unimaginable conditions with nowhere else for them to go – this cannot become a new theatre of war. That offensive cannot happen.” The SNP has ramped up the pressure on Starmer, writing to backbenchers urging them to back its fresh motion. The party’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, published a letter inviting Starmer to a meeting on Monday to discuss the motion but making it “crystal clear” that the wording of the motion “must maintain the clarity of pressing for an immediate ceasefire”. After backing calls for an immediate ceasefire on Saturday, Sarwar suggested he was willing to work with the SNP, saying its Commons motion looked “pretty decent”. Sarwar said: “If we can send a unified message from the UK parliament, then we should take that opportunity and I hope people will engage in good faith in trying to find that unified position.” On Sunday, David Lammy sought to play down Wednesday’s vote, arguing that party political debates in Westminster were not going to achieve peace in the region.   Related: Starmer allies gripped by fear of Labour complacency amid byelection triumphs    “Yes, we will have a vote in parliament this week,” the shadow foreign secretary said. “But it’s not that vote that will bring about a ceasefire. It’s the diplomatic action, it’s Hamas, it’s Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s partners for peace saying the fighting must now stop.” Starmer also cautioned Scottish delegates – who appeared enthused and energised by their best-attended party conference in decades – against complacency, telling them there was still “a mountain to climb” to win back former Labour voters who had found a new political home with the SNP. He took on the SNP leader, Humza Yousaf, whose message to voters since the new year has been that Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland to win the general election”, and that SNP MPs will “keep [Starmer] honest” on issues such as child poverty and the green-energy transition. “No matter what the SNP say, the Tories can win the next election,” Starmer said. Addressing wavering voters, who polling indicates will be crucial to Labour’s election results across the UK, Starmer said: “I know there will always be a debate about Scotland’s constitutional future.  “If, right now, you want a Britain that places Scotland at the heart of the Westminster debate, if you want a politics that is committed to smashing the class ceiling … then that’s the change we can deliver for Scotland.”"

        "content": "Tory MPs critical of Rishi Sunak’s leadership are hoping he will stand down voluntarily to avoid the spectacle of a damaging coup and are looking to May’s local elections as a potential crunch point, the Guardian has been told. A former minister said several Conservative MPs had contacted Graham Brady, who heads the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, to say they want the prime minister to quit, but that they had not sent in letters of no confidence yet. The former minister said they believed Sunak’s Downing Street was too complacent about the risk he faces after no new public challenges emerged after two heavy byelection defeats for the party this week. “No 10 think they’re not in much trouble at all over a [leadership] challenge, which feels a bit arrogant,” they said. “Quite a lot of moderate MPs now agree with the traditional anti-Rishi types to say that the best course of action is not for us to remove him, but for him to stand down voluntarily, and they’re speaking to Graham Brady about it. That’s why you’re not hearing much noise about it. “I know it’s happening. The magnitude of it is difficult to say. It avoids the pain of removing a PM and might even prevent a protracted leadership contest, if one person emerges as a successor, like Rishi did.” The situation was less like the removal of Boris Johnson, they said, than “a slower-motion and less contentious Liz Truss”. “It’s not that they think Rishi is terrible, like she was. But he’s had a go for 18 months and the plan isn’t working,” they said. Since Labour won the Kingswood and Wellingborough seats, overturning sizeable Conservative majorities, Sunak has faced renewed calls from some of his MPs to tack further to the right on areas such as immigration and tax cuts, especially after Reform UK, formed by Nigel Farage, won 10%-plus of the vote in both contests. As yet no MPs have joined Simon Clarke and Andrea Jenkyns in calling publicly for him to go, but one Conservative source said many rebels had decided to wait and see how the party performed in local elections on 2 May. “This will be the crunch moment for a lot of those groups. That’s stick or twist time,” they said. “If the locals go badly, I would very much expect someone to launch a serious attempt to remove the PM. If Rishi is still PM on 31 May, he will be PM at the election.” Other Conservative MPs, however, have dismissed such ideas as unlikely and counterproductive. One long-serving backbencher said: “Never say never in politics, but I haven’t detected any signs from colleagues that we need to change the leader. Yes, some disagree on policy, but most people recognise that changing leaders literally months from an election is not a particularly good strategy. “I would quietly say to anyone unhappy with Rishi: he’s going to be going sooner or later anyway, most likely to the board of an investment bank, so you might as well wait for an election defeat.” Another former cabinet minister said: “One thing one always hears from voters is that they don’t like divided parties, so if anyone thinks the byelections mean we need to change leader, they’re taking the completely wrong lesson from them. “Also, when we have won elections, we have done so from the centre-right. So arguing that the answer is a leader who moves further to the right is also missing the point.” A government source said Sunak had achieved in a number of areas, including on tax cuts and migration: “His plan is a Conservative plan, it’s starting to work and only by sticking with it and uniting behind it can we take the fight to Labour.”"

        "content": "Yes, Rochdale does deserve better than the current byelection situation, but in her catalogue of the town’s political ills, Marina Hyde has made a significant omission (Conspiracists, chancers and a sexter – Rochdale deserves better, and frankly we all do, 13 February). For seven years, from June 2017 until January 2024, Rochdale had the best. We in Rochdale were fortunate enough to be represented by Tony Lloyd, the most dignified, principled and humane politician it has ever been my honour to know.  Tony’s death is still raw and he is still being mourned in Rochdale and right across the world. The 90 minutes of cross-party parliamentary tributes to him on 23 January pay tribute to his work and to the affection and esteem in which he is still held. Tony worked hard and spoke out loudly for the people of Rochdale, and his memory and achievements must not be cast aside in the pursuit of short-term sensationalism.Tricia AyrtonRochdale, Greater Manchester • The controversy over the Labour candidate for the Rochdale byelection provides a perfect opportunity for people there to send a powerful message to the main political parties that the climate crisis must be a priority. The people of Rochdale can vote for the Rev Mark Coleman, a local man and courageous climate campaigner, who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk. I do hope Rochdale voters grab this opportunity with both hands.Molly BerryMarsworth, Buckinghamshire • Thanks for reminding everyone of the tale of social disasters and depravities that Rochdale is now synonymous with (and there are others). My heart sank a bit further with each revelation – it’s listed as my birthplace on my passport and I sense I’m adversely judged whenever I need to submit it for scrutiny.  I just want to reset the story a bit by going back further – I grew up being very proud that Rochdale was the birthplace of the co-operative movement (drummed into me by my leftwing parents), so in 1844 the town had a good name. Can’t we just leave it there?David VaughanWaterford, Hertfordshire • This town gets a bad reputation for all the wrong reasons. Instead of looking at the renovation of the town’s infrastructure and incredible industry we are stuck with all these dreary stories of past horrors. Rochdale is a fantastic town that has struggled from deindustrialisation and, of course, Conservative cuts. But it is thriving, growing and developing. Come and look at the newly renovated Victorian town hall, new shopping centre, civic centre and trams. We don’t need a bunfight between a failed Labour candidate, a disgraced ex-Labour MP and the divisive George Galloway; we need a competent Labour MP to follow the excellent Tony Lloyd. Is that too much to ask?Donald EntwistleRochdale, Greater Manchester • Whereas I am inclined to agree with Marina Hyde regarding men who wear felt hats indoors, it is not true to say that medieval leprosy bells were cruel. Leprosy often affected the larynx, rendering the sufferer unable to speak. The bell was essential in order to attract attention and signal a request for alms. The relevance to the election might be the pressing need for candidates to become the voice of the nearly 7 million people on NHS waiting lists and the 2.8 million workers inactive through ill health.

        "published_date": "2024-02-18T16:04:03+00:00",
        "content": "Whatever its result, the next election will bring a wave of change to the House of Commons. So far, 90 of 650 sitting MPs have announced they will not be seeking re-election. Of those, 14 are former secretaries of state – 11 of them Tory – and nine are select committee chairs. This is the highest number of departing MPs since 2010, with more retirements expected to come. The exodus is greater on the Tory benches, which are on track for their biggest wave of departures since the 1997 Labour landslide. High-profile former cabinet ministers including Sajid Javid, Ben Wallace and Dominic Raab – all of whom in other circumstances might have risen further in their political careers – are among those stepping down. The 11 Conservative former secretaries of state who are leaving have nearly 40 years of cabinet experience between them. Now senior Tory figures are worried these departures will mean that, win or lose, the party will be left with a particularly inexperienced crop of MPs at the next election.   Related: Chris Grayling joins list of Tories standing down at next election   One Tory source said: “There’s this question of how much experience the new intake will have … We’re grappling with two huge foreign affairs crises. Where are the foreign affairs experts?” Nick Gibb, who has served three stints as schools minister adding up to more than a decade, and Tracey Crouch, the highly regarded sports minister between 2015 and 2018, are also standing down. As important as any minister to preserving Conservative party institutional knowledge is Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers. Brady has overseen three Tory leadership contests in the past five years but is among those who have announced he will not be seeking re-election. On the Labour side, a trio of grandees are leaving parliament – Harriet Harman, Margaret Beckett and Margaret Hodge, who are in their 70s and 80s. The long-serving former Labour chief whip Nick Brown, who announced his resignation from the party over a long-running investigation into a complaint against him, is also retiring. The fact that Tory MPs make up the majority of those leaving is unsurprising – there are more of them than MPs of any other party. But another main factor is Labour’s commanding lead in the polls, which has convinced many Tories to start thinking about life after politics. “We have been in power 14 years,” a Conservative MP who is retiring said. “A lot of people who are going have been ministers or secretaries of state. It’s likely we will go into opposition. A lot of them have done opposition – and you don’t like being in opposition.” Even MPs who have only been in parliament for less than a decade have had to contest a series of big votes in close succession – the election in 2015 was followed by the 2016 Brexit referendum, the 2017 election and the 2019 election. Philip Nye, who has been tracking the data for the Institute for Government, said: “There are quite a lot of big names this time: we’ve got Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock. It will be a lot of experience leaving parliament whoever wins the next election.” “A lot of those standing down now entered parliament in 2010 so have been here for 14 years. If you’ve been in office for a long time, people are looking to step away from public life and personal circumstances have changed. “Saying that, there will also be the factor of people weighing up their options – either because of the way the polls are looking, or because of boundary changes and the effect that that’s having.” The boundary changes mean several MPs find themselves with constituencies that have been altered beyond recognition. A few Tory MPs who have said they are not standing again are actually hunting for new seats to apply for. Jonathan Djanogly, the MP for Huntingdon, decided to step down after failing to get selected to stand in a newly redrawn constituency covering his area. Others have cited the growing challenges of being an MP, including threats and abuse. The justice minister, Mike Freer, announced he would not seek re-election after a string of incidents and threats, including a near-encounter with the man who went on to murder the former Southend West MP Sir David Amess. “Being an MP is just exhausting,” the retiring Conservative MP said. “Your time is not your own. Your family give up so much.”"

Of those, 14 are former secretaries of state – 11 of them Tory – and nine are select committee chairs. The exodus is greater on the Tory benches, which are on track for their biggest wave of departures since the 1997 Labour landslide. We look at the most prominent figures set to leave parliament. On the Tory benches Ben Wallace Wallace served as defence secretary for almost the entirety of Boris Johnson’s government, providing some stability to the brief during an otherwise tumultuous time in British politics. There were suggestions he might take a tilt at the Tory leadership but soon after he left the cabinet last summer he announced he would not be seeking re-election. Matt Hancock Hancock served as health secretary throughout the coronavirus pandemic until he was forced to resign after his lockdown rule-breaking affair with colleague Gina Coladangelo, now his partner, was exposed. There was no place for him in Rishi Sunak’s cabinet so he flew to Australia to participate in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! before announcing he would be seeking opportunities outside politics after the election. Sajid Javid First elected in 2010, Javid served continuously in cabinet from May 2014, when he was made culture secretary by David Cameron, until February 2020 when he quit as Johnson’s chancellor after a power struggle with Dominic Cummings. He announced in 2022 that he would not be seeking re-election. Dominic Raab The one-time Tory leadership contender served as one of Johnson’s, and then Sunak’s, most loyal lieutenants. He resigned as deputy prime minister and justice secretary last spring after an investigation into bullying complaints against him. His Esher and Walton constituency in Surrey is a top Lib Dem target and his decision to step down means he will avoid the potential embarrassment of losing his seat. Kwasi Kwarteng Kwarteng served as Johnson’s business secretary before his brief stint as chancellor in Liz Truss’s calamitous government. He announced he was standing down in February, on the same day Truss launched her new Popular Conservatism movement pushing for rightwing policies. Graham Brady As chair of the 1922 Committee, Brady has been the voice of backbench Conservatives since 2019. He has been the MP for Altrincham and Sale West since 1997 and announced last year that he was standing down, telling his local paper it was time to “bring this fascinating and fulfilling chapter of my life to a close”. His seat has only ever returned Conservative MPs but is now a Labour target. On the Labour benches Harriet Harman As parliament’s longest continuously serving female MP, Harman has earned the title of Mother of the House. She is also one of two women – alongside Margaret Beckett – to have served as acting leader of the Labour party. Last year she chaired the privileges committee inquiry that concluded that Johnson had deliberately misled parliament over “partygate”. Margaret Beckett First elected an MP in 1974, Beckett lost her seat in 1979 before returning to parliament in 1983 as the MP for Derby South. When she first entered parliament, just 27 MPs were women (there are now 220). She became the UK’s first female foreign secretary under Tony Blair and was Labour’s first female acting leader. She announced she was stepping down last year, saying she still had faith in politics despite the abuse and violence MPs face. Margaret Hodge First elected MP for Barking in 1994 in a byelection, Hodge became well known for her chairing of the public accounts select committee. She was a fierce critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership over antisemitism, and has since been supportive of Keir Starmer. In a video message announcing her intention to stand down, she said her proudest moment in politics was beating Nick Griffin, the then British National party leader, when he contested the Barking seat in 2010."

        "content": "Neil Kinnock has said he is “convinced” that Labour will win the next election, although the former party leader said the race could not be compared to 1992 or 1997. Kinnock has previously blamed a moment of complacency ahead of the 1992 general election, when he was Labour leader, for costing the party victory over John Major’s Conservatives, who won an unexpected 21-seat majority. Taking to the stage at a huge rally in Sheffield a week before the election, Kinnock appeared to respond to the crowd by shouting: “We’re all right!” three times – although he subsequently said the yell had actually been: “Well, all right!”, to acknowledge the applause. Asked whether the next election was shaping up to be more like 1992 or 1997, Kinnock told Sky’s Sunday with Trevor Philips programme it would be “neither ’92 or ’97, or ’45 or ’83 – it’s going to be ’24, because every single election is different.” He went on: “Even when we had two elections in one year in 1974, between 28 February and the October election, there were two different elections and the same factors were at play, but the way in which it evolved, the way in which it turned out, was different. “So I don’t think people can examine the archaeology of ’97 and ’92, and ’87 and whatever else. But then there are parallels.” Asked if he was confident about Labour’s chances, Kinnock replied: “I’m convinced now that we’re not going to lose.” Pressed on this, he said: “I will go no further than that.” He cited the way the first-past-the-post electoral system could expand small differences in vote shares into very different numbers of MPs, saying that the difference between a Conservative and Labour majority was 1,240 votes, which was the total of the 11 smallest Tory majorities. “In a first past the post system, you’re going to get the narrowest of shifts – busloads of people, carloads of people – determining who’s going to be the member of parliament,” he said. “So I a long time ago gave up trying to guess by how much anybody could win or lose.” But later in the interview, when asked if he expected to see Keir Starmer in No 10, Kinnock replied: “Yes, and I look forward to that very much because I think he would be a mature, dependable leader of a party, and by God, we all need that now.”  However caveated his views, Kinnock’s confidence in a Labour win is likely to prompt some unease among Starmer’s team because of wider worries within the party about complacency. This concern has heightened after Labour easily won byelections last week in two previously safe Conservative seats, Wellingborough and Kingswood. The former saw the Tories’ largest drop in vote share in a byelection since 1945."

        "content": "David Lammy has described the death toll in Gaza as “abominable” as he sought to play down a Scottish National party vote next week on a ceasefire, arguing that party political debates in Westminster were not going to achieve peace in the region.\nAhead of another potential crunch point for Labour over whether or not to back a call for a ceasefire, Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the main point was that everyone wanted to see the violence stop.\n“We all want to see an end to the fighting,” he told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show. “Over 28,000 people have lost their lives, women and children. One of my children is adopted – [there are] 17,000 orphans now in Gaza. It’s just abominable. So of course people want to see a ceasefire.\n“The question now is how, and to be absolutely clear that when that ceasefire comes, we can’t see the fighting restart.”\nThe SNP is planning to table a motion to be debated in the Commons on Wednesday, which would set out the party’s call for an immediate ceasefire, something supported by a number of Labour MPs but not by Keir Starmer and his frontbench, who have called instead for a sustainable end to the violence.\nA similar SNP motion in November, in the form of an amendment to the king’s speech, saw 56 Labour MPs defy the party whip to back it, with eight frontbenchers stepping down to do so, including Jess Phillips.\nThe language used by Starmer and Lammy regarding a possible ceasefire has changed over the subsequent months, as the death toll has risen as a result of the Israeli military action in response to the 7 October massacre of Israelis by Hamas.\nSpeaking as he attended the Munich security conference on Saturday, Starmer said Labour would need to study the SNP motion: “We’ll have to look at the precise wording. But I’m very clear that we all want a ceasefire. The question therefore is how do we get there?”\nAsked about how the party would respond, Lammy said he had not yet seen the full motion and so could not say, but added that it was to an extent a sideshow.\n“Yes, we will have a vote in parliament this week,” he said. “But it’s not that vote that will bring about a ceasefire. It’s the diplomatic action, it’s Hamas, it’s Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s partners for peace saying the fighting must now stop.\n“Given the tremendous loss of life, given the fact that we have said in my party that we need now to have Palestinian recognition as a roadmap to that peace, we’ve got to get to a two-state solution.\n“You can see that the complexity of this does require us to look carefully at a motion, not to comment on words that are flying around social media. I just don’t think that’s the place to conduct proper diplomacy.”\nIn an earlier interview, Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, whose conference passed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire on Saturday, sought to play down differences with the Starmer and Lammy view.\n“I actually don’t think there is much difference,” he told Sky’s Sunday with Trevor Philips programme. “Keir, yesterday at the Munich security conference, was talking about the need for a ceasefire.\n“He has said he wants the fighting to stop right now, he just said he wants immediate access to humanitarian aid, he just said he wants the immediate release of hostages, and he said he wants to see that pathway to a two-state solution.”"

        "content": "The number of civil investigation cases opened by a HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) fraud unit investigating offshore, corporate and wealthy taxpayers has fallen by more than half in five years, figures reveal. The Observer reported last month that HMRC has not charged a single company under landmark legislation to crack down on tax evasion. Campaigners warned that HMRC was undermining its own deterrents by failing to use its criminal enforcement powers. The new figures, obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, suggest that the tax authority’s civil enforcement in its fraud investigation service has also declined alongside its use of criminal powers.  Civil investigations opened by the offshore, corporate and wealthy unit, part of HMRC’s fraud investigation service, fell from 1,417 in 2018-19 to 627 in 2022-23. HMRC says its fraud investigation service is focusing on the highest-value tax fraud and the figures do not take account of overall compliance activity, with 300,000 compliance “interventions” opened in 2022-23.   Related: EU-funded report calls for wealth of super-rich to be taxed, not income   HMRC has faced scrutiny in recent years over offshore tax avoidance and evasion. Figures disclosed to the independent thinktank Tax Policy Associates by HMRC in September 2021 revealed that UK taxpayers held nearly £570bn in tax havens, which would include offshore funds.  HMRC said in a freedom of information response to the thinktank that it had not “produced or received any estimates” as to what proportion of the accounts were properly disclosed. In June 2022, Lucy Frazer, then financial secretary to the Treasury, said HMRC would produce data on the “offshore tax gap” in 2023. This data has not been published as pledged. Margaret Hodge MP called on HMRC to “finally crack down on egregious tax avoidance and collect the revenues we desperately need”. “The new revelations that HMRC is failing to make up for [declining numbers of criminal prosecutions] by undertaking more civil investigations is just disgraceful,” said Hodge. “These consecutive failures mean tax dodgers and their enablers can continue getting away scot-free.” Stephen Daly, senior lecturer in corporate law at King’s College London, said: “If you don’t enforce the rules, then you create a culture in which people don’t have to worry about their tax returns later being checked.” Civil inquiries and investigations declined sharply in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic interrupted HMRC’s enforcement activity. But despite a significant rise last year, the number of cases remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The number of civil cases that were formally opened by the fraud investigation service, which can examine the tax affairs of any taxpayer, fell by 28% in the same period, from 17,424 from 2018/19 to 12,585 in 2022/23. “Even when [HMRC is] opening civil cases, they appear to be going after the easier, lower-value targets,” said Fiona Fernie, a partner at tax adviser Blick Rothenberg. Last year, HMRC reached one of its highest-ever tax settlements when ex-Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone paid more than £650m after pleading guilty to tax fraud – but that success was “the exception, not the rule”, said Fernie. Part of the problem is that the UK has an increasingly complex tax code system, which makes enforcement action difficult, she said. “The staff are under considerable pressure; we get an increasingly complicated system every year, and it’s very difficult to get anybody to keep up with it.” Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said another issue was lack of resources. “We know HMRC is underfunded and resources have been diverted for work on Covid and Brexit,” he said. HMRC estimates that it collects 95% of all the tax owed in the UK, a proportion it says has remained stable in recent years. However, it estimates that the remaining 5% still accounts for about £36bn. Palmer said: “Parliamentary research shows that when the government invests in HMRC, the return on investment is significant. Until the department is properly funded, vast sums of money owed, often by the richest people and companies, will go unrecovered.” A HMRC spokesperson said: “These specific figures relate solely to the work of our fraud investigation service and do not take account of our overall compliance activity. In 2022-23, we opened 300,000 compliance interventions across a range of tax risks, including avoidance and evasion, and secured £34bn in additional tax revenue. “Since 2018-19, we’ve opened more than 1.5m compliance interventions, securing £136bn.” HMRC says work is continuing on estimating figures for the offshore tax gap."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak is being warned he risks taking his party further towards disaster by sanctioning a new public spending squeeze in a desperate pursuit of pre-election tax cuts, as more Tories said they feared an election wipeout. With more infighting erupting this weekend after two huge byelection losses in former safe seats, Treasury officials are examining cuts to public spending should they be needed to fund tax cuts, demanded most vociferously by the right of the party. However, with new polling seen by the Observer showing little public appetite for raising money through further spending reductions, senior Tories warned that it risked taking the party further away from the concerns of key voters turning to Labour. John Gummer, the former Tory chairman, now Lord Deben, said the party risked alienating the critical group. “We have to look at the things that the public are really concerned about – they are concerned, for example, about the need for more nurses,” he said. “They’re concerned about radical reform of the health service. “The priority for most people at the moment is to improve public services to make sure that those who are least well off are looked after and to make it more attractive to work. Conservatives are not dogmatists. And the people who call themselves Conservative sometimes are not at all. The majority of Conservative MPs – and majority of Conservative voters – want a moderate, sensible, progressive party.” It comes with Tory moderates claiming that Sunak must not turn the party into “Reform UK-lite” in response to the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections last week. Reform UK, formerly the Brexit party, came third in both seats, prompting demands from the Tory right for firmer action on tax and immigration.   Related: Conservatives will never win by being Reform UK–lite   Writing in the Observer, former cabinet minister Justine Greening said concerns that the party could face annihilation should it veer further to the right were valid. “Those who warn that the party faces an ‘extinction event’ at the forthcoming election are right,” she writes. “It’s because, time and time again, the party has consistently chosen to play up to the negative, simplistic, culture wars-driven rhetoric of Ukip and latterly, Reform UK. “The Conservative party has been heading down a political cul-de-sac for some time. It might have felt like moving forwards, but the reality was different for voters. Now the party is hitting the end of the road. It will be a long way back, but the journey needs to start now.” With the mood darkening on the Tory benches, one former cabinet minister said they increasingly feared a 1997 Labour landslide. “The slogan then was ‘Britain is booming. Don’t let Labour ruin it.’ It didn’t change a thing.” A loyal former minister said: “It’s going to be severe.”   Related: Starmer allies gripped by fear of Labour complacency amid byelection triumphs    The budget next month is seen as one of the last chances for the Tories to seize the momentum from Labour. With chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s headroom for tax cuts becoming tighter, his officials are searching for spending cuts in the next parliament that could be deployed to fund a further giveaway if necessary. However, asked how they would like a chancellor to raise money after the election, only one in 10 voters back public spending cuts. Only 17% of those who voted Conservative in 2019 opted for spending cuts. Overall, 41% of voters preferred increasing taxes on business, according to a YouGov poll for the WPI Strategy consultancy. Meanwhile, an Opinium poll for the Observer found Labour has a 15-point lead, down from 18 points last week. A fierce internal Tory battle has intensified after last week’s byelections. John Hayes, a senior MP on the right, said time was running out for his party to close down the threat from Reform and deliver a “more Conservative” government. “We have the opportunity in the budget to show them we’re on the side of hard-working, law-abiding people – and we’re not going to continue to fund unrestricted welfare payments: we’re going to invest in British manufacturers and British businesses,” he said. “That means backing the high streets, backing British manufacturers, backing British food producers. It needs to be a patriot’s budget.” However, Damian Green, chair of the One Nation caucus of liberal Tories, said: “Anyone who thinks you can simply add the Reform party’s votes to Tory votes by adopting some of their policies is living in a fantasy world.” Nick Faith, the director of WPI Strategy, said Hunt would “go down in flames” if he opted to fund tax cuts with lower public spending. “Reducing funding into hospitals, schools and other local services would be the most unpopular thing the chancellor could do,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that targeted tax cuts are an impossibility. But they need to fall within the existing headroom set out by the Office for Budgetary Responsibility. Paying for a reduction in something like inheritance tax via reductions in public spending would literally be the definition of crazy.” While it has been a bruising week for Sunak, his team does not believe the byelection losses have revealed anything new about the challenge they face. They have also been encouraged by the difficulties Labour faced after ditching its plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment and having to abandon byelection candidate Azhar Ali after he repeated a conspiracy theory about Israel. “When we put Labour under sustained pressure, there are cracks that we can exploit – people have been reassured,” said one senior Tory source. “Back before 2015, we were losing byelections, including to Ukip. But the mission for us is building an offer at the election that we think people will back as a choice over Labour. We face a massive challenge, but we’re not despondent.”"

        "content": "For the past few months, with Labour enjoying a stubbornly large double-digit lead in the polls, close allies of Keir Starmer remained obsessed with the notion that complacency will slip into the mindsets of MPs, advisers and activists. In a breathless week that saw Labour veer from having to abandon one byelection before scooping previously safe Tory seats in two others, the obsessives were given three opportunities to drive their point home. The first was the most alarming. When it emerged that the party’s experienced Rochdale byelection candidate Azhar Ali had told a private meeting that Israel “allowed” the 7 October attacks by Hamas, an initial decision was made to stand by him – a move described as “terrible” by some in the shadow cabinet. After it was then revealed he had said “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were fuelling criticism of a pro-Palestinian MP, the decision was taken to cut him loose. “The truth is, they’re just a bit slow at decision-making,” said one shadow minister. “It’s as simple as that.” For a leader who listed changing the party and weeding out antisemitism as one of his central achievements, it could scarcely have been worse. For the complacency hawks, it served as a reminder of the vigilance needed. “You’ve got to use all these things to strengthen what you do,” said one senior figure. “We’ve changed the party at an absolute rapid speed. But you can just tell in the last week why the risk of complacency around party change is there. There’s a reminder for the whole party: it’s not that long ago we were a party Jewish people feared about getting into government.” There was also fury within the leader’s office over comments from Ed Balls. The former shadow chancellor defended Graham Jones, another candidate suspended for comments made at the same meeting attended by Ali. Balls said Jones was “not a Corbynite, not hard left – absolutely not anti-Israel”. That angered those dealing with the row. “It is a sign of an organisation that is not voter-focused,” said one. “Irrespective of what wing of the party you come from, party change needs to be a permanent change. You can’t backslide.” The second moment for complacency hunters came as Labour’s bad week suddenly ended in celebration, as the party scooped two more previously safe Tory seats in the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections and watched a beleaguered Rishi Sunak blame “midterm” difficulties (the election is now just months away). Once again, it was taken by several shadow cabinet ministers as a cue to reprimand those celebrating too early. “You just keep getting people talking as if the next election has already been won at all levels – whether that’s MPs, party members, Labour party supporters. There’s a sense of: ‘The next election is won – so why aren’t we doing more of this or more of that’, including whatever their pet project is,” said one shadow cabinet member. “The election hasn’t happened. Not a single vote has been cast. Byelections have been fantastic, but byelections are not a general election.” The third moment came in the form of new analysis passed to Starmer’s team last week. It contained fresh modelling designed to answer that ultimate question: whatever the polls say now, how may voters behave when the election arrives? In a counter to models based on current polling, such as one in the last week that put Labour on course for an improbable 254-seat majority, the document examines several scenarios. Its central scenario is one that many Labour pessimists believe is the most likely – where many voters who say they “don’t know” who they will back return to the party they supported at the last election, while wavering Tory switchers head back to Sunak. It leaves Labour with a workable 78-seat majority – roughly the size of that enjoyed by Boris Johnson, but not 1997 all over again. It also contains a scenario of a Reform UK collapse. That would see Labour with 312 seats and no majority at all. It was “very helpful in concentrating minds”, said one senior figure. Josh Simons, director of the Labour Together group, which conducted the analysis, said: “For years, the evidence has shown that months out from an election, voters answer a different question to the one pollsters intend. They report dissatisfaction with the government, not the judgment they will make alone in the ballot box on polling day. He added: “The Westminster bubble thinks Labour has it in the bag. But in recent years the bubble has had an excellent track record of getting it wrong. Those who want a new government in Britain would be unwise, even for a moment, to be complacent.” Even as party officials worry away about how and when things can go wrong, they do not have to wait long for a new threat.   Related: Starmer facing test of authority as ‘immediate’ Gaza ceasefire vote looms   This week, the Scottish National party (SNP) plans to hold a new Commons vote calling for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza – a demand that goes further than Starmer’s backing for a “sustainable ceasefire”. A series of frontbenchers have already had to step down in order to back a similar SNP motion in November. Labour has not yet announced how it will order MPs to vote, but the issue is causing agonies for many Labour MPs this weekend. “People are seriously worried – we’re talking about a Labour rebellion of 100 plus if we don’t have a decent amendment,” said one MP who backed the previous motion. Others were anxious to know if they were going to be ordered to oppose or abstain. One senior MP said there would be a serious backlash from MPs and voters, including liberal voters the party relies on in some seats, should their party not back the motion. “People like me will back that unless they are going to threaten us with suspension,” they said. While Labour’s strong poll lead means analysts do not believe seats will be lost because of its position on Gaza, MPs with large Muslim communities and big groups of leftwing, liberal voters – already concerned by Labour ditching its pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment – are nervous. Discipline will be severely tested. In an open letter to Labour MPs seen by the Observer, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, made a direct appeal to them. “Since Westminster rejected a ceasefire in November, more than 28,000 Palestinian children, women and men have been killed – and huge swathes of Gaza have been obliterated, including hospitals and family homes,” he writes. “More than a million Palestinians have been displaced – and the population is facing a growing humanitarian crisis. “The intolerable situation in Gaza is far more important than any narrow party loyalties – and it places a moral duty on all of us to act … For those Labour MPs who are wavering, I urge you to press Keir Starmer to change his position. “If he won’t, I urge you to be on the right side of history and join us in doing the only right thing by voting for an immediate ceasefire now.” And beyond the immediate problems posed by the SNP vote, there is the prospect of the Rochdale byelection later this month that the party will now not contest. Labour’s withdrawal of support for Ali means there is a much better chance for George Galloway, the former Labour MP who has previously displaced the party in two other seats. He is campaigning relentlessly on Gaza and Starmer’s refusal to back an immediate ceasefire. Should Galloway claim victory, he will have six months to heap pressure on Labour MPs over the issue in the House of Commons. If that is the case, the party’s ability to deal with crises – while maintaining that prized poll lead – may soon be tested to an even greater extent within weeks."

        "content": "Keir Starmer considered resigning as Labour party leader after the defeat in the Hartlepool byelection in 2021, according to a new biography. The loss of the County Durham constituency to the Conservatives was a blow to Starmer as the party had held the seat since it was created in 1974. Nearly two and a half years later, Labour are ahead in the polls and achieved a double success by winning the byelections in Wellingborough and Kingswood on Friday. A new book on the Labour leader, serialised in the Times, suggests that the Holborn and St Pancras MP told close aides in the immediate aftermath of the Hartlepool defeat that he was going to quit before being persuaded to stay. Chris Ward, a former close aide, told the biographer Tom Baldwin: “Keir kept saying that he felt he would have to go, that the result showed the party was going backwards and he saw it as a personal rejection. I told him it was far too soon for that kind of thing, but it was a rocky few hours.”   Related: Labour seeking SNP deal to avoid new Gaza ceasefire rebellion   Starmer, who became Labour leader in April 2020, reflected on the defeat in the book. He said: “I’m not fulfilling some lifelong dream here. I could happily work in the bookshop or something.” According to the book, Starmer’s wife, Vic, was among those who urged him not to act too hastily. Another key figure who helped keep Starmer in his post was Morgan McSweeney, who remains Labour’s highly influential director of campaigns. Starmer has also responded to Donald Trump’s threat not to protect countries he believes do not pay enough to maintain Nato, saying he would “stand up for our allies” if he becomes prime minister. The Labour leader told the Sunday Telegraph: “We must build, renew and resource, not divide and threaten. Bad faith politics risks our security.” Labour has had a fruitful few days after achieving its largest swing in a byelection since 1994 after overturning a majority of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. Gen Kitchen won with 13,844 votes, beating the Conservatives’ Helen Harrison who received 7,408 votes. In Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, Labour overturned an 11,220 Tory majority to win Chris Skidmore’s former seat. Damien Egan won 11,176 votes, while the Tory candidate, Sam Bromiley, polled 8,675, giving Labour a majority of 2,501. They were the ninth and 10th byelection defeats for the government since the 2019 general election."

        "content": "Labour is hoping to defuse a fresh crisis over Keir Starmer’s cautious stance on Gaza by rewording a Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. With the support of Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, the SNP will table a motion to be debated in the Commons on Wednesday, which intends to challenge Starmer by calling for an immediate end to the violence. Labour is desperate to avoid a repeat of last November’s sizeable rebellion by MPs over Starmer’s stance, which saw 56 Labour MPs back a similar SNP motion and three shadow spokespeople resign. In an attempt to crank up the pressure on Starmer, Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader, published an open letter to Labour backbenchers urging them to back their fresh motion. “For more than four months, the UK has followed the strategy of equivocation supported by Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer,” Flynn’s letter stated. “The devastation shows it hasn’t worked. The time for equivocation is over.” He released it as Scottish Labour’s leader, Anas Sarwar, who has previously been highly critical of Starmer’s early caution, endorsed a motion at the party’s annual conference in Glasgow on Saturday that explicitly called for an immediate ceasefire on both sides. Speaking to delegates on Friday, Sarwar said he believed the “fighting must stop”, adding: “That means an immediate ceasefire with an end to rocket fire going in to, and coming out of, Gaza right now. “It means the immediate release of hostages; immediate access to humanitarian aid [and] crucially, immediate efforts by world leaders to forge a path to an enduring peace and a two-state solution.” Starmer has repeatedly avoided using the word “immediate” and has instead called for a “sustainable” ceasefire, perhaps to avoid the risk that Hamas and its Islamist allies in Gaza will fail to adhere to it, leaving Labour to appear naive. Yet he has edged closer to Sarwar’s position recently. In an interview with Sky on the sidelines of the Munich security conference on Saturday, Starmer confirmed his aides were studying the SNP motion to see if a deal could be struck. “We’ll have to look at the precise wording. But I’m very clear that we all want a ceasefire. The question therefore is how do we get there?” With pro-Palestinian campaigners protesting outside the conference venue, Sarwar told reporters in Glasgow there was little difference between Labour and the SNP, or between him and Starmer, over the need for an urgent end to the violence. He said Labour whips and Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, wanted talks with Flynn in an effort to draft a motion Labour could endorse. “It looks like a pretty decent motion,” Sarwar said. “If we can send a unified message from the UK parliament then we should take that opportunity and I hope people will engage in good faith in trying to find that unified position. “In the end, that is more important than two political parties having a go at each other when in actual fact what matters is the people living in Israel and Palestine who are fearing for their lives.” Yousaf said the onus was on Labour to make its position on Gaza clear. “The real proof of the pudding will be what UK Labour chooses to do when the SNP brings a vote for a ceasefire once again to the House of Commons,” he said. One Scottish Labour councillor was cheered by delegates when he said the conference “demanded” that Scottish Labour’s two MPs back the ceasefire motion next week. Pauline McNeill, one of Sarwar’s allies and his justice spokesperson at Holyrood, said fighting for an independent Palestinian state was “the moral question of our time. Labour must not only call for the two-state solution, we must fight for the two-state solution.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has called on British conservatives to “come together” after two heavy byelection losses to Labour. The loss of votes to Labour and an emboldened Reform UK party came as a twin blow to the prime minister, and were just the latest in a series of byelection defeats for Sunak. The results mean the current Conservative government has endured more byelection losses than any administration since the 1960s, surpassing the eight defeats suffered by John Major in the run-up to Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide victory. Sunak, who had sought to play down the losses as “difficult” midterm elections, wrote a column for the Telegraph published on Friday night, calling on rightwing and conservative voters to unite to keep Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, out of 10 Downing Street. He said: “Later this year, we will have a general election that will decide who governs our country. I am confident that by then we will have made more progress, that the plan will be delivering the security and opportunity that people crave. “At the next election, I will need the support of everyone who wants lower taxes and secure borders because the alternative, Keir Starmer, believes in neither of those things. “The Conservative family must come together to defeat Labour and ensure a brighter future for our country. A vote for anyone other than the Conservatives will just help Starmer.” The Wellingborough byelection was triggered by the six-week Commons suspension of the former Tory MP Peter Bone after an inquiry found he had subjected a staff member to bullying and sexual misconduct. Meanwhile, the Kingswood vote came after former Conservative MP Chris Skidmore resigned in protest over government legislation to increase North Sea oil and gas drilling. The results came as a boost to Labour after a difficult few days, with the party gripped by a row over antisemitism and reeling from the decision to drop its Rochdale byelection candidate, Azhar Ali. Responding to the Labour wins, Starmer said: “I think there is a message now from these byelections … I think the country is crying out for change. Everybody knows that. “Things aren’t working. Their NHS isn’t working. They’ve got a cost-of-living crisis. I think they’ve concluded that the Tories have failed after 14 years.” The results are placing further pressure on Sunak from within the right of his party to “change course” with tax cuts and a harder stance on immigration to win back voters wooed by the Nigel Farage-linked Reform party. The defeats also capped a tricky few days for Sunak, after official figures showed the UK entered a technical recession at the end of last year. The Tories have now clocked up more byelection defeats than any other government in a single parliament since Harold Wilson’s 1960s Labour administration. It also means the party has suffered the most losses of any Conservative administration within any single parliament since the second world war. The Conservatives sought to put a gloss on the results by highlighting low turnout, which stood at 37% in Kingswood and 38% in Wellingborough. But Labour overturned majorities of 11,220 and 18,540 respectively, the government’s ninth and 10th byelection defeats of the current parliament and securing the second-largest swing from the Tories ever."
