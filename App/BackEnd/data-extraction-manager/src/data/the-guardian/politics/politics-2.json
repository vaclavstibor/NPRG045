        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been urged to push through new rules to block anyone convicted of a sexual offence from standing to be an MP before the next election. At least six MPs have lost their seats because of alleged sexual misconduct since the 2019 general election, and 10 MPs have been suspended from their parties pending investigations. While all political parties have their own procedures for vetting MP hopefuls, politicians and unions believe formal rules to block relevant candidates will make it easier to “weed out the bad apples”. A former minister said: “I can’t believe this has to become formal policy, but history shows how bad the working environment in Westminster has become for this to be needed. Working standards for people on the estate are at a pretty low bar.” The Prospect union said Sunak should introduce the measures before the next election, as well as accelerating the timetable in risk-based exclusion measures. “If they won’t, Labour should do so as a matter of urgency if they win the next general election,” said Mike Clancy, general secretary of the union. It comes as the Scottish parliament is expected to vote through rules to bar anyone convicted of a sexual offence and subject to a restriction order from standing to be an MSP or as a councillor. Ministers in Edinburgh published plans last year to cover council elections and said they believed it was logical to extend these controls to candidates for Holyrood, which has 129 MSPs, at the same time. Like councillors, MSPs were in a position of power and authority and often dealt with vulnerable constituents, an official briefing paper said. The controls are due to be included in the new Scottish elections (representation and reform) bill introduced last month. “The roots of this move are grounded in both protecting the public in personal encounters with elected representatives and also a more general reputational concern based on trust and confidence,” the briefing paper said. While no MSP at Holyrood has been jailed for sexual offences, and none have been prosecuted, there have been a series of controversies over sexual misconduct by MSPs, with some losing ministerial posts. Scottish ministers point out the current rules allow people to stand for Holyrood if they were jailed for less than a year: that could allow some sex offenders to do so. The rules for council elections are tougher, barring anyone with a sentence of three months or greater standing for election. A ban on sex offenders standing in council elections, including mayoral elections, came into force across England in 2022 and Wales in 2021, when a similar ban on sex offenders standing for the Senedd in Cardiff came into force. There is no specific bar on sex offenders standing for councils in Northern Ireland, other than a blanket ban on anyone with recent prison sentences of three months or more. No specific bar is in place for Stormont elections as its elections are governed by Westminster and are similar to those for the Commons. In December, the House of Commons commission published proposals for a “risk-based exclusion policy” to bar MPs who have been arrested for violent or sexual offences from coming on to the parliamentary estate. But there is no policy that stops anyone convicted of a sexual offence from becoming an MP. Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: “Constituents should have the same protections in relation to MPs as they would any other elected representative, across the whole of the UK. It is the least that constituents should be able to expect, but it’s quite astonishing it isn’t in place already.” The Liberal Democrats said they would “carefully consider proposals in this area, including bringing the rules for parliamentary candidates in line with those that exist already for those standing to be local councillors”. Labour has not clarified if it would roll out such measures in government, if the Conservatives fail to do so. But Lucy Powell, the shadow Commons leader, said “the government should stop dragging their feet and do so without delay” in rolling out a risk-based exclusions policy."

        "content": "Keir Starmer paid £99,431 in UK tax on income of £404,030 last year, according to a summary released by the Labour party. The Labour leader’s tax summary for 2022-23 was published a week after Rishi Sunak’s, which revealed the prime minister paid more than £508,208 in UK tax last year on income of just over £2.2m. Starmer earned £128,291 from his salaries as an MP and leader of the opposition, and paid £44,308 in income tax in 2022-23. He also paid £52,688 in capital gains tax on income of £275,739 from the sale of a field in December 2022. The field was partly owned by himself and his father’s estate. It was previously reported that Starmer had sold a plot of land he had bought in the 1990s for his parents, who used it to care for neglected donkeys. Similarly to Sunak, Starmer published “a summary” of his UK taxable income, capital gains and tax paid over the last tax year as reported to HMRC, prepared by chartered accountants. The one-page document showed that he earned £79,098 as an MP, with an added salary of £49,193 for his role as leader of the opposition.   Related: Rishi Sunak paid effective tax rate of 23% on £2.2m income last year   Sunak’s tax summary, published by Downing Street, showed that he paid £163,364 in tax on a total income of £432,884. He also paid £359,240 in tax on about £1.8m in capital gains from a US-based investment fund. The prime minister first published his tax return in 2023, showing he had made nearly £5m over the previous three years due mostly to his US investment fund income. Sunak’s personal wealth and his links to the US have been sensitive issues for him. • This article, including the headline, was amended on 19 February 2024 to distinguish more clearly between Keir Starmer’s overall income and his earnings as an MP and opposition leader."

        "content": "For Reform UK to win 13% of the vote in a byelection is a long way from the heady days of Ukip taking 60% in Clacton in 2014. However, that share of the vote was still a shock for the Conservatives on Friday morning, given that Reform is a newer party without the draw of Nigel Farage as leader or the rallying cause of Brexit behind it. When a rightwing government has lost two byelections to a centre-left opposition, it would seem a strange response for the prime minister to veer further to the right. Nevertheless, the loudest voices urging Sunak to change path on Friday were those of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and the founders of the New Conservatives parliamentary group – Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger – who, instead of seeing Labour as the biggest threat, claimed that uniting the “Tory family” of Reform and Conservative voters would be a winning strategy. Many polling experts were quick to say such an approach did not make sense. Straightforwardly adding the Conservative vote share of 25% and Reform’s 13% does not match the Labour vote share of 46% in Wellingborough. Luke Tryl of the thinktank More in Common pointed out that in any case it was “really important to remember not all Reform votes come from the Tories and even fewer would go back to the Tories in the absence of Reform, so you really can’t add the two vote shares together as a ‘reunited right’.” Sunak and the Tory party chair, Richard Holden, downplayed the impact of the Reform vote, suggesting it would melt away when people were confronted with the stark choice at a general election of who they wanted as the next prime minister. The risk for the Conservatives might be greater if Farage were to fully throw his weight behind Reform, which claims it plans to stand candidates in every seat. However, the former Ukip and Brexit party leader, who helped Boris Johnson in 2019 by standing aside in places with an incumbent Tory MP, is yet to decide whether he really wants to cause damage to the Conservatives. “The danger of Reform is exaggerated,” said a Tory MP in the One Nation group. “Byelections show protest parties getting many more votes, but things change in an actual general election.”   Related: Tory MPs warn Sunak veering further right would be ‘politically disastrous’   Conservative moderates tend to be far more worried about Labour – or in some seats the Liberal Democrats – taking their former voters on issues such as the cost of living, housing and the NHS. However, the right of the Conservative party still appeared determined to learn the wrong lesson from Labour’s byelection wins: not that there is a mood for change and that Starmer is consistently polling as more trusted and competent than Sunak, but that a minority of voters want more rightwing policies. More centrist Conservatives believe that is a wrong-headed conclusion and that elections are fought and won only on the centre ground of politics. Johnson’s 2019 victory was, after all, contested not just on the issue of Brexit but on a platform of increased public spending on police, hospitals and levelling up, which struck a chord in the north and the Midlands. Sunak has shown himself consistently buffeted by the right of the party into doubling down on the Rwanda policy despite evidence that it is illegal; delaying net zero goals; and now heading for tax cuts and a fresh round of austerity, when experts warn it would be an unwise move during a recession. He has so far withstood the siren calls of those pressing him to go into the next election promising to withdraw from the European court of human rights, but the temptation will be there to do that as a clear dividing line with Starmer. The question is who Sunak will listen to, having sided with the right for much of his premiership so far."

        "content": "My cousin Mary Wane, who has died aged 99, had a long career with the British Council from the end of the second world war onwards, promoting British culture to other parts of Europe. She began her work at the council in 1945 with a posting to Austria as an interpreter for the occupying allied forces. After returning from Vienna in 1947, she was based in London with the British Council, but travelled extensively for the organisation in Europe, promoting educational links and exchanges with other European countries, including the Soviet Union, and organising exhibitions of the work of British artists such as Henry Moore and David Hockney. By 1968 she was working for the council in Oslo, and from 1972 to 1979 she was its cultural attache in Paris. Made OBE in 1977, her final posting was back in Oslo, as director (1979-84), before she retired to Cumbria, where she contributed to the arts and political life of the Lake District. Born in Manchester, Mary was the daughter of Charlotte (nee Kennedy) and Norman Wane, an accountant. She went to Blackburne House school for girls in Liverpool, to where the family had moved, and gained a degree in modern languages at Liverpool University. She spent a short period as a junior civil servant in 1945 before joining the British Council. Her early years there were some of the happiest of her life – not just professionally but socially, as she sang with the Chelsea Opera Group, which she later helped to run. For many years Mary was also an active member of the Labour party, but by 1981 she had joined the newly formed SDP. In retirement she worked hard for the Liberal Democrats. Living in the small town of Windermere, she served as a Lib Dem councillor for Cumbria county council until 1997, and was known for establishing strong cross-party links. She also carried out research on Cumbrian matters for The Victoria History of the Counties of England project, and was a founder patron and committee member of the Lake District summer music festival, remaining a powerful force in its organisation well into her 90s. She is survived by her nephew, Tim, niece, Mary, and eight cousins."

        "content": "\n 4.06pm GMT \nEnd of day summary …\n\nWe are going to be wrapping up the live blog shortly. Here are the headlines …\n\nKeir Starmer has hailed Labour’s “fantastic” results in the Kingswood and Wellingborough byelections after the party secured two victories that suggest the party is on course for a majority at the general election this year. The party secured a near-record swing of 28.5 percentage points in Wellingborough and a more modest one of 16.4 points in Kingswood, both of which would give them a secure majority if repeated at a national vote. Rishi Sunak said “Midterm elections are always difficult for incumbent governments, and the circumstances of these elections were of course particularly challenging.”\nSunak has insisted that his government can afford to cut taxes, despite the country having entered a recession, because “economic conditions have improved”. Speaking to the media, he said “our plan is working” and he can “give everyone the peace of mind that there is a better future for them and their families”.\nLabour leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, urged people to vote for the party at the next general election in order to get rid of the Westminster Conservative government. He claimed Scotland would be at the heart of a Labour-led UK government, and criticised the SNP government in Holyrood for what he described as “a culture of secrecy and cover-ups”. \nNatWest made its biggest annual profit last year since the 2007 financial crisis. The UK lender – which is still 35% government-owned – said pre-tax profits rose 20% to £6.2bn in the year to December.\nNo new proposals for general-use windfarms were submitted for planning permission in England last year, despite the government’s much-vaunted relaxation of planning restrictions.\nA charity that has worked for 37 years for greater cohesion between different UK faith communities is expected to close down next week after the government signalled it will scrap its funding. The Inter Faith Network (IFN) is due to close after Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said he was “minded to withdraw” £155,000 of provisional funding over concerns about a trustee connected to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).\nPeople are being hospitalised for sexual health conditions that are easily treatable in local clinics, experts have warned, after some council budgets being cut by up to two-thirds over 10 years.\n\nI wanted to say thank you so much for reading this week and all your comments while I have been sitting in for Andrew Sparrow. I’ve really appreciated them. He will be back with you next week, and I will no doubt see you around the Guardian website somewhere soon. Take care and enjoy the best weekend you can.\n\n\n\n 3.59pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer and former prime minister Gordon Brown were among mourners today at the funeral of veteran Labour MP Tony Lloyd in Stretford.\nGiving an address, Brown said “His mission was social justice, his life was given to public service, his cause was the people he represented. Fighting for Tony was not against any individual or any group, it was against poverty, inequality and injustice wherever he saw it.”\nOthers at the service included Andy Burnham, Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper, Lisa Nandy, Lucy Powell and Rebecca Long-Bailey. Conservative MP for Ribble Valley Nigel Evans also attended.\nRayner said “Tony was not just a politician. He was guided by a deep sense of duty and commitment to improving society in pursuit of his socialist principles. He never lost sight of his values and he also showed incredible skill in bridging divides, uniting people and trying to find common ground while making progress. He devoted himself to championing the marginalised, the silent and the forgotten.”\nLloyd died from blood cancer last month aged 73.\nJosh Halliday has a report here: Tributes paid to ‘true statesman’ Tony Lloyd at Manchester service\n\n Related: Tributes paid to ‘true statesman’ Tony Lloyd at Manchester service \n\n\nUpdated at 4.00pm GMT\n\n\n 3.36pm GMT \n\nSky News is reporting that Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger, who are co-chairs of one of the groupings of Tory backbenchers, have issued a statement saying Rishi Sunak must “change course” after the two byelection defeats on Thursday. It reads:\n\nThe results in yesterday’s byelections are unequivocal: Labour are winning because many of the people who backed us in 2019 are staying at home or voting Reform. Voters are not flocking to Labour. \nThey want a genuine alternative to the consensus politics of the last two decades – high taxes, low security, managed decline.\nThe government has made some positive steps to win back our lost voters. But all of this is plainly not enough. In 2019 the British people voted for change, and they haven’t seen it yet. \nWe have many good excuses – the disruptions and distractions of Brexit, Covid and the Ukraine war – but so far, we have not delivered on the promises we made at the last election. There is still time – but our party must change course.\n\nThe pair are part of “The New Conservatives” grouping, which – assuming you don’t have perfect recall of the seemingly myriad factions in the parliamentary party these days – my colleague Ben Quinn helpfully wrote about December. He said:\n\nThe New Conservatives are the newest and one of the most vocal groupings, created in May 2023 and include Lee Anderson, as well as Tories gaining more prominence such as Miriam Cates. Many are in marginal “red wall” seats.\nIts MPs, who are thought to number about 25, are predominantly from the party’s 2019 intake. The group’s co-chair Danny Kruger has pressed the PM to deliver the Rwanda deportation plan by “unpicking” Britain from a range of international obligations.\n\n\n\n\n 3.28pm GMT \n\n“That’s what change means, that’s why change matters” has been a recurring refrain during Anas Sarwar’s speech to Scottish Labour, and he has finished his speech with a plea for people to vote Labour in Scotland to get rid of the Conservative government in Westminster.\nHe told delegates: “Our opponents don’t want change. They are the parties of the status quo – Scottish Labour is now the only party of change.”\nMusic nerds klaxon: Sia’s Unstoppable has been the opening and closing music for the speech. It’s a bop.\n\n\n\n 3.10pm GMT \n\nOn energy policy, Anas Sarwar has said:\n\nLet me be clear, oil and gas will play a role in the energy mix for decades to come – we will not turn off the taps – but we will also accelerate the transition to net zero.\nWe will upgrade the UK energy grid, invest in Scotland’s ports, capitalise on new technologies, and use Labour’s “British jobs bonus” to create quality supply chain jobs right here in Scotland.\nWe will make our country the winner in the race for the next generation of clean energy jobs and cheaper energy bills – not sell off our seabed on the cheap.\n\n\n\n\n 3.06pm GMT \n\nAnas Sarwar, the Labour leader in Scotland, says that the devolved government in Scotland has for twenty-five years mostly been a social policy government rather than an economic policy government. He describes the SNP as an “anti-business” party, and the Green party as “anti-growth”.\n\n\n\n 2.58pm GMT \n\nAnas Sarwar says that a Labour government for the UK would deliver “a race to the top” rather than a “race to the bottom”, and “the most transformative change in conditions for working people for a generation.”\nHe criticises the SNP for not making the best of devolution, saying:\n\nA quarter of a century on from when our party created the Scottish parliament, our opponents have failed to make devolution work for the people of Scotland\nDevolution was never meant to be about two governments fighting with each other. Devolution was always meant to be about Scottish solutions to Scottish problems. And two governments working together when in our national interest to actually deliver for Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n 2.52pm GMT \n\nScottish Labour will be “responsible” with public money if elected to be the Scottish government in 2026, Anas Sarwar said.\nHe told Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow:\n\nThe SNP is being reckless with your money, and Scots shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for their incompetence. Because people work hard, pay their taxes, and expect government to be responsible with their money – it shouldn’t be too much to ask.\nWe will end the culture of financial mismanagement, we will end the secrecy, and we will open the books to public scrutiny, to restore people’s trust in our politics. We will be responsible with every penny of public money – that’s what change means and that’s why change matters.\n\nTurning his attention back to the Conservatives and London, Sarwar said “I don’t support independence. And I don’t support a referendum. But I understand why people want to run a million miles from a Tory government”\nHe implored people to go “on this part of the journey” together to end the Conservative government in Westminster as the first step.\n\n\n\n 2.48pm GMT \n\nAnas Sarwar, the Labour leader in Scotland, has attacked the Conservative government in London for being in thrall to a “right-wing crankfest” and culture wars, and promised that a Labour government would end corruption and get back money lost during the pandemic and through cronyism.\nHe said:\n\nThe Tories are so mired in scandal and division and chaos, that their MPs are too busy trying to find a way to save their own skin rather than focusing on the huge challenges facing our country.\nAnd while they seek to divide communities from each other, they also seek to divide us between haves and have-nots. They have crashed the economy – and put the UK into recession.\nImagine five more years of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel, Lee Anderson, Liz Truss, Suella Braverman and Rishi Sunak. What an unbearable nightmare.\n\nHe has also been highly critical of the SNP, saying a culture of cover-up and secrecy has enveloped the Scottish government. He said that by voting Scottish Labour, Scotland would be at the heart of the next UK government.\n\n\n\n 2.38pm GMT \n\nAnas Sarwar has said statehood for Palestine is “not the gift of a neighbour”.\nHere are the quotes from slightly earlier in the speech with have just appeared on PA:\n\nThe loss of innocent life in Israel and in Gaza is an absolute travesty.\nOn 7 October, we saw the largest loss of Jewish life in any single day since the Holocaust – it was unimaginable, unforgivable, and unjustifiable.\nAnd we were right to show our solidarity with the Jewish people, and with the people of Israel in the face of that terror.\nAnd as I have been clear, the collective punishment of 2.2 million innocent citizens of Gaza is not – never can be – a justifiable response to the horror inflicted by Hamas.\n\n\n\n\n 2.36pm GMT \n\nDescribing himself as a “proud son of Glasgow”, Anas Sarwar, the Labour leader in Scotland has introduced his children, and said he is proud to be bringing up his children there. He has criticised the Scottish government for concentrating too much power in Holyrood.\nHe says that two years ago conference paid tribute to those in Ukraine, and says they do again. He says they also show solidarity with the people of Israel after the 7 October attack which he described as “unforgiveable”, going on to say the collective punishment of 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip cannot be the right response. He says “the fighting must stop now”, calling for the end of fire going into and out of Gaza, the release of all hostages, the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for world leaders to work on an enduring path to a two state solution.\nSarwar says a collective failure of the international community to strive for peace has led to this situation because only when there is a safe and secure Israel side-by-side with a safe and secure Palestinian state will there be peace.\nHe says that people must separate Hamas from the Palestinian people, and separate the Israeli people from the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, and that the peaceful aspirations of the people of both Israel and Palestine are being poorly served by bad faith actors.\nHe says there must be a zero tolerance for antisemitism and a zero tolerance for Islamophobia, and that the Labour party will always stand shoulder-to-shoulder with both communities.\n\n\n\n 2.25pm GMT \n\nAnas Sarwar, the Labour leader in Scotland is opening his Scottish Labour conference speech by saying Scottish Labour is “back on the pitch and winning again” after the year they’ve had since their last conference.\nSarwar has described this year’s vote as “the most important general election for a generation”. He appealed to activists to remember the goosebumps they felt when Michael Shanks was elected, and talks of watching Labour MP after Labour MP being elected and the electoral map turning red and a Labour prime minister being elected.\n“That’s the change we are fighting for, and the change our country so desperately needs,” he said.\n\n\n\n 2.14pm GMT \n\nRutherglen and Hamilton West MP Michael Shanks is warming up for Anas Sarwar at the moment in Glasgow at the Scottish Labour conference. He is telling conference it is great that “Labour gain” is back in their vocabulary in Scotland, has made jibes at the SNP’s leadership election and iPad expenses scandal, and joked about Ian Murray, Labour’s only other MP in Scotland, having to now share his office in Westminster after Shanks was elected in October last year.\n\n\n\n 2.01pm GMT \n\nLabour’s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, is about to address the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow. You can watch it here.\n\n\n\n 1.21pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer said the results from the Kingswood and Wellingborough byelections – where two Labour parliamentary candidates took seats from the Conservatives – show people want change.\nOn X, next to a clip from his BBC Breakfast appearance this morning, he said:\n\nThe message from Kingswood and Wellingborough is clear – people are crying out for change.\nAs we approach a general election, Labour will work to earn every vote, so we can deliver this change across the country.\n\n\n\nThe message from Kingswood and Wellingborough is clear - people are crying out for change.

They have failed to deliver. We will deliver on that promise.”\nMiliband said “We’re going to have GB Energy, a publicly owned energy company, headquartered here in Scotland investing billions of pounds. We’re going to have a British jobs bonus. We want to end the grotesque situation where we have massive offshore windfarms off the coast of Scotland but not a piece of them is built here in Scotland. We are going to change that.\n“We will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the industries that will power our future – hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, floating offshore wind. These are the technologies. We are going to succeed where the SNP and the Tories have failed.”\n\n\n\n 12.29pm GMT \n\nPolly Toynbee has her column today on the byelection results, arguing that the voters of Wellingborough and Kingswood said one thing with one voice: the Tory era is over.\n\n Related: The voters of Wellingborough and Kingswood said one thing with one voice: the Tory era is over | Polly Toynbee \n\n\n\n\n 12.17pm GMT \n\nHere is a video clip of Rishi Sunak delivering his verdict on the byelection results in Wellingborough and Kingswood.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.57am GMT \n\nHere is what prime minister Rishi Sunak had to say specifically about the byelection defeats in Wellingborough and Kingswood:\n\nMidterm elections are always difficult for incumbent governments, and the circumstances of these elections were of course particularly challenging.\nNow, I think if you look at the results, very low turnout, and it shows that we’ve got work to do to show people that we are delivering on their priorities and that’s what I’m absolutely determined to do, but also shows that there isn’t a huge amount of enthusiasm for the alternative in Keir Starmer and the Labour party, and that’s because they don’t have a plan.\nAnd if you don’t have a plan, you can’t deliver real change. And when the general election comes, that’s the message I’ll be making to the country. Stick with our plan, because it is starting to deliver the change that the country wants and needs.\n\nSunak refers to the byelections as midterm, although they come right at the end of the current five year parliament, with a general election set to take place within months.\n\n\n\n 11.44am GMT \n\nDavid Frost has posted to social media to say that he believes it is not too late for the Conservatives to change course and still win the next election. The peer said:\n\nI will have more to say in Telegraph later, but in brief these byelections show the same story as previous ones: former Conservative voters are simply not coming out and voting Conservative. The Labour vote isn’t going up, but ours is collapsing. To get voters back we need a shift to more conservative policy, on tax and spend, immigration, net zero, public sector reform, and more. It’s late, but not – yet – too late.\n\n\n\nI will have more to say in @Telegraph later, but in brief these by-elections show the same story as previous ones: former Conservative voters are simply not coming out and voting Conservative.

As well as commenting about his party’s two byelection defeats [See 9.49 GMT], the prime minister has been speaking to the media about knife crime and policing policy.\nHe was shown a series of more than half a dozen blades that had been confiscated by officers, and spoke about plans to increase patrols in areas affected by antisocial behaviour.\nSunak said:\n\nI’ve been here in Essex talking to the police about that plan and how it’s working, and the good news is that it is working and making a real difference.\nThrough the increased use of hotspot policing, drug testing on arrest, dispersal powers, on-the-spot fines, we’ve seen antisocial behaviour fall by up to 50% in the areas where we’ve trialled this new plan.\nThat’s why we’re now going to roll it out across the country with more funding so that everyone can benefit from these improvements and it just shows that if we stick to the plan we can deliver a brighter future for everyone.\n\nYesterday, home secretary James Cleverly posted to social media about plans to role out what the government calls “hotspot policing”.\n\n\nOur pilot of hotspot policing has more officers out on the beat to drive down antisocial behaviour. From April, we’re rolling it out to every police force in England and Wales. That means up to 900,000 extra hours of targeted patrols in communities up and down the country. pic.twitter.com/Tp2M9cEZ57— James Cleverly🇬🇧 (@JamesCleverly) February 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.15am GMT \n\nKeir Starmer said that he had made a tough decision to drop the party’s support for Azhar Ali in the Rochdale byelection, but he was “satisfied” with Labour’s “robust due process”.\nHe told BBC Breakfast earlier:\n\nI did something that no leader of the Labour party has ever done before, which is to remove a candidate in a byelection where they cannot be replaced, because I was so determined to take decisive action in relation to antisemitism.\nIt was done within days. We are giving up a Labour seat. That’s the right thing to do. But what it shows is, when there’s tough decisions to be made I take those decisions.\nI’ve put in place in the Labour party a robust due process exercised for every single candidate. We must continue to fight antisemitism wherever we are in organisations, in political parties.\n\n\n\n\n 10.36am GMT \n\nRichard Tice, fresh from Reform UK’s best ever byelection performances, has been on GB News arguing that the prime minister and the Conservative party should “step aside” and let him and his party challenge Labour at the next election.\nHe told the broadcaster:\n\nI think people are realising the Tories are tired, that they are old and they are toxic. They’ve had the chance - they’ve blown it, frankly, they should stand aside now having messed up. My message to them is let me take on Keir Starmer and beat him. You’ve got to be optimistic. I’ve got loads of it.\n\nHe added that there was no chance that Reform UK would step aside from contesting Conservative seats, as forerunner the Brexit party did in 2019.\n\nNo way. [The Conservative party] had a chance before. No one believes a word they say anymore. They said that last time and we fell for it. We’re not falling for that nonsense again. No one trusts them. I’ve still got the scars on my back from last time. A week tomorrow we will be releasing the draft of our election contract with the people which will cover all of these areas in great detail, including costings.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.46am GMT\n\n\n 10.31am GMT \n\nYesterday I mentioned that the Conservatives had taken a four second clip of London mayor Sadiq Khan misspeaking during an interview and used it on social media to imply he had said that the Labour party was “proud to be both anti racist, but also antisemitic”.\nThe social media post was widely criticised for being misleading, as the Conservatives had edited out Khan immediately correcting himself to say he was proud of the way the party was tackling antisemitism.\nThey accompanied the four second clip with the caption “Sadiq Khan says the quiet part out loud”. Miriam Mirwitch, who is national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement, condemned it as “cynical political point scoring [that] will only hurt British Jews like me.”\nThis morning Calum Macdonald tried to challenge Tory chair Richard Holden about it when he appeared on Times Radio. Holden absolutely refused to engage with the argument that the party was spreading misinformation, instead saying it wasn’t the main issue, and arguing about the semantics of whether the video was “edited” or “clipped”. \nThe exchange is excruciating – you can watch it here:\n\n\n“It's not been edited. It was clipped.”Chair of the Conservative Party Richard Holden defends the use of a “clipped” video of Sadiq Khan on the party’s social media.@CalumAM | @RicHolden | #TimesRadio pic.twitter.com/QKS2iQVjHX— Times Radio (@TimesRadio) February 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.19am GMT \nSunak: we can afford to cut taxes during a recession\n\nRishi Sunak has insisted that his government can afford to cut taxes, despite the country having entered a recession, because “economic conditions have improved”.\nSpeaking to the media, he said “our plan is working” and he can “give everyone the peace of mind that there is a better future for them and their families”.\nHe said tax cuts were possible “because of our plan to halve inflation, which has been successful over the past year, and because economic conditions have improved. We have already been able to start cutting taxes for people.”\nHe continued:\n\nWe delivered a significant tax cut at the start of this year, cutting the rate of national insurance from 12% to 10%, now that means someone on an average earnings of about £35,000 is seeing a tax cut worth £450 that hit their payslips in January.\nNow that will benefit everyone in work, it demonstrates that our plan is working. And if we stick with that plan, I can give everyone the piece of mind that there is a better future for them and their families ahead, and we can all have a renewed sense of pride in the country.\n\nSunak is in Harlow today, where he has been meeting the local police force.\nHe told the media that he was making progress on his five key pledges. He said:\n\nWe’ve clearly been through a lot over the past couple of years as a country, but I genuinely believe at the start of this year we’re pointing in the right direction.\nNow we’re not out of the woods yet, but across all the priorities that I set out we’re making progress.\nInflation has been more than halved, the economy out-performed expectations last year, debt is on track to fall, we’ve cut the number of illegal migrants coming by a third and we’re making progress on the longest waits in the NHS.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.43am GMT\n\n\n 10.00am GMT \nStarmer: Labour are 'credible contenders' for next election, but 'that is all'\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said that his party has achieved a decade’s worth of work turning the party around after the last election result to become “credible contenders” at the next one, but added “that is all we are.”\nHe told BBC Breakfast:\n\nI’m proud of the work I’ve done as leader. The progress we’ve now made from the worst results since 1935 to being now credible contenders – and that is all we are – for the 2024 election.\nI have to say, when I took over as leader most people shook my hand and said: “Good luck Keir,” and in the next breath they said: “You will never do this in one five-year parliamentary term.”\nWe are trying to do, if you like, what Kinnock, what Smith and Blair did, over 13 or 14 years, in four short years.”\n\n\n\n\n 9.49am GMT \nSunak: a vote for anyone other than Conservatives at general election 'is just a vote to put Keir Starmer in power'\n\nRishi Sunak has said the next general election is a choice between himself and Keir Starmer as prime minister, and that a vote for any party other than the Conservatives was a vote to put Starmer in power.\nHe told reporters:\n\nA vote for anyone who isn’t the Conservative candidate, whether that’s Reform or anyone else, is just a vote to put Keir Starmer in power.\nThat’s the actual choice at the general election, between me and him, between the Conservatives and Labour.\nNow I believe our plan is working. At the start of this year we’re heading in the right direction, taxes are coming down, inflation is falling, and if we stick with that plan we can deliver everyone a brighter future.\n\nThis week the UK went into recession.\n\n\n\n 9.31am GMT \n\nSteven Morris is in Kingswood for the Guardian\nInteresting comments from the Labour MP Chris Bryant who led the campaign in Kingswood and has been celebrating in the park with the successful candidate. He told the Guardian the sense of relief at the win was “massive”.\n“At 6pm yesterday evening, I thought, oh, no we’ve lost it. It had been tipping with rain. Would voters turn out? At the beginning of this campaign everyone was saying, Labour’s bound to win this. I never thought that – so yes, massive sense of relief, massive achievement.”\nHe said it was a boost to Labour’s chances of winning in the south and south-west of England. “This shows we’re on track. A lot of people think it’s time for a change and that is replicable across lots of constituencies.”\nBryant also pointed out that a chunk of the Kingswood constituency (which is abolished at the next general election) goes into Jacob Rees-Mogg’s.\nRees-Mogg’s response to the result has been to say that the combined Tory and Reform UK vote was larger than the Labour one. “But that’s not how it works. How patronising can you be to voters? You just go, they’re really ours, they’re not. He lost badly and I got the feeling this was very much his campaign.”\nBryant also criticised the Tories’s campaign for being “just rude” about the Labour candidate, Damien Egan, continually claiming he wasn’t local, though he was raised in Kingswood.\nHe took a swipe at the Tory candidate, Sam Bromiley, for his swift exit from the count hall.\n“The Tory party used to be the party of manners. It is rude to the voters just to run away at the end, not even make a little speech of concession. They all need to go back to finishing school.”\nBryant said Labour’s troubles over comments made about Israel this week weren’t mentioned on the doorstep, though the U-turn on green energy did surface. “If anything people were saying fair play to the Labour party, they are telling it like it is and being upfront before the election.” \n\n\n\n 9.28am GMT \n\nA lot of chatter about low turnout is around, so I thought I would just go back and look at the turnout figures at byelections for the last couple of years. You can see there are a few outliers there, and every constituency had its own circumstances around the vote, but here is a list if you find it helpful to put the Wellingborough and Kingswood figures into some context.\n\nSouthend West, Feb 2022, 24.0%\nBirmingham Erdington, Mar 2022, 27.0%\nWakefield, Jun 2022, 39.1%\nTiverton and Honiton, Jun 2022, 52.3%\nCity of Chester, Dec 2022, 41.2%\nStretford and Urmston, Dec 2022, 25.8%\nWest Lancashire, Feb 2023, 31.4%\nUxbridge and South Ruislip, Jul 2023, 46.2%\nSelby and Ainsty, Jul 2023, 44.8%\nSomerton and Frome, Jul 2023, 44.2%\nRutherglen and Hamilton West, Oct 2023, 37.2%\nMid Bedfordshire, Oct 2023, 44%\nTamworth, Oct 2023, 35.9%\nWellingborough, Feb 2024, 38%\nKingswood, Feb 2024, 37.1%\n\n\n\n\n 9.19am GMT \n\nConservative chair Richard Holden has cautioned against extrapolating byelection results to a general election, telling listeners of BBC Radio 4 that “People know in a byelection they’re not voting to change the Government, so I think to extrapolate from that to a general election isn’t quite right.”\nHe’ll be absolutely furious if he ever finds out what David Cameron was saying when the Conservatives won Norwich North in 2009 …\n\n\n\n 9.08am GMT \n\nSteven Morris is in Kingswood for the Guardian\nLabour activists have been in a damp Kingswood park to celebrate their byelection win in South Gloucestershire. Pleasingly – and by sheer coincidence - the spot on the mapping system What3words is “reason anyway vote”.\nPat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, said the results in Kingswood and Wellingborough had been “fantastic” and were a “mark of the progress we have made in recent years and stand testament to the desire of voters to see change.”\nMcFadden said he hoped the Tories would act courageously and call a general election. He said that Keir Starmer had acted “decisively” when he suspended Azhar Ali and contrasted this with “long drawn out Tory scandals” involving Peter Bone and Owen Paterson.\nThe new Kingswood MP, Damien Egan, said:\n\nThe issues people talked about time and time again was the NHS – nowhere in Kingswood can you get an NHS dentist, how hard it is to find a doctor, the cost of living crisis, which is so much more than a slogan – mortgages up by £400 a month, people having to worry about what they put in their trolley, keeping their house warm in winter, families cancelling holidays. Safety on our streets – people want to see police back in our community. The hard work starts now.\n\n\n\n\n 9.03am GMT \nStarmer: Labour must fight like they are five points behind in the polls\n\nKeir Starmer says he has told his team that the Labour party must fight for the next general election “like we are five points behind”.\nAppearing on BBC Breakfast and asked if he took the Wellingborough and Kingswood victories as a personal endorsement of his leadership, he said “I don’t tend to personalise it. I’m very proud of that result. I’m proud of the work that I’ve done as leader. I’ve changed the Labour Party, and we brought in a very good result last night. I don’t want to get into the warm bath of saying: ‘Job done.’”\nThe Labour leader then said he had told his team to “fight like we’re five points behind”.\nHe told BBC Breakfast:\n\nI think the country is crying out for change. Everybody knows that. Things aren’t working. Their NHS isn’t working. They’ve got a cost of living crisis. I think they’ve concluded that the Tories have failed after 14 years.\nThey can see now the Labour party has changed. It’s a different party to the party in 2019. And they can see that we’ve got the answers to their problems, and I was very pleased last night to see that we were clearly getting Tory switchers, in other words, people who hadn’t voted for the Labour party before coming out last night and voting for the Labour party.\n\nHe added: “But I would say this particularly to my team, there is more work to do. There is always more work to do.”\n\n\n\n 8.47am GMT \nLabour's Pat McFadden praises 'fantastic results' but says 'real test is to come later this year'\n\nPat McFadden, Labour campaign manager, has said that the byelection results in Wellingborough and Kingswood were “fantastic results” but that “the real test is to come later this year”.\nSpeaking from Kingswood, he told viewers of Sky News:\n\nWe had a fantastic result last night, overturning a Tory majority of around 11,000 and in Wellingborough an even bigger victory overturning a majority of 18,000. These results are a mark of the progress that the Labour party has made in recent years under Keir Starmer’s leadership. We are back on the pitch in a credible way. So they were fantastic results. But of course, we also know the real test is to come later this year and the general election.\n\nHe said Labour’s chance to show what it would do in power “can only come when the prime minister stops sitting in Number 10, waiting for something to turn up, and actually calls the general election that will give people the choice over the country’s future.”\nHe said that people didn’t need statistics to see that the country was in a poor state. He said “people can see it in terms of the cost of living. They can see it in terms of public services. And they can see it in terms of the difficulty of paying the bills.”\nPressed on what Labour would do differently with the economy, he said:\n\nFirst of all financial stability: no repeat of that disastrous Tory mini-budget that crashed the economy and put everybody’s mortgages up.\nSecondly, change the planning laws to get the economy moving again, making it easier for people to invest in the UK and get Britain building again.\nThirdly, make a success of the green transition. We’re going to set up GB energy, and have a national investment fund to really drive forward this green transition that will give us more energy security and in the long term, reduce people’s bills.\nThese are the kinds of things that we need to do to get the economy moving again, because without getting economic growth, it is really difficult for people’s living standards to increase. We know the Tories have failed on that. \n\n\n\n\n 8.26am GMT \n\nHere is my colleague Mark Sweney on the news that retail sales in Great Britain rebounded strongly after their Christmas slump.\n\n Related: Retail sales in Great Britain rebound strongly after Christmas slump \n\n\n\n\n 8.21am GMT \n\nIt isn’t just all byelection news this morning – the Telegraph reported overnight that Jeremy Hunt has shelved plans for a 2p cut to income tax at next month’s Budget.\nIt cited a Treasury source saying that after the UK fell into recession this week: “The world has changed. Everything you thought was going to happen [at the Budget] may not now happen.”\nThe paper writes Hunt had considered “reducing National Insurance employee contributions by two percentage points as an alternative”, but:\n\nNew forecasts showing the high costs of servicing government debt mean that Mr Hunt has less money to spend than expected. The Telegraph understands he has therefore deemed both moves unaffordable for now.\n\n\n\n\n 8.16am GMT \n\nPolitical correspondent Kiran Stacey offers this analysis this morning:\nIf Kingswood is more representative of national opinion, it suggests the Labour lead is softening slightly after three byelections last year where the swing was more than 20% on each occasion.\nRecent polls suggest the party has dropped in the polls since Starmer’s decision to scrap his £28bn-a-year green spending plans – though none have been conducted since Thursday’s announcement that the country entered a recession at the end of last year.\nThe Tories tried to put a gloss on the defeats on Friday, highlighting the low turnout in both seats.\nJust 37% of voters turned out in Kingswood, and 38% in Wellingborough – below the mid-40s seen in recent byelections in Mid Bedfordshire, Somerton and Frome, and Selby and Ainsty. In both seats, the increase in Labour support was just half the drop in the Conservatives’ vote, suggesting that the opposition party is not fully capitalising on the government’s unpopularity.\nIf the Conservatives can persuade their voters to come out at a general election, party officials have said, they can still keep hold of power.\nRead more of Kiran Stacey’s analysis here: Labour can celebrate byelection victories, but low turnout could indicate larger threat\n\n Related: Labour can celebrate byelection victories, but low turnout could indicate larger threat \n\n\n\n\n 8.11am GMT \nTory chair: Reform UK 'want to see Keir Starmer in Downing Street'\n\nEarlier Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to strike a conciliatory tone with people who voted for Reform UK in these byelections, saying the night had been a good one for what he termed the Conservative family of voters. He suggested that the way to bring them back into the fold was “lower taxation, taking more of the advantages of Brexit, with more of the removal of EU retained law” and “doing less on the green issue that is making people cold and poor, and helping revitalise our economy.”\nTory chair Richard Holden has taken a rather different approach this morning, telling BBC Breakfast:\n\nTheir ambition is to block Conservatives winning seats and therefore put Keir Starmer into Downing Street. They’ve made it very clear, you’ve read out that statement from them, that’s what Reform UK want to do, they want to see Keir Starmer in Downing Street and not have a Conservative government.\nReform aren’t challenging realistically for seats. This general elections is going to be a battle between the Conservatives and the Labour party. All Reform are going to do, as they’ve said themselves, is help put Keir Starmer and Labour into Downing Street.”\nIf the right of the British politics and the centre and centre-right – that broad church which is the Conservative Party – doesn’t unite, then we will see a Labour victory.\nI believe we have every opportunity to win the next general election, I think we definitely can do it, but that means we have got to come together as a party, unite in the best interests of the country, deliver those things that we’ve promised, work together as a party to do that.\n\n\n\n\n 7.52am GMT \n\nPA Media are carrying a few more words from Gen Kitchen, who is the new Labour MP for Wellingborough after her victory in the seat which disgraced former MP Peter Bone had held since 2005. She said:\n\nThis shows that people are fed up, they want change, they want competency, they want pragmatism and they want politicians to under-promise and over-deliver, which is what I am hoping to do.\nIt shows how much hard work we put in and the real positive message we were putting out. There is a real appetite for a fresh start and change.\nThere’s a lot of try before you buy, a lot of people lending their votes. I have to make sure they buy again, so I will be out door-knocking, campaigning and delivering on our pledges.\nI will be working incredibly hard to secure their votes whenever the general election comes. And I will be working really hard on our casework that we have picked up on at the doors.\nWe have had so many people say they haven’t had a politician knock on their doors in the last 20 years. It means we have to make sure we deliver on the promises we have made.\n\n\n\n\n 7.43am GMT \n\nKeir Starmer has reiterated his message that yesterday’s byelection results show people want change, posting to social media to say:\n\nThe Kingswood and Wellingborough results show that people want change and are ready to put their faith in a changed Labour party to deliver it. The Tories have failed, Rishi’s recession proves that. Labour is back in the service of working people.\n\n\n\nThe Kingswood and Wellingborough results show that people want change and are ready to put their faith in a changed Labour Party to deliver it.The Tories have failed, Rishi's recession proves that.

The ONS says that retail sales jumped by 3.4% last month. It was the largest monthly rise in close to three years, and offset a record 3.3% fall in December, bringing volumes back to November levels. The numbers will bring a touch of cheer for Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, who both this week claimed the economy was heading in the right direction despite official figures showing the UK had entered a recession.\n\n\n\n 7.38am GMT \n\nThe chair of the Conservative party has said that voters concerns on the doorstep during the campaign were about the cost of living crisis. He said he wanted to see inflation fall further, and for the Bank of England to cut interest rates soon after that. \nAsked about the performance of the Reform UK party, which secured its best performance at a byelection in this parliament and since it rebranded from the Brexit party in 2021, Richard Holden said they had not scaled the heights that Ukip did in the 2010s.\nHe told Sky News:\n\nI remember those byelections back in the mid 2010s, where we saw the predecessor’s predecessor to Reform UK, Ukip, get 45% for 50% of the vote in some cases, in Clacton and Rochester and Strood back in the day, so we’re not in that sort of circumstances at the moment.\n\nSitting MP Douglas Carswell took 59.7% of the vote for Ukip in the October 2014 Clacton byelection after he switched from Conservatives to the party. A month later Mark Reckless took 42.1% of the vote in Rochester and Strood for Ukip under similar circumstances.\nHolden said the Tories needed to appeal to voters more broadly, and needed an upturn in economic news, saying:\n\nIt’s very important that we have to appeal to voters from right across the piece. The turnout was very much down, and it’s very clear that that turnout was down particularly amongst people who voted Conservative\nIt’s really up to us to take the message out to them, to show that clarity of our plan for the future. We’ve got inflation are falling now, but we’ve got to do more, and really highlight why people should be voting Conservative when it comes to the general.\nWhen I spoke to people who were voting for different parties on the doorstep [their concerns] were very similar in a lot of them, based around the cost of living, worried about that. They want to see further falls in inflation. The Bank of England is predicting that inflation will be falling within the year. I want to see interest rates cuts following that.\n\n\n\n\n 7.27am GMT \n\nRichard Holden has told Sky News that the night was “disappointing” for the Conservatives. The chair of the party stressed the low turnout yesterday, and the individual circumstances of each byelection with one of their MPs being forced to stand down after a recall petition, and another MP resigning over the government’s environmental policy.\nSaying there was no need to shy away from how bad the results were for the party, he told viewers:\n\nI think one of the most disappointing things for me was the turnout in the elections was so significantly down compared to the previous general elections in both seats, and I want to see people actively positive participating democracy. I think we’ve got to look at these both these by elections and the context in which they happened as well. \n\n\n\n\n 7.21am GMT \n\nThe Kingswood and Wellingborough byelections are the topic of our First Edition newsletter today, with Archie Bland speaking to Kiran Stacey and Sammy Gecsoyler. Here is an excerpt:\nThis morning’s results will feel like relief from a rough spell for Keir Starmer. Are they more than that? “It depends on where you look,” Kiran Stacey told me. “Wellingborough is right up there as a byelection result. But it’s a bit of an anomaly because of the circumstances there. In Kingswood, the swing is plenty for an overall majority, but it’s considerably less than the last three byelections. That tells us there’s a slight softening in Labour’s lead.”\nOn a low turnout, Gen Kitchen got 13,844 votes against 7,408 for Helen Harrison. “It’s a massive result for Labour, considering the week they’ve had,” said Sammy Gecsoyler, who was covering the count. “It does suggest that in seats like this, their chances haven’t been hampered significantly.”\nEven at the count, Sammy said, “the Tories were pretty absent – you couldn’t really see them”. Bone didn’t show up himself. The only Tory MP there, Amanda Milling, declined interviews on the fairly flimsy basis that she was a government whip.\nIf all of that coupled with the dismal national picture added up to a rough night for the Tories, there was more bad news in the shape of 13% of the vote for the Reform UK candidate, Ben Habib – its best result yet and more than half the Tory vote count. “Richard Tice [Reform’s leader] was there to capitalise on it,” Sammy said. “They were very happy. Habib called it a stepping stone for the party.”\nRead more here: Friday briefing – Labour hand the Tories two painful byelection defeats\n\n Related: Friday briefing: Labour hand the Tories two painful byelection defeats \n\n\nSign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition\n\n\n\n\n 7.03am GMT \n\nVeteran Labour MP Chris Bryant said the result in Kingswood was partly down to a lot of voters going directly from Conservative to Labour.\nSpeaking from the Kingswood count, Bryant said, “one man said to me today he was 65 and had voted Conservative all his life, including during the Tony Blair years, and today was the first time he voted Labour.”\nAsked what the two byelection results meant for the Labour party, he said: “Keir Starmer is a winner. I think I am right in saying that if Keir Starmer wins both byelections tonight, he will be the most successful Labour leader in byelections in our history.\n“For Jacob Rees-Mogg this is a bit of problem because 50% of this seat goes into his seat,” he said.\n\nIf I were him, I wouldn’t be happy. They also ran a very nasty, negative campaign. We ran a campaign based on Damien’s plan and what he wanted to get done for Kingswood and what he wanted to campaign for. Undoubtedly the biggest thing of all is the Rishi recession because you didn’t need to have it announced on the news – people felt it in their pocket.”\n\n\n\n\n 6.50am GMT \n\nSpeaking from the Kingswood election count, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg congratulated Damien Egan on winning.\n“Does it tell you anything about the general election? Almost certainly not,” he said.\n“Byelections are an opportunity for people not to turn out, to protest, and at ensuing general elections they don’t give a consistent guide to what happens.”\nThe MP for North East Somerset said: “From the point of view of Kingswood, I think the Conservatives can be more pleased than they might have expected. I certainly thought this result would be worse.”\nRees-Mogg said the Conservative party needed to “learn from the result”.\n\nConservative party votes are most likely to come from people who stay at home or who voted Reform. How do we win them back to the Tory family … By delivering things they believe in and that means lower taxation, taking more of the advantages of Brexit, with more of the removal of EU retained law, it means doing less on the green issue that is making people cold and poor, and helping revitalise our economy.”\n\n\nUpdated at 6.51am GMT\n\n\n 6.37am GMT \nThe public 'want change', says Keir Starmer\n\nSpeaking after the Wellingborough result was announced, Labour leader Keir Starmer said “by winning in these Tory strongholds, we can confidently say that Labour is back in the service of working people and we will work tirelessly to deliver for them.”\nHe said the byelection results show the public “want change”.\n“Those who gave us their trust in Kingswood and Wellingborough, and those considering doing so, can be safe in the knowledge that we will spend every day working to get Britain’s future back.”\nBoth wins will temper fears that a testing week for Labour has significantly threatened its electoral prospects and will further bolster predictions that the party stands to win a large majority at the next general election.\n\nUpdated at 6.51am GMT\n\n\n 6.20am GMT \n\nLabour’s wins in Kingswood and Wellingborough mean the Conservatives have now lost 10 byelections in the course of this parliament – two more than the eight defeats suffered by the 1992-97 Conservative administration led by John Major.\nIt means the Conservative government has lost more byelections than any previous government since the 1966-70 Labour administration of Harold Wilson, which endured 15 losses.\nThe size of the majority Labour overturned at Wellingborough – 18,540 – is the third biggest Tory majority the party has overturned at a byelection since the war, behind those in Mid Bedfordshire in October 2023 (24,664) and Selby & Ainsty in July 2023 (20,137).\n\n\n\n 6.06am GMT \n\nHere’s a selection of images from the evening’s votes.\n\nUpdated at 7.42am GMT\n\n\n 5.53am GMT \nWellingborough win is second largest postwar byelection swing from Tory to Labour\n\nLabour won Wellingborough from the Conservatives on a swing in the share of the vote of 28.5 percentage points.

That is the biggest ever drop that the Conservatives have suffered in a post-war by-election in a seat that they were trying to defend.”\n\n\n\n 5.41am GMT \nReform UK secures strongest byelection results in this parliament\n\nBen Habib, the deputy co-leader of the Reform UK party has secured 13% of the vote in the Wellingborough byelection, marking the party’s best performance at a byelection in this parliament and since it rebranded from the Brexit party in 2021.\nHabib had said he hoped to emulate the party’s national polling level, which has been hovering around the 10% mark in recent months.\nStanding on an anti-net zero platform, the former London MEP for the Brexit party had said he had been encouraged by people waving and tooting support at him while he campaigned on the party’s battle bus around the constituency.\nWhile winning the constituency was seen as a two-horse race between the incumbent Tories and Labour’s Gen Kitchen, a key subtext of the campaign had been the extent to which disillusioned Conservative voters might defect to a party further to the right.\nIn Kingswood, Reform candidate Rupert Lowe finished in third place with 10% of the vote, marking the party’s second-best performance in a byelection in this parliament, behind Wellingborough.\nTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told reporters that if you add together the Reform UK and Conservative vote in Kingswood it is more than Labour’s. “If we can reunite the right in politics there’s a real opportunity for us,” he said.\nRees-Mogg also highlighted the poor turnout of 37.1%. “If you’re a Tory and you stay at home, Rishi Sunak will still be prime minister in the morning,” he said. “I certainly thought this result would be worse. Bear in mind a lot of the postal votes would have been back before Labour’s problem with antisemitism was in the public.”\n\n\n\n 5.21am GMT \n\nGen Kitchen, the new MP for Wellingborough, said she was “ecstatic” at the result, adding that the double byelection win for Labour shows that people are “fed up” and want change.\n“The people of Wellingborough have spoken for Britain. This is a stunning victory for the Labour party and must send a message from Northamptonshire to Downing Street,” she said.\nAfter the result was announced, Conservative candidate Helen Harrison was swarmed with cameras while leaving the counting hall and declined to say whether her loss was Sunak’s fault, instead saying she was “disappointed”.\nThe byelection in Wellingborough was triggered when voters recalled the former Tory MP Peter Bone after he received a six-week suspension from the Commons when an inquiry found he had subjected a staff member to bullying and sexual misconduct.\nHarrison is the partner of Bone and there was controversy when she was selected as the Conservative candidate.\nHigh-profile Tory MPs have been absent in the constituency and not a single frontbencher endorsed Harrison. Last month, Rishi Sunak dodged the opportunity to endorse her after he was asked whether he was “proud” she had been selected given her connection to Bone. He said it was up to local members to select their candidate.\nHarrison stayed firmly out of the spotlight in the run-up to the byelection. She refused all national media interviews and has not posted on the social media platform X since 11 January, when she announced her selection.\n\n Related: Labour overturns 18,000 Tory majority to win Wellingborough byelection \n\n\n\n\n 5.11am GMT \n\nDamien Egan used his victory speech in Kingswood to thank voters, saying: “Fourteen years of Conservative government have sucked the hope out of our country. There’s a feeling that no matter how hard you work, you just can’t move forward, and with Rishi’s recession we are left once again paying more and getting less.”\nAsked if he had been worried that the turmoil in Labour this week could have put the result in jeopardy, he said candidates worried about everything, including the heavy rain that fell on voting day.\nHe said Labour’s troubles had not come up on the doorstep. “The things that our residents are telling us are the things that Keir and the Labour party have been talking about – the NHS, cost of living crisis, community policing. Kingswood feels neglected after 14 years of Conservative government.”\nThe defeated Conservative candidate, Sam Bromiley, left the count as soon as Egan had finished speaking, declining to comment to reporters.\nNorth East Somerset Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was left to speak to reporters. He highlighted the poor turnout of 37.1%.\n“If you’re a Tory and you stay at home, Rishi Sunak will still be prime minister in the morning,” he said. “I certainly thought this result would be worse.

Skidmore won the seat in 2010 and had built up an 11,220 majority by 2019.\nAs the constituency is abolished at the next general election, Kingswood voters will be divided among four constituencies. Egan had previously been selected as the candidate for one of these, Bristol North East, a key Labour target.\n\n\n\n 5.00am GMT \nWelcome and opening summary\n\nGood morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog as we look at reaction to two byelections with huge implications for the party leaderships of Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer.\nHere are the headlines:\n\nLabour has overturned Tory majorities in Kingswood and Wellingborough to claim victory in two byelections overnight.\nThe byelections took place as the UK slipped into a recession under Sunak’s government, breaking one of his five pledges: to bring growth.\nThe newly reconvened executive in Northern Ireland has agreed an allocation of £685m for public sector pay.\n\nAside from reaction to the byelections, it should be a quiet day in UK politics.

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been warned by leading One Nation group Conservatives it would be “politically disastrous” to veer further to the right after two heavy byelection losses to Labour. The prime minister faces a dilemma over his future strategy as the byelection defeats in Kingswood and Wellingborough showed his party lost votes to a victorious Labour on the left and insurgent Reform UK on the right. After the results he faced calls from Jacob Rees-Mogg and the New Conservatives’ Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates to “reunite the right” and win back Reform voters, as well as those who stayed at home, to “the Tory family”. Cates and Kruger called for tax cuts, more curbs on immigration and welfare and a willingness to withdraw from the European convention on human rights, as the Reform party took 10-13% of the vote in the two seats.   Related: Labour can celebrate byelection wins, but low turnout is cause for concern   But Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation caucus of more than 100 Conservative MPs, said it was wrong to believe the Reform and Tory vote could be added together, and called for the party to unite around current policies. “If we attempt to become the Reform party, we will get the Reform party’s level of support,” he told the Guardian. “It seems politically disastrous to me. “The only thing in a general election year is to unite. Whatever else we need to change, we absolutely need not to be arguing about policies at this stage of the cycle. Colleagues who say we need a different policy approach, those who want the Conservative party to be like the Reform party, will continue to do so but there’s no evidence you can add the Reform vote to the Tory vote and say here’s a new coalition.” Another leading One Nation Conservative said there would be a battle ahead to stop the right of the party pushing to neutralise Reform when “elections are only ever won on the centre ground”. Speaking on Friday morning, the prime minister signalled more tax cuts would be on the way and downplayed the significance of the Reform vote, saying the “actual choice at the general election [is] between me and [Starmer], between the Conservatives and Labour”.  Interactive  Sunak has been facing the threat of a plot from unknown MPs and donors on the right of the party, who funded polling fronted by the Tory peer David Frost predicting he would lead the party to a Labour landslide.  Interactive  But on Friday only one Conservative MP – Andrea Jenkyns – repeated calls for the prime minister to resign. But he came under immediate pressure from Rees-Mogg to try to “reunite the right” by appealing to Reform voters to turn back to the Tories. Conservative MPs also revealed Boris Johnson had been messaging them to ask their views, in a sign the former prime minister may not have given up hope of a political comeback. Two Tory MPs said they had received occasional messages from Johnson over the past months asking for their thoughts on political developments. Both MPs said they last heard from him a month or so ago. Johnson’s continued communication with Conservative MPs is a sign he remains engaged in politics. It will give hope to those who want to see him take an active role in the next Tory election campaign. “It’s things like ‘how are things?’,” one of the MPs said of Johnson’s messages. “People obviously reach out to him as well. It’s classic Boris – he’s not actually saying anything apart from ‘what do you think?’” Johnson’s spokesperson said he could not comment on private conversations. The main criticisms of Sunak came on Friday from Kruger and Cates, the co-chairs of the New Conservatives group of right-leaning Tory MPs, who were among those calling on Sunak to “change course”, urging him to “adapt to the reality that the byelections reveal: our target voters want a different and a better offer”. “The results of yesterday’s byelections are unequivocal,” they said. “Labour are winning because many of the people who backed us in 2019 are staying at home or voting for Reform. Voters are not flocking to Labour. They want a genuine alternative to the consensus politics of the last two decades.” They called on Sunak to reduce legal migration, cut income tax and declare the UK was willing to pull out of the European convention on human rights. Another leading Conservative MP, Paul Scully, told GB News that more vision was needed alongside tax cuts to help with the cost of living crisis. “I think tax cuts is a single measure in the budget that won’t necessarily bed in unless you’ve got a vision around it,” he said. “Any tax cuts that do get put in place, I think they’ve got to affect a wide amount of people. That fiscal drag, tackling tax thresholds, these kinds of things are affecting hundreds of thousands of people, nurses and public sector workers that wouldn’t necessarily be expected to be suddenly paying a high rate. That’s what we’ve got to look at now. “But we’ve also got to set out a vision on housing. What are we going to do for young people? What are we going to do about migration in a sensible way that’s achievable? Politics is the art of the possible.” The double defeat was the source of a sour mood among Tory MPs. One described the results as a “blow to the stomach”, while another described them as “really appalling but not unexpectedly appalling”. Some MPs and grassroots members are convinced that a Johnson comeback is their greatest hope of turning around their political fortunes. The former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said this month that Sunak should “swallow some pride” and bring Johnson back to frontline politics. “Something has to change, for us to have a chance of winning,” he told GB News. Sunak told ITV this month he still occasionally speaks to Johnson and refused to rule out bringing him back into his top team. “I’m proud of the work that we did together,” he said. “And we worked well together for a long time. In the end there are, you know, well-documented differences.”"

        "content": "The Wellingborough byelection is one for the record books. The fall in the Conservative share of the vote – an enormous 37.6 percentage points – was the worst the party has ever suffered in a byelection. The previous record, established in Liverpool Wavertree in 1935, had stood for nearly 90 years, but the swing of 28.5 percentage points from Conservative to Labour was the second-highest since the 1930s, after Tony Blair’s triumph in Dudley West in 1994. It came on the heels of other Labour gains in the last year with monster-sized swings of more than 20 points: Selby and Ainsty, Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire. Thatcher and Blair in opposition managed two such gains each; Starmer has notched up four. The swing to Labour in Kingswood was much less spectacular than in Wellingborough, but still a perfectly respectable 16.4 points, in the same bracket as byelections in Wirral South (1997) and Norwich North (2009), each of which took place less than a year before a change of government. It was approximately what one would expect given the national polls show a Labour lead approaching 20 points. The difference between the swings must owe something to the Conservatives’ choice of candidates for each seat: the partner of the disgraced former MP in Wellingborough and a well-liked local councillor in Kingswood. It also reflects the fact that Labour had fallen further in recent elections, and therefore had more room for improvement, in Wellingborough. The two results together, late in the government’s term, show that the polls are not wrong in pointing to a big swing from Conservative to Labour and that the government is approaching the next election in very bad shape.   Related: The voters of Wellingborough and Kingswood said one thing with one voice: the Tory era is over | Polly Toynbee   There are other electoral trends worth noting. One is that turnout is declining. The turnout in both byelections was poor, worse than Mid Bedfordshire last October but slightly better than Tamworth. The fall in Kingswood, usually a constituency with high participation, was particularly large, perhaps because of bad weather on polling day. While many of the missing voters will be former Conservatives, abstention is a form of protest and the Tories cannot count on persuading them to return when the general election takes place. It seems likely that the next election, like 1997, will see a significant fall in turnout alongside a big drop in the Conservative vote. Reform UK fared reasonably in both byelections, although 10% in Kingswood and 13% in Wellingborough are a long way short of the results Ukip was achieving in the run-up to the 2015 election. Wellingborough, which voted 63% for leave in the referendum and where the Conservative campaign was in disarray, should have been fertile ground but the campaign never quite took off. As with abstainers, it is foolish for Conservatives in search of a silver lining to lump Reform voters in with the Tories as a rightwing bloc that will come home at the general election; they are protest voters and many of them were expressing strong negative feelings about the government. But the Reform vote will sow discord among the Conservatives about how to respond to defeat. The Greens saved their deposit in Kingswood, not a bad result given the two-party squeeze. This could reflect disappointment over Labour dropping the £28bn package, but it also comes in the context of the environmentalist reasons for Chris Skidmore’s resignation and the credibility of the Greens in the Bristol area. Another point to note is that the Westminster ructions about Labour’s bad week – the policy retreat and the mess over its repudiated candidate in the Rochdale byelection – seems to have made little impact on the voters. The byelections were determined by deeper factors: the recessionary economy, strained public services, the unpopularity of the government and the prime minister, and the strong feeling of “time for a change”.  The government is in deep, almost certainly terminal trouble and it is running out of time."

        "content": "Keir Starmer has hailed Labour’s “fantastic” results in the Kingswood and Wellingborough byelections after the party secured two victories that suggest the party is on course for a majority at the general election this year.\nThe Labour leader said the gain of two relatively safe Conservative seats showed voters wanted change and trusted his party to deliver it.\nThe party secured a near-record swing of 28.5 percentage points in Wellingborough and a more modest one of 16.4 points in Kingswood, both of which would give them a secure majority if repeated at a national vote.\n\n Related: Labour can celebrate byelection wins, but low turnout is cause for concern \n\nStarmer said in a statement: “These are fantastic results in Kingswood and Wellingborough that show people want change and are ready to put their faith in a changed Labour party to deliver it.”\nSeparately, he told BBC Breakfast: “I was very pleased last night to see that we were clearly getting Tory switchers, in other words, people who hadn’t voted for the Labour party before, coming out last night and voting for the Labour party in a byelection.” \nRishi Sunak said the circumstances around both byelections had been “particularly challenging”. He added: “We’ve clearly been through a lot over the past couple of years as a country, but I genuinely believe at the start of this year we’re pointing in the right direction.”\n Interactive\n\nThe swing in Wellingborough, where 28-year-old Gen Kitchen overturned a Conservative majority of 18,000, would be enough that if repeated at a general election it could see the Tories win just four seats. It is Labour’s biggest swing from the Tories since 1994, and the second biggest since the war.\nKitchen said: “This is a stunning victory for the Labour party and must send a message from Northamptonshire to Downing Street.”\nThe circumstances in that vote were unusual, however, given the Conservative candidate, Helen Harrison, is the partner of the former MP Peter Bone, who was recalled by voters after being found to have bullied a member of staff.\n Interactive\n\nIn Kingswood, where Damien Egan won with a majority of about 2,500, the swing to Labour would give it a majority of about 60 seats if repeated nationally. The victory was more modest, however, than its wins in three byelections last year, reflecting a slight drop in Labour’s poll lead since then.\nThe results will provide welcome relief for Starmer, who has endured a bruising two weeks after dropping his pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment and suspending two Labour candidates who were recorded making derogatory remarks about Israel.\nStarmer said on Friday: “I’ve taken two tough and ruthless decisions in the last 10 days. Has it been bumpy? Yes, of course. It’s been bumpy but were they the right decisions is the question I asked myself, and they were the right decisions.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConservatives said on Friday they could still win a general election, pointing out the low turnout and the strong results for Reform UK, which won more than 10% in both seats. Some Tories believe they will boost turnout and squeeze the Reform vote when voters are forced to decide between Starmer and Sunak.\nRichard Holden, the Tory party chair, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “People know in a byelection, they’re not voting to change the government. And I think to extrapolate from that to a general election isn’t quite right.”\nThe result is likely to exacerbate divisions about the future direction of the party. Some want the prime minister to shift to the right in an effort to recapture Reform UK voters, while others warn that doing so would put other more centrist seats at risk.\nThe former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the prime minister to “reunite the right wing of politics”.\n“I think we win their support by concentrating on the areas where we [the Tories and Reform UK] agree,” he said. “That means getting into a position where taxes are reduced [and] dealing with the ridiculous net zero proposals that are becoming unaffordable and are closing down industry in this country.”\nHolden said Sunak’s focus would remain on cutting inflation. “It doesn’t really matter if your taxes are coming down if you’re seeing inflation eating away at your wages,” he said.\nScott Brown, a Conservative councillor in Wellingborough, told the BBC: “We’re losing any kind of identity at the moment. You’ve got the Nat Cons coming in and all kinds of other little subgroups, and that makes it difficult to get a consistent message.”\nTim Montgomerie, the founder of the grassroots website Conservative Home, tweeted: “It’s over for the Tories. Absolutely over. We didn’t do what we said we’d do and did the things we said we wouldn’t. The longer Sunak delays the election date the angrier the electorate are going to get.”\nEven if Sunak does decide to chase Reform voters, pollsters say they are unlikely all to switch to the Tories. \nJohn Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: “[These results provide] yet further evidence tonight that the Conservatives are in trouble – that wasn’t particularly new. It’s just that there’s a new aspect of that trouble.”"

        "content": "The possible return of Donald Trump to the White House represents an existential threat to European security that can only be resolved if Britain becomes a clear defence partner with the rest of Europe, one of Emmanuel Macron’s close party allies has said. Benjamin Haddad, a former head of the Atlantic Council Europe programme and one of those closest to French foreign policy thinking, has long argued that fundamental changes in US politics symbolised by Trump’s popularity require European defence to become more autonomous from the US. The member of the French parliament’s European committee said in an interview: “2024 is existential for Europe. If we end up in a situation where America stops helping Ukraine, which is a likely scenario, we have two choices. Either we say we do not have the means to help Ukraine any more and we go to a negotiation that is more favourable to Putin and look the other way, and as a result we encourage further aggression down the road not only in Ukraine but elsewhere. Or we put in motion the means to help Ukraine to be able to defend itself without the US, and that is what Macron advocated recently.”   Related: UK could contribute to nuclear shield if Trump wins, suggests German minister   Haddad was in London in part to discuss what role the UK could play in the development of a stronger European defence arm. His visit has been given added urgency due to the open threats by Trump to Nato’s future, as well as the impasse in the US Congress on a Ukraine aid package The author in 2019 of Paradise Lost, a book examining the implications of Trump’s rise for Europe, said: “In 2016 when Trump was elected many Europeans and Americans wanted to think this was an accident of history or a consequence of Russian interference in the media, but not that it was the harbinger of things to come and deeper trends. “The polls are currently much more favourable to Trump than in 2016 and obviously we do not know what he will do in office, but Trump does not have to formally leave Nato to represent a challenge to the credibility of the alliance. “The uncertainty already is a strategic challenge for Europe especially when it comes to Ukraine. I fear it is much harder for Congress to come to a compromise on a package of aid in an election year. We have to read the writing on the wall. There is in the US a long-term pivot to south-east Asia, and to unilateralism. “The Americans have been warning us for a long time. Robert Gates, the US defence secretary under Barack Obama, warned that the next generation of Americans will not be willing to pay for European’s security.” Haddad said the best way to keep the transatlantic alliance strong was for European defence to become stronger, arguing that those who say this might repel the US were trapped in an obsolete way of thinking. “It is extraordinarily counterproductive to think you can keep Americans anchored in Europe by showcasing our weakness, divisions and inability to act. That is what will drive them away.” He said the convergence of thinking across Europe about the scale of the Russian threat had already transformed the size of European defence budgets, but Europe now needed to put weapons production on a war footing, adopt Estonia’s plan for defence bonds to build a stronger common European defence procurement capacity that gives industry certainty, and also start to raid Russian central bank assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction. He also said that if voters were to accept higher defence spending, they would expect more of that spending to boost jobs in Europe rather than in the US or South Korea. He was frank that for a European defence arm to be strong, the UK had to be involved. “There is no credible thinking about long-term European sovereignty on defence without bringing the UK in a robust way. After Brexit we had a missed opportunity when Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, proposed a security and defence treaty with the EU and the offer was not taken up. I hope it is something we can revamp in the context of Ukraine and the American elections.” He said Europe had to contemplate the implications of losing the American nuclear umbrella. “In France the subject of nuclear sharing has been very taboo, and France is not part of the Nato nuclear planning group, but President Macron has said multiple times now our vital interests have a European dimension, so he has proposed a conversation with Europe on this. “We are not talking about the idea of sharing decisions, but the idea of how the French and British nuclear deterrent can be useful for the security of Europe.” He praised the British foreign secretary, David Cameron, for being willing to challenge the Republican unilateralists in the US. But he said it was also necessary to “listen very seriously” to the caustic responses to Lord Cameron’s arguments from Republicans. “We need to ask ourselves if we want to rely on the voters of Montana, Wisconsin and Michigan to keep Europe safe. Basically, Europe’s security would be flipping a coin every four years.”"

        "content": "The records continue to fall for Labour. The result in the Wellingborough byelection, in which the party achieved a 28.5 percentage-point swing from the Conservatives, was the biggest Labour victory over the Tories since 1994 and the second biggest since the war. Along with the victory in Kingswood, the party has now made six byelection gains since 2019 – the most it has made in a single parliament. The Conservatives have lost 10 byelections in that time – the most they have ever lost in a single parliament. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called the results “fantastic”, adding: “By winning in these Tory strongholds, we can confidently say that Labour is back in the service of working people and we will work tirelessly to deliver for them.” Labour’s swing in both seats was large enough that if repeated at a general election, the party would easily secure a majority.  Interactive  On a swing of 16.4 points, as seen in Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, Labour would have a majority of about 60 seats. If the result in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was repeated nationally, it would be apocalyptic for the Conservatives. On one calculation it would give them just four seats in a general election.  Interactive  John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, wrote on Friday morning: “These two results suggest the Conservatives still have a mountain to climb. Indeed, at the moment, they still seem to be struggling to get even so far as base camp.” For Starmer, the results are a welcome relief after a month dominated by headlines first about his U-turn on his green investment plans and then the controversy surrounding two of its candidates in the north-west who were recorded making derogatory remarks about Israel. Labour officials, however, will be slightly concerned that the Wellingborough result is an anomaly, given that the Tory’s candidate was Helen Harrison, the partner of the constituency’s former MP, Peter Bone, who was recalled after being found to have bullied a staff member. One Tory activist said: “None of us wanted to campaign in Wellingborough, we just couldn’t face having to justify our choice of candidate.” If Kingswood is more representative of national opinion, it suggests the Labour lead is softening slightly after three byelections last year where the swing was more than 20 points on each occasion. Recent polls suggest the party has dropped in the polls since Starmer’s decision to scrap his £28bn-a-year green spending plans – though none have been conducted since Thursday’s announcement that the country entered a recession at the end of last year. The Tories tried to put a gloss on the defeats on Friday, highlighting the low turnout in both seats. Just 37% of voters turned out in Kingswood, and 38% in Wellingborough – below the mid-40s seen in recent byelections in Mid Bedfordshire, Somerton and Frome, and Selby and Ainsty. In both seats, the increase in Labour support was just half the drop in the Conservatives’ vote, suggesting that the opposition party is not fully capitalising on the government’s unpopularity. If the Conservatives can persuade their voters to come out at a general election, party officials have said, they can still keep hold of power. Some are also keen to point out the success of Reform UK at both byelections, securing more than 10% of the vote in each. “We have fought robust campaigns on the ground in both of these seats with local candidates,” said a Tory official. “But these byelections were always going to be hard. The government of the day rarely win byelections.” The former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “I certainly thought this result would be worse … If we can reunite the right in politics there’s a real opportunity for us.” Rees-Mogg has been at the forefront of efforts by Tory backbenchers to get the prime minister to tack to the right to claw back voters from Reform. Responding to Thursday’s economic data, one Conservative MP said Sunak should “cut business and personal taxes, reduce immigration, adopt radical measures to increase the size of the indigenous workforce”. Sunak’s problem, however, is that he is losing votes on both sides and that any move to the right risks losing support, especially in the southern suburban seats being targeted by the Liberal Democrats. Labour’s concern, however, is one identified by Starmer at the beginning of the year: that voters are not really moving their way but are instead so disillusioned with politics that they are staying at home. “The message on the doorstep was the same everywhere I went,” said one Labour activist. “Voters hate all of us.”"

        "content": "Labour has scored its largest swing in a byelection since 1994 after overturning a majority of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough, bolstering predictions that the party is on course for a landslide victory at the next general election.\nLabour’s candidate, Gen Kitchen, won with 13,844 votes, beating the Conservatives’ Helen Harrison who received 7,408 votes in the largest swing from the Tories to Labour since 1994 and second-largest since the second world war. It was Labour’s fifth byelection gain from the Conservatives overall in this parliament. The party also gained a Tory seat in Kingswood, dealing a double blow to an embattled Conservative party that has lost 10 byelections in a single parliament, more than any government since the 1960s.\nLabour achieved its largest swing in a byelection since 1994 with 28.5%. Turnout stood at 38.1% in Wellingborough and 37.1% in Kingswood, fairly low figures compared with other recent byelections in England. Tamworth and Somerton and Frome recorded lower turnouts but contests in Uxbridge, Selby and Ainsty and Mid Bedfordshire saw figures in the mid-40s.\n Interactive\n\nSpeaking after her win, Kitchen said: “The people of Wellingborough have spoken for Britain. This is a stunning victory for the Labour party and must send a message from Northamptonshire to Downing Street.”\nThe wins in Wellingborough and Kingswood will temper fears that a testing week for Labour has significantly threatened its electoral prospects and will further bolster predictions that the party stands to win a large majority at the next general election.\nHarrison appeared at the count about two hours before the results were announced. She was in high spirits, posing for photographs and telling reporters she was feeling “good”. She also appeared on good terms with Reform UK, at one point calling over the party’s leader, Richard Tice.\nAfter the result was announced, Harrison was swarmed with cameras while leaving the counting hall and declined to say whether her loss was Sunak’s fault, instead saying she was “disappointed”. She said she would “absolutely” be running again before complaining she could not see because of the bright camera lights in her face. A car was waiting for Harrison outside the venue which she swiftly entered as supporters caught up to applaud her before the car drove off.\nReform UK achieved its best result in an election so far, winning 13% of the vote, beating the record set about an hour earlier in Kingswood, where the party reached 10% of the vote. Ben Habib, the party’s candidate in Wellingborough, said the result was a staging post for the party’s growth, adding “the world is our oyster”.\nWhen asked whether standing would lead to greater Tory losses and hand Labour a stronger mandate to enact policies the party opposes, Habib said: “I’m not into being a weathervane for the Conservative party. I’m not in it to make sure we get minor policy adjustments which suit our view of life. We need a 180 degree handbrake U-turn from the policy direction that the Conservative party has taken and that Labour will frankly continue.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe byelection in Wellingborough was triggered when voters recalled the former Tory MP Peter Bone after he received a six-week suspension from the Commons when an inquiry found he had subjected a staff member to bullying and sexual misconduct.\nHe won the Northamptonshire constituency at every general election from 2005 to 2019, with Labour coming second in four of the five contests and Ukip doing so in 2015. His majority in 2019 was 36%. Bone did not attend Thursday night’s count.\nThere was further controversy after Bone’s partner, Harrison, was selected as the Conservative candidate. High-profile Tory MPs have been absent in the constituency and not a single frontbencher endorsed Harrison. Last month, Rishi Sunak dodged the opportunity to endorse her after he was asked whether he was “proud” she had been selected given her connection to Bone. He said it was up to local members to select their candidate.\nHarrison stayed firmly out of the spotlight in the run-up to the byelection. She refused all national media interviews and has not posted on the social media platform X since 11 January, when she announced her selection.\nThe result will be welcomed by Keir Starmer, who has had one of his most challenging weeks since becoming Labour leader after two of the party’s parliamentary candidates were suspended in the space of 24 hours over comments relating to Israel. On Wednesday, a Savanta poll had Labour’s lead over the Conservatives down by seven points, its lowest since June 2023.\nOn Sunday, remarks made by Azhar Ali, Labour’s candidate in the Rochdale byelection, surfaced in which he said Israel had deliberately relaxed security before the 7 October Hamas attack after warnings of an imminent threat. After initially backing Ali, Starmer withdrew support for him on Monday evening.\nLess than 24 hours later, the party suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn, after a recording surfaced of him suggesting world leaders privately bemoaned “fucking Israel”.\nSpeaking before the result, Toby Perkins, the shadow nature and rural affairs minister, said the suspension of Ali and Hyndburn did not come up on the doorstep, adding the win would give the party a lift.\nLast week, Starmer formally dropped his flagship target of spending £28bn a year on green investment, citing poor economic conditions, despite support for the policy from the public and warnings from business leaders to keep it.\nLabour last held Wellingborough between 1997 and 2005, losing it in that year’s general election to Bone. During the Tony Blair years Wellingborough was a swing seat. Labour won it in 1997 with a majority of just 187 votes and lost it in 2005 by 687.\nIn recent years the constituency has been a Tory stronghold, with the Conservatives winning with a majority of 18,540 in 2019.\nFor the Conservatives, the loss of another safe seat could prompt long-shot attempts by backbenchers on the right of the party – who are already at odds with the prime minister over the Rwanda bill – to replace Sunak as leader before the next general election."

        "content": "She wears Dr Martens boots, loves Dua Lipa and clears her head by lifting weights. It is safe to say that Carmen Smith, who is to become a Plaid Cymru peer at the age of 27, will not be a typical member of the House of Lords. But Smith hopes that by taking up a seat, in an institution she disapproves of, she will help change the feel and look of the place. “I don’t believe in the House of Lords,” she said. “It’s an unelected chamber and it’s not a diverse space. But I believe that we should have Welsh voices anywhere where legislation is made that affects people in Wales. “Until the Lords doesn’t exist we should be represented there. And hopefully the work I can do will bring more voices into that space. Perhaps make that space look different as well.” Speaking at the Chapter arts centre in Cardiff, fresh from a gym session in which she had achieved a leg-press personal best, Smith said she had been stung by some of the critics who have claimed she was too young for the job – and only got it because she was a woman.  My thoughts on Carmen Smith as @Plaid_Cymru Lords nominee.▪️Unelected HoL should be abolished▪️But where Wales is debated we should be represented▪️She was nominated following  party election▪️Some seem to have issue with fact she's a 27 y/o woman. I don't. It's refreshing.— Rhun ap Iorwerth (@RhunapIorwerth) February 12, 2024  “I take fair criticism. You should always have scrutiny,” she says. “But in terms of my age and my gender, it has been difficult to receive a lot of negativity over the last few days. I wouldn’t be human if I didn’t feel that, but I’m hoping by doing this the next young woman or next person from a different background doesn’t have as much of this. It’s about breaking that wall. Sadly I was expecting it, but it has hit me harder than I thought it would.” Smith, a former chief of staff for Plaid’s Senedd group, came second behind a man in the vote for the party’s Lords nomination, but the process included a mechanism to ensure a woman was the first nominee. She said: “Plaid is a party of equality. I think it’s a good thing. Especially in this election it’s important, because the chamber is 70% men. You do need to take some action to change that.” The party was hit last year by a damning report that exposed misogyny, bullying and harassment. “We’re not going to be able to make change unless we’re more proactive about it,” she said. Smith said young people were capable of “incredible things”, citing Plaid contemporaries who had campaigned brilliantly on issues such as free school meals and period poverty. “I don’t think that campaign would have come from a 71-year-old in the House of Lords,” she said. Smith is the youngest of seven siblings and grew up in Ynys Môn (Anglesey) in north Wales. Her father worked for British Steel and she shared the caring duties for him when he was diagnosed with dementia. She has had a paid job since she was 14 and has served as the deputy president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in Wales. At the moment she works in comms for a green energy company, but will give up that job to serve in the Lords. She is certain Wales will become independent in her lifetime – and would not include a body like the Lords. “My generation is more in favour [of independence] than the generations before me. There will be a majority of people in the future who will support independence.” Smith is heading to London on Friday to learn about the logistics of the new job. She wants to wear fake fur rather than ermine, and hopes she’ll be able to wear her Dr Martens. “I’m sure I’ll be given a handbook on the dress code. I’m pretty sure nobody in the Lords currently wears Docs.” She hopes to stay in Cardiff and commute by train. Her title hasn’t been nailed down, but she may become Baroness (Lady) Smith of Llanfaes. “That’s where I grew up. It’s an area that’s quite underprivileged and it would be good to shine a light on it.” Smith intends to make her Lords oath in Welsh as well as English. “That’s something I’d like to do in terms of championing the Welsh language and culture.” She says she has no intention of staying in the Lords for years. “I’ll be happy to hand the baton on to someone else. I don’t know what the future looks like but I just want to feel like I’m making an impact.”"

        "content": "Labour has overturned an 11,000-plus Tory majority to win the byelection in the South Gloucestershire constituency of Kingswood.\nDamien Egan, who resigned as the mayor of Lewisham in south-east London to contest the seat even though it is being abolished at the next general election, is celebrating victory after a professional and energetic Labour campaign. He won with 11,1176 votes, to 8,675 for his nearest rival, the Conservatives’ Sam Bromiley, a majority of 2,501. Labour won on a swing in the share of the vote of 16.4 percentage points – some way above the 11.4 point swing needed.\n Interactive\n\nLabour also overturned a Tory majority of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough, dealing a double blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of clinging on to power at the next general election. Even before the result came in the prime minister was criticised for presiding over an insipid effort to defend Kingswood.\nThe result will come as a relief to Labour following the antisemitism scandal that has engulfed the party this week. But the alarm bells may sound over the size of the Reform UK vote, which came in third with 10.4% – the party’s best byelection result so far this parliament and since it rebranded from the Brexit party in 2021.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “This is a fantastic result in Kingswood that shows people are ready to put their trust in a Labour government. By winning in this Tory stronghold, we can confidently say that Labour is back in the service of working people and we will work tirelessly to deliver for them … Labour will give Britain its future back.”\nEgan used his victory speech to thank voters, saying: “Fourteen years of Conservative government have sucked the hope out of our country. There’s a feeling that no matter how hard you work, you just can’t move forward, and with Rishi’s recession we are left once again paying more and getting less.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he had been worried that the turmoil in Labour this week could have put the result in jeopardy, he said candidates worried about everything, including the heavy rain that fell on voting day.\nHe said Labour’s troubles had not come up on the doorstep. “The things that our residents are telling us are the things that Keir and the Labour party have been talking about – the NHS, cost of living crisis, community policing. Kingswood feels neglected after 14 years of Conservative government.”\nThe defeated Conservative candidate, Sam Bromiley, left the count as soon as Egan had finished speaking, declining to comment to reporters.\nNorth East Somerset Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was left to speak to reporters. He pointed out that if you add together the Reform UK and Conservative vote it is more than Labour’s. “If we can reunite the right in politics there’s a real opportunity for us,” he said.\nRees-Mogg also highlighted the poor turnout of 37.1%. “If you’re a Tory and you stay at home, Rishi Sunak will still be prime minister in the morning,” he said. “I certainly thought this result would be worse. Bear in mind a lot of the postal votes would have been back before Labour’s problem with antisemitism was in the public.”\nThe byelection was called after Chris Skidmore, a leading Tory voice on green issues, resigned in protest against the government’s dash for oil and gas.\nOver the last half century, Kingswood has swung between the Tories and Labour. Skidmore won the seat in 2010 and had built up an 11,220 majority by 2019.\nAs the constituency is abolished at the next general election, Kingswood voters will be divided among four constituencies. Egan had previously been selected as the candidate for one of these, Bristol North East, a key Labour target.\nAfter Skidmore stepped down, Egan resigned from his Lewisham job and headed to South Gloucestershire to fight for Kingswood. Labour poured MPs and activists into the area behind him, seeing it as a way of maintaining the impetus of its push for Downing Street and as an important test of its hopes of challenging the Tories and the Liberal Democrats in south-west England.\nEgan, who was raised in Kingswood, a constituency on the edge of Bristol with a mixture of suburbs, housing estates and villages, said he had been shocked by the decline of the area under the Tories when be began banging on doors in the constituency. He said some of the streets were “filthy” and that it was difficult to see a doctor or dentist. The point was made by images of people queueing to register for an NHS dentist in Bristol.\nThe fatal stabbing of Mason Rist, 15, and Max Dixon, 16, in the Knowle West area of Bristol happened during the campaign. Egan said there needed to be more police on the streets, and during a campaign visit by Keir Starmer to Egan’s old school, Hanham Woods academy, Starmer said the Tories had lost control over knife crime.\nThe Conservatives’ main line seemed to be that their candidate, who leads the party’s group on South Gloucestershire council, was the only real local person standing. One Tory councillor described Egan as the “lad from Lewisham”.\nBromiley previously said his experience as a youth worker would help him tackle crime among young people, promised to stop the Labour-led local council from “hacking into the greenbelt” and said he would work to regenerate the high street.\nJohn Curtice, professor of practice, politics, at Strathclyde University, told the BBC: “Clearly a bad result for the Conservatives, but it’s not quite the big success for Labour on quite the scale that perhaps Sir Keir is trying to claim.”\nRichard Jobson, a lecturer in 20th-century British history at the University of Exeter and an expert on the Labour party, said the Labour win was not a surprise.\nHe said: “The soon to be defunct Kingswood constituency has often been held up as an accurate barometer of the wider public’s mood. Despite a distant industrial past, the area now contains a significant number of the type of suburban voters who flocked to New Labour in droves in 1997. In public, Labour have adopted a routinely cautious tone. In private, I expect that they will have not been countenancing anything short of gaining the seat.”\nLabour’s wins in Kingswood and Wellingborough means the Conservatives have now lost 10 byelections in the course of this parliament – two more than the eight defeats suffered by the 1992-97 Conservative administration led by John Major. It means the Conservative government has lost more byelections in a single parliament than any government since the 1960s."

        "content": "Polls have closed in two byelections where Labour is seeking to take seats from Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party. In Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, the Tories were defending a majority of more than 18,000; and in Kingswood in South Gloucestershire its majority from the 2019 general election was more than 11,000. The results are expected in Wellingborough at about 4am on Friday, with Kingswood expected to declare between 2am and 5am. Labour is considered the favourite to win both seats. A Conservative source sounded downbeat about the result for Sunak’s party. “We have fought robust campaigns on the ground in both of these seats with local candidates. But these byelections were always going to be hard. “The government of the day rarely win byelections. Both of these seats have been Labour recently and they require smaller swings than were seen in recent byelections.” Pat McFadden, Labour’s election coordinator, said: “We are proud of the positive campaigns we have run in Kingswood and Wellingborough. We were always aware of the challenge ahead of us with the large Conservative majorities in both seats, which are both beyond our target list for a general election. “Our campaigns have focused relentlessly on the cost of living and delivering for working people. We have highlighted that people in Kingswood and Wellingborough deserve better than a Tory government which has presided over 14 years of failure and left the economy in tatters. Rishi’s recession means this Tory government is unable to concentrate on what matters to people in both these areas and across the country. “It will be some time before we know the results, but we are making real progress in all corners of our country.” The Wellingborough byelection was called after veteran Brexit-supporter Peter Bone was recalled by voters after the parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. The party generated further local anger by selecting Bone’s partner, Helen Harrison, as its candidate. The Kingswood byelection was called after Tory MP Chris Skidmore resigned in protest at Sunak’s decision to allow new oil and gas licences to be issued. In contrast to low-profile campaigns from the Conservative party, Labour has had a strong presence on the streets of Wellingborough, with MPs Yvette Cooper, Tulip Siddiq and Feryal Clark among those supporting Labour candidate Gen Kitchen.  Looking forward to (hopefully) welcoming @Gvkitchen to Parliament!If you live in Wellingborough, don’t forget to vote in the by-election today! #VoteLabour pic.twitter.com/wAd8Z2yBiM— Tulip Siddiq (@TulipSiddiq) February 15, 2024  Keir Starmer visited football club AFC Rushden and Diamonds with Kitchen on Tuesday. On polling day, the Labour leader was carrying out phone canvassing of both constituencies from the party’s London HQ accompanied by musician turned clean water campaigner Feargal Sharkey. Also campaigning in person in Wellingborough on Thursday was Reform UK deputy co-leader Ben Habib, who was seeking for the party to get its record share of the vote at a byelection. The party has been polling at near 10% in some national polls. Standing on a platform opposing net zero policies, Habib had told the FT he had been buoyed up by “lots of waves and tooting of horns” when driving the party’s battlebus. Damien Egan, the Labour candidate in Kingswood, grew up in the constituency, but had been living in London. He resigned as the mayor of Lewisham last month. The Tory candidate in Kingswood, Sam Bromiley, leads the party’s group on South Gloucestershire council. His campaign has focused on trying to prevent the local authority building 8,000 new homes in the area, in the same week that the Tory government launched its plans to try to increase housebuilding. The Conservatives have already lost eight byelections during this parliament. Should they lose either of the votes today they will have lost more byelections than any government since the 1960s, eclipsing the eight lost by John Major’s government between 1992 and 1997. Another byelection will be held on 29 February, when Rochdale votes in a campaign that has made national headlines with the Labour and the Green parties withdrawing support from their candidates, and former MPs George Galloway and Simon Danczuk both standing."

        "content": "  4.13pm GMT  End of day summary …  I am just about to wrap up the blog for the day. Here are the headlines …  The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis, in a heavy blow to Rishi Sunak’s promise to kickstart growth. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said that today’s figures demonstrate that “Britain remains trapped in a spiral of economic decline” under Sunak’s government, adding that “we are going backwards” because his economic plan “is not working”. Polls are open in the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections, seen as a final chance for the prime minister to buck predictions that his party is heading for a landslide defeat at the next general election. Results should be due between 2am and 5am. Labour is widely seen as favourite to win both seats. The newly-reconvened executive in Northern Ireland has agreed an allocation of £685m for public sector pay in the country. First minister Michelle O’Neil (Sinn Féin) said “We were determined to make some early decisions and I’m glad that we’ve been able to do that”. Deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly (DUP) said “We know that there’s big challenges within our public services but, of course, we must recognise that the people who deliver those public services, our public servants, deserve fair pay.” Data from the department for energy security and net zero shows that 13% of households in England were in fuel poverty last year. The figures also reveal that well over a third (36.4%) of English households, some 8.91 million, were forced to spend more than 10% of their income, after housing costs, on energy bills. Annual profits at British Gas have soared nearly tenfold, while its parent company announced another £144m payout to shareholders. Areas across England where the highest proportion of ethnic minorities live have the poorest access to GPs, with experts attributing this disparity to an outdated model being used to determine funding. Sadiq Khan unveiled new names for six London Overground lines, including the Windrush line and the Suffragette line. A woman is facing deportation, and being separated from her husband and 10-year-old son, despite a court ruling that the family has the right to live together in the UK. Malwattege Peiris has been told by the Home Office to leave the UK despite the court ruling in her favour The West Midlands police and crime commissioner (PCC) Simon Foster has announced he is taking the home secretary to court over plans to scrap his role and transfer his powers to the region’s mayor. Britain’s public spending watchdog has launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield, the UK’s biggest nuclear waste dump.  That is it from me, Martin Belam, today. I will be back with you bright and early tomorrow, as we will have an early UK politics live blog to take in instant reaction to the byelection results. Thank you for all your comments today. I do always try and read all of them, and often find them helpful. See you tomorrow.     3.52pm GMT   I mentioned earlier that the newly-reconvened executive in Northern Ireland has agreed an allocation of money for public sector pay in the country. The Belfast Telegraph is carrying some quotes from first minister Michelle O’Neil (Sinn Féin) from a press conference in Stormont. She told the media:  We were determined to make some early decision and I’m glad that we’ve been able to do that. I’m delighted to say that today the executive, on the recommendation of the finance minister, has decided to allocate over £685m which will allow conversations now to commence between employers and trade unions in relation to public sector pay.  Deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly (DUP) said:  The people of Northern Ireland deserve public services that work for them. We know that there’s big challenges within our public services but, of course, we must recognise that the people who deliver those public services, our public servants, deserve fair pay. And that’s why this step today of the allocation of £685m for the purposes of negotiation, and hopefully quick settlement, is a really welcome one.  Speaking at the same event, finance minister Caoimhe Archibald (Sinn Féin) said “I think it’s also a good signal coming from this executive that we are working together to deliver for people in the most challenging of circumstances.”     3.21pm GMT   It is slightly more foreign relations than domestic politics, but my colleague, our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour, has written an interesting analysis piece here about David Cameron’s unexpected return to frontline politics as foreign secretary.

PA Media reports the analysis showed the number of appointments where people waited four weeks or longer for a GP last year rose by 38% on 2022’s figures to 17.6 million. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said:  Patients across the country are in a desperate position. It has become commonplace to struggle day after day to get a GP appointment, leaving people in pain and discomfort. What this Conservative government has done to our NHS is nothing short of scandalous. It should be a given that people can see their GP when they need to, not a struggle. That is why the Liberal Democrats are calling for a legal right for all patients to see their GP within seven days, and 24 hours if in urgent need.      3.13pm GMT   We have another reported dog at a polling station. A reader alerted me to this via email, and informed me that the dog is called Maggie.  #dogsatpollingstations #WellingboroughByElection pic.twitter.com/XD5XJPi4BM— David Muller (@DavidMu30761326) February 15, 2024  The Guardian has not independently verified the date and location the photograph was taken, but my own miniature dachshund has barked at the picture when shown it.  Updated at 3.38pm GMT    2.33pm GMT   Our Whitehall editor Rowena Mason has this analysis of Rachel Reeves’ speech this morning The shadow chancellor appeared sure-footed in the face of questions about the Rochdale candidate furore, saying the comments had been made in a private meeting and that Labour could not know everything about what was said behind closed doors. She also batted away queries about what she would do if standing in Jeremy Hunt’s shoes for the budget next month, apart from saying Labour would go for growth with planning reforms and a modern industrial strategy. The question remains about how Labour’s economic offering differs from the Tories’ now that the party has got rid of the £28bn green investment pledge, which, while the subject of political attacks, had polled well with the public. Reeves made noises about matching Tory tax cuts, saying she had “made no secret of the fact that [she] wants taxes on working people to be lower” as long as the money was there to make that possible. But with Sunak and Hunt believed to be pencilling in public spending cuts to fund tax cuts, that could put Labour in a difficult position over whether to follow suit. The shadow chancellor referred to “hard choices ahead”, but went no further in indicating how Labour would deal with a scenario where the Tories go to the polls promising tax cuts on the back of fresh austerity.

As Jessica Elgot reported for us at the time:  Boris Johnson has said he will apologise on national television if Britain were to plunge into recession after a vote to leave the EU. His promise came in response to a caller to radio station LBC, who asked the former mayor of London: “If we Brexit and we go into recession, would you have the political courage, to go on TV … and say sorry, I made it wrong and I apologise?” Johnson promised he would apologise were the UK to slide into recession post-Brexit. “Of course I will,” he said. “I’m not certain what my political career holds anyway. This is far more important than any individual political career. “I don’t think London has anything to fear from coming out of the EU, and neither does Britain. When has our country ever gone wrong by believing in ourselves?”  In February 2023 a report by the Centre for European Reform (CER) in December claimed that Britain’s economy was 5.5% smaller than it would have been had it remained inside the EU.     1.49pm GMT   Tory former chancellor Lord Lamont said he thought there was room for tax cuts in the March Budget. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “I do think tax cuts have to be responsible. I think there is probably some headroom that has been created by very strong growth in tax revenues, particularly as a result of the freezing of the tax thresholds for such a long period. “There may be some headroom. I think looking longer term though, any tax cuts have to be matched by tight control of public spending, probably financed by reductions in public spending.” On the outlook for the UK after it slipped into recession, Lord Lamont said: “I think people ought to be realistic about this. We have an almost perfect storm. We are coming through it, I think there is light at the end of the tunnel now and we just need to hold our nerve.”     1.16pm GMT   I have been looking, but I am yet to see another picture of a dog at a polling station today from either the Wellingborough or Kingswood byelections, which is disappointing to say the least. There is a photo though of Keir Starmer doing phone canvassing with Feargal Sharkey at Labour HQ in London.  I am just handing over to Charlie Moloney for an hour while I have a break.      12.59pm GMT   Anna Isaac and Alex Lawson report for the Guardian Britain’s public spending watchdog has launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield, the UK’s biggest nuclear waste dump. The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises the use of public funds, has announced it will examine whether the Cumbria site is managing and prioritising the risks and hazards of the site effectively as well as deploying resources appropriately and continuing to improve its project management. The findings of its investigation are expected to be published this autumn.   Related: Spending watchdog launches investigation into Sellafield       12.57pm GMT  Cameron: I am not lecturing or telling our 'American friends' what to do over Ukraine funding  Foreign secretary David Cameron has said he is not lecturing or telling “American friends” what to do over funding to Ukraine. Speaking in Poland, Cameron said a US congress vote was “crucial” to helping Ukraine succeed in the war:  We really do want to see Congress pass that money to support Ukraine economically, but crucially militarily in the months ahead. We have to do everything we can to make sure that Ukraine can succeed in this year and beyond. We must not let Putin think he can out-wait us or last us out, and that’s why this vote in Congress is so crucial. And I say this as someone who is not wanting in any way to lecture American friends, or tell American friends what to do. I say it as someone who has a deep and abiding love of the United States – of their democracy, of their belief in freedom – but as someone who really believes in the importance of our alliance.  The comments come just a day after Republican right-winger Marjorie Taylor Greene told Cameron to “look after his own country” and “kiss my ass” after the former prime minister called on Washington to vote through a package of aid for Ukraine for the sake of global security.     12.53pm GMT   While making a media appearance this morning about the rebranding of six London Overground lines with new names – see this story here from my colleague Gwyn Topham – London mayor Sadiq Khan was asked about the suspension of two prospective Labour candidates over accusations of antisemitism. He gave a lengthy and thoughtful response to Sky News on the issue, saying:  What you have to bear in mind is the sensitivities of how people across the country are feeling, those from a Jewish background, those from a Muslim background. Language matters. And when I speak to Jewish Londoners, the way they receive some of these things, they feel scared. They feel frightened. And sometimes this language can be used as a code and I think we’ve got to be cognizant of that, particularly if you aspire to be a member of parliament, or you’ve been a member of parliament. So I’m only going on what I’ve read in the media, so I’ve not seen the transcripts. But as far as I’m concerned, that sort of language isn’t acceptable, and it certainly shouldn’t be acceptable in a party like mine.  At the end of the interview he then went on to say that he was proud to be in a party that was anti-racist and that was tackling antisemitism. However he stumbled over his words and misspoke, saying the party was “proud to be both anti racist, but also antisemitic”. He immediately corrected himself. About ninety minutes ago the Conservative party issued on social media a clipped four second excerpt of the interview in which he just says the words “a party like mine that is proud to be anti-racist and antisemitic” with a caption claiming “Sadiq Khan says the quiet part out loud”, having edited off Khan’s final words. The social media post has been widely criticised as being misleading, with Walthamstow Labour councillor Miriam Mirwitch, who is national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement, commenting:  Sadiq Khan clearly misspoke and you’ve selectively cut the clip short to misrepresent what he said. Both our mayor and the Labour party are working hard to fight antisemitism. Your cynical political point scoring here will only hurt British Jews like me.  Khan is shortly facing re-election up against a Conservative candidate, Susan Hall, who has been shown to have engaged with Islamophobic tropes about the current mayor on social media.

Speaking at a press conference in central London, Reeves opened her speech by saying:  This is deeply worrying news for families struggling to make ends meet, and for businesses. These are provisional figures, they may change. But it is absolutely clear that Britain remains trapped in a spiral of economic decline.  This isn’t a question of lines on a graph. It’s about the health of our high streets, about growing businesses, secure well paid jobs and money in the pockets of working people. The British people did not need to see these figures today to tell them that the economy is not working, that we are in the midst of a cost of living crisis, and that they are worse off. But these numbers shine a spotlight on the scale of that failure. The confirmation of recession exposes a government and a prime minister completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. A government that for too long has looked on economic failure with complacency, content to be the managers of decline. Rishi Sunak claims that he has a plan, but the plan is not working. He claims that the economy has turned a corner, but the economy is shrinking. He claims he doesn’t want to take us back to square one. But we are going backwards.  There is a clip of her speaking here, via Sky News:  \"Rishi Sunak claims that he has a plan. But his plan is not working.

She told the media at her press conference:  That [support] depends on the state of the public finances and the projections set out by the OBR. I objected to the increases in National Insurance when Rishi Sunak tried to increase them as chancellor because I thought it was wrong to increase taxes on working people in the middle of a cost of living crisis. We supported the cuts to National Insurance when the Government finally got around to doing that, but I will never make any commitments either around spending increases or tax cuts without being able to say where the money is going to come from.      11.47am GMT   A little bit before Rachel Reeves was giving her speech on Labour’s plan for economic growth – this does feel very much like I am doing a parallel business live blog today – Jeremy Hunt was continuing his media round. On GB News he said the UK will have “the most competitive business taxes in the world”. PA Media quote him saying:  I have not changed my position, our future as a country is to have the most competitive business taxes in the world, and that’s why in the autumn statement we cut corporation tax.” I’ve never hidden from the fact that I had to increase taxes in my first autumn statement as Chancellor but nor have I ever said anything other than I think the most successful economies in the long run have lighter taxes, and as soon as the chance arose I would start to bring down the tax burden. Independent forecasters say if we stick to that plan we’ll get inflation right down, interest rates could start to fall in a matter of months and that is the thing that matters most to families. When they’re making a choice for the future of this country they want to know that they have people who will do the right thing, even if it’s not always the easy thing.      11.29am GMT   Asked about murmurs this morning from Jeremy Hunt that he was planning to tax cuts which might entail spending cuts on public services, Rachel Reeves says:  I do recognise that our public services are under huge pressure, unlike perhaps the Conservatives do, which is why I’ve said there does need to be an immediate injection of cash into our public services. Which is why we would end the tax break where non-dom’s don’t pay taxes in the country in which they live, why we would end the tax break where private schools are not paying VAT or business rates, why we would change the rules about how the bonuses of private equity managers are taxed. And we would use all of that money to fund an immediate of injection of cash into the public services, which are on their knees today. But then we’ve got to have a serious plan to grow the economy      11.26am GMT   Rachel Reeves says she “rejects entirely” accusations that there is little difference between Labour and Conservative plans on the economy for growth. She said:  We’ve got a comprehensive plan for growth that has been drawn up with business. Let me just give you a few examples of that. Labour would reform the planning system to get Britain building again. There are at the moment, something like £200bn worth of projects waiting for connections to our grid system, but they are being held back by restrictions in the planning rules.  At the moment ittakes something like two years to build a wind farm, but it can take 13 years to get a connection to the grid because of bureaucracies in the system. We need to turn that around so that we get Britain building again and ensure that that crucial national infrastructure is coming online and we are determined to do that.  She went on to say:  We’ve set out reforms to the apprenticeship levy to turn it into a growth and skills levy, to help businesses to train up the next generation of workers and a modern industrial strategy with strategies already published for life sciences, for financial services, and for automotives, and more of those industrial strategies that have been worked on in conjunction with businesses.      11.23am GMT  Reeves: Hunt is being 'dangerous' and 'misguided' in giving a running commentary ahead of March budget  Rachel Reeves has criticised the chancellor Jeremy Hunt for giving a “running commentary” ahead of his March budget, branding his words “dangerous” and “misguided”. She told the media during a Q&A session after giving a speech on Labour’s economic plans:  I do find it extraordinary that the actual Chancellor of the Exchequer is providing a running commentary on his own budget. Now, I worked at the Bank of England for many years, and I’ve been in politics for a long time. Now, I have never seen anything like it with the chancellor giving a running commentary. It is dangerous and it is very misguided, and I would urge him to stop this because it creates the uncertainty that is that we really don’t need.       11.21am GMT   Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor, has said in response to a question about Labour’s plan:  Unlike this prime minister and this chancellor, Kier Starmer and I have got a real plan. A concrete plan for growth. And don’t just take our word for it, take the words of the businesses who have helped us devise these plans, whether it is reform of planning, or of pensions, the national wealth fund and GB energy. This is all about getting the growth in our economy that we need. The Conservatives have no plan. We have a serious plan that we’ve worked on with business and the green prosperity plan is still there. A national wealth fund to invest in carbon capture and storage, in green hydrogen, in our steel industry, as well as GB energy with an endowment to invest in nuclear, tidal and floating offshore wind, there’s a plan. This government don’t have that. A Labour government will have to grow our economy and to secure that growth and investment that we need to turn things round after 14 years of conservative failure.       11.16am GMT   Rachel Reeves has been giving a speech about Labour’s plan for growth. She has asked whether anything in the country works better than it did 14 years ago. She finished the speech by saying:  Do our hospitals, our schools, our police work better than they did 14 years ago? Frankly, does anything in our country work better than when the Conservatives came to power 14 years ago? He is further evidence today in black and white. Britain has fallen into recession. It is time to turn the page on 14 years of Conservative failure. It is time to demand better than managed decline. It is time to start a new chapter for Britain.  She is taking questions now, the first one is from Faisal Islam of the BBC who asked about whether she recognised that it was “a relatively mild recession”, and then about Labour ditching its £28bn green development policy.     10.43am GMT   Labour have just put out an attack video clip on the prime minister over this morning’s economic news, labelling it “Rishi’s recession”. It features Rishi Sunak yesterday saying “I really believe that the economy has turned a corner” followed by a montage of talking head clips from this morning’s news show analysing the news that the country has fallen into recession.  This is Rishi’s recession and it’s working people who will pay the price. pic.twitter.com/h0OGJ7cGT7— The Labour Party (@UKLabour) February 15, 2024  They aren’t the only people trying to pin the recession personally on the prime minister. Earlier this morning Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said:  Rishi’s recession has savaged the British economy by decimating growth and leaving families to cope with spiralling prices. Years of Conservative chaos and a revolving door of Conservative chancellors has culminated in economic turmoil. It’s hardworking Brits forced to pick up the tab for this mess, through high food prices, tax hikes and skyrocketing mortgage bills. This year the country will have the chance to kick out this incompetent and out of touch Government once and for all.  The Liberal Democrats were in coalition with the Conservatives from 2010 to 2015. The Conservatives have had five different Chancellors since July 2019.  Updated at 11.30am GMT    10.28am GMT   Data from the department for energy security and net zero shows that 13% of households in England were in fuel poverty last year. While largely unchanged from 13.1% in 2022, the figure amounts to 3.17 million households. The figures also reveal that well over a third (36.4%) of English households, some 8.91 million, were forced to spend more than 10% of their income, after housing costs, on energy bills, up from 6.66 million in 2022. PA Media reports that Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said:  The numbers of households paying more than 10% of their income on energy is truly shocking, far exceeding previous estimates. The reality is that household energy debt is now at record levels, millions of people are living in cold, damp homes and children are suffering in mouldy conditions.      9.56am GMT   With the caveat that the Guardian has not independently verified the timing and location of this photograph, we appear to have our first dog at a polling station social media post from Wellingborough.

He told viewers:  You will know that chancellors don’t talk about budgets just a few weeks before and that is for a very good reason, because I don’t yet know the final numbers that I will receive from the office for budget responsibility. I would only cut taxes in a way that was responsible, and I certainly wouldn’t do anything that fuelled inflation just when we are starting to have some success in bringing down inflation.  Inflation has dropped over the last year from 11% to 4%, but is still running much higher than the Bank of England’s target of 2%. Questioned if tax cuts would come at the expense of cutting public services, Hunt said:  I am a passionate supporter of the NHS and all our public services, but in the long-run the best thing that I can do as chancellor for the NHS is to make sure that our economy is growing healthily. So what you will see in everything I do in the Budget on March 6 is prioritising economic growth.  He suggested that countries with “lighter taxes” did “tend to grow faster”. Earlier in February the prime minister acknowledged that he has failed to keep his promise to cut healthcare waiting lists in England.     9.36am GMT  Starmer: 'working people' are playing the price for '14 years of Tory economic decline'  Keir Starmer has used today’s GDP figures as another opportunity to call for change, saying that it is working people who are paying the price for what he described as “14 years of Tory economic decline”.  Rishi Sunak has failed to turn the corner on 14 years of Tory economic decline. Britain is hit by a recession and it’s working people who will pay the price.It's time for change. Only Labour will deliver it.— Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) February 15, 2024      9.29am GMT   Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor In one sense, there is no comparison between 2009 and 2023. The former was a severe recession, with output declining by about 6% over a protracted period. In 2023 the economy has essentially stagnated: growing by 0.2% in the first quarter, remaining unchanged in the second quarter and then shrinking slightly in the second half of the year. That said, even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak, the economy showed across-the-board weakness in the fourth quarter, with all three main sectors – services, manufacturing and construction – going backwards. There was also evidence that households had been cutting back on their spending as a result of cost of living pressures and the squeeze from higher interest rates. Governments facing the prospect of a general election always want to generate a feelgood factor before polling day. Britain, in the last three months of 2023, had the opposite: a feel-bad factor. The picture would have been even worse had it not been for a rising population. Gross domestic product per head of population has not risen for seven straight quarters (six falls, one quarter unchanged) stretching back to early 2022. Jeremy Hunt put a brave face on what was clearly unwelcome news for a government. The economy was “turning a corner”, the chancellor said, and forecasters were predicting stronger growth over the coming years. Hunt may well be right. The worst for the economy is now probably over. Read Larry Elliott’s full analysis here: Even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak   Related: Even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak       9.21am GMT  Why are people calling it a 'technical recession'?  Because the amount of growth or shrinkage in the economy is small, you will see the phrase “technical recession” being bandied about a lot today –and I already note some questions about the term in the comments. See, I do read them. Look at this way, a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, so if you have quarters where the economy grows by 0.2%, 0.1%, -0.2%, -0.1% you would have technically entered a recession. However, four quarters where growth was 0.1%, -0.5%, 0.1%, -0.5% wouldn’t be a recession, even though the economy had shrunk by more. Essentially when we are dealing with very small changes, you can fall into a recession which is in effect a flatline. The ONS said growth over the course of 2023 as a whole was estimated at 0.1%, the weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis, excluding the economic collapse in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. The ONS have an explainer on recessions here – The ‘R’ Word: What exactly is a ‘recession’ anyway? – in which Darren Morgan, ONS Director of Economic Statistics is quoted as saying:  A technical recession is widely regarded as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. You could get a -0.1% or +0.1% change, but how different really was the economy at that point in time? I would say it was broadly flat, but some people do get excited about it.  Chief economist at the ONS, Grant Fitzner, adds – and I will try not to take this personally:  I think journalists need something quick and simple to understand, and I guess this [technical recession] meets the bill. But I don’t think anyone would seriously call that a ‘recession’. The common sense understanding of a recession is a prolonged and significant downturn in economic activity. So not just one or two quarters, and not just a 0.1% change, but actually something a bit more substantial.      9.14am GMT  Hunt ‘considering spending cuts’ to fund pre-election tax giveaway  Jeremy Hunt is considering making billions of pounds of spending cuts to fund pre-election tax cuts in the next budget, according to a report. The chancellor is looking at “further spending restraint” after 2025 if official economic forecasts suggest he does not have enough headroom to pay for “smart tax cuts”, the Financial Times reported, citing Treasury insiders. The newspaper said Treasury officials were looking at reducing the projected rise in public spending from 2025 onwards to about 0.75% a year, which would release £5bn to £6bn for tax cuts in this spring’s budget. The cuts would have to be made in unprotected departmental budgets such as adult social care and Ministry of Justice funding for courts and prisons. NHS and schools spending is protected. Read more of Eleni Courea’s report here: Jeremy Hunt ‘considering spending cuts’ to fund pre-election tax giveaway   Related: Jeremy Hunt ‘considering spending cuts’ to fund pre-election tax giveaway       9.12am GMT   Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, has said that the prime minister’s promises on the economy are “in tatters” after it was announced that the UK was in recession. She said:  The prime minister can no longer credibly claim that his plan is working or that he has turned the corner on more than 14 years of economic decline under the Conservatives that has left Britain worse off. This is Rishi Sunak’s recession and the news will be deeply worrying for families and business across Britain. It is time for a change. We need an election now to give the British people the chance to vote for a changed Labour Party that has a long-term plan for more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills.      9.09am GMT  Labour: Hunt's 'insulting' comments on economy show he is 'out of touch'  Labour have suggested Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s comments on the UK entering technical recession meant he and his party were “out of touch” with voters, and demanded a general election. In comments after figures showed the UK economy was in recession, Hunt told broadcasters:  We always expected growth to be weaker while we prioritised tackling inflation, that means higher interest rates, and that is the right thing to do because you can’t have long-term healthy growth with high inflation. But also for families when there is a cost-of-living crisis, when the cost of their weekly shop is going up, their energy bills are much higher, it is the right thing to do. The underlying picture here is an economy that is more resilient than most people predicted, inflation is coming down, real wages have been going up now for six months. If we stick to our guns, independent forecasters say that by the early summer we could start to see interest rates falling and that will be a very important relief for families with mortgages.  Hunt also said that “there are signs the British economy is turning a corner”, claiming:  Forecasters agree that growth will strengthen over the next few years, wages are rising faster than prices, mortgage rates are down and unemployment remains low. Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan – cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.  In his January 2023 pledges, prime minister Rishi Sunak promised “We will grow the economy, creating better-paid jobs and opportunity right across the country.” A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “Jeremy Hunt’s comments are as insulting as they are out of touch. The Conservatives’ failure to take any responsibility for Rishi’s recession show why we need an election.”     9.08am GMT  UK economy in recession as households cut spending  The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed households cut back on spending in response to soaring interest rates and rising living costs. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and a collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output – the technical definition of a recession. Official confirmation of a recession is a blow to the government with an election less than a year away and will embarrass Rishi Sunak, after the prime minister made growing the economy one of his five priorities for government at the start of last year.

The Conservatives are defending majorities of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough in Northants and 11,000 in Kingswood in South Gloucestershire. But Labour is expected to win both contests.

Home secretary James Cleverly has condemned as “utterly deplorable” a huge recorded rise in antisemitic incidents in the UK since the 7 October Hamas attack inside Israel.  I am expecting a quiet day. The Commons, Lords, Senedd and the Scottish parliament are not sitting. In Stormont there are committee meetings. That is about it for the diary.

Reminder: I know you probably all know this, but please don’t tell us how you voted in the comments section – section 66a of the Representation of the People Act 1983 on the requirement of secrecy makes it an offence to publish information about the ballot before the polls close at 10pm. I have to be on my best behaviour too. Many thanks.  "

        "content": "A day after the Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene declared “David Cameron can kiss my ass” over his references to the appeasement of Hitler in an article appealing to US lawmakers to pass a Ukraine funding bill, the UK foreign secretary returned to the theme. Stood alongside his Polish counterpart, Radosław Sikorski, another experienced politician recently recalled to high office, he said: “Today, two foreign ministers stand here just like in the 1930s, when we faced a similar challenge in the case of an aggressive dictator who tried to change the world by force and ignored the sovereignty and inviolability of other countries’ borders.” Ukraine, he said, was “a challenge for our generation”, adding that the last time a dictator in Europe was allowed to invade other countries, Poland suffered the greatest consequences.  With a limited period in office and the stakes so high, Cameron is a man in a hurry, showing a determination to leave a mark during his second chance in government even at the risk of fluttering diplomatic dovecotes. Sikorski, who returned to office last year after the defeat of the rightwing populist Law and Justice party, had the confidence this week to challenge Donald Trump’s transactionalism when the likely US Republican presidential candidate shocked Nato states by saying he would be happy to see Vladimir Putin invade countries that did not meet the target of spending 2% of their GDP on defence.  He said on Thursday, alongside Cameron, that stopping Russian imperialism was a basic condition for preserving freedom and the value system of the civilised world. Of Trump’s comments, he observed that Nato’s article 5 had been activated only once, after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US. Poland had then committed itself to Afghanistan and “did not send the bill to Washington”, he said. Cameron, who with Sikorski appealed for the US Congress to adopt an aid package for Ukraine, is aware he is taking risks and potentially offending supporters of Trump. On Israel as well, he feels inclined to do what he describes as showing some leg – by proposing that the UK might recognise a Palestinian state before any negotiations on a two-state solution are complete. He has also become ever more blunt that he thinks Israel is in breach of international humanitarian law if it fails to provide food, water and fuel to those trapped in Gaza. Cameron was aware his article dispensed with some diplomatic niceties. By writing in the US Congress-focused newspaper the Hill, he wanted to reach his target audience, to urge them to do their duty by the transatlantic alliance. The reference to 1930s appeasement and his grandfather fighting in the second world war was some calculated additional spice. He believes there is a natural majority in the US Senate and House to provide the aid for Ukraine and feels it is legitimate for the UK to help try to unlock it. As to claims he is interfering in the domestic politics of the US, he says to accept that is to accept the thinking of American isolationists that the US can withdraw from the world without any consequence save fewer bills. It is not the first time he has made the argument. On his previous trip to the US he used an Aspen Security Forum to say he was “worried that we’re not doing to do what we need to do” on Ukraine, adding that he wanted to address the argument he had heard repeatedly in US political circles: “Why should we meet these challenges overseas when there are so many challenges at home?” The checklist was simple. Ukraine was not losing. Europe was pulling its weight and paying its fair share. The military objectives were clear. It was a good investment, indeed value for money. Ten per cent of the US defence budget used by the Ukrainians has destroyed half of Russia’s prewar assets. Ukraine’s defeat would leave only two people smiling: Putin in Russia, and Xi Jinping in Beijing. He finished by asking them to recognise that “European security is also American security”. It is an argument that pits him against Donald Trump, someone he had no dealings with as prime minister and is unlikely to have future dealings with if the Conservatives are defeated, as expected, in a general election this year. Although he shares Boris Johnson’s determination to support Ukraine, he has none of Johnson’s illusions that Trump is essentially a liberal New Yorker. The Congress vote and the threatened return of Trump play into a wider discussion in Europe about how it responds politically and militarily. It is a debate in which the naturally pro-European Cameron would like to play a role, including on boosting weapons production. Europe, for its part, is wondering if it will need to ask for the UK’s nuclear weapons to come to its defence in the event of a US pullout. A natural optimist who thought he could persuade voters to reject the isolationism of Brexit, Cameron admits the world has turned into a darker place since he left office in 2016, badly damaged by the misjudgment of staging an arguably unnecessary Brexit referendum. His staff are very aware that it is easy for any UK foreign secretary to watch the pages of history turn without leaving any mark on them. With probably less than 10 months left in office, and two massive world crises playing out, it requires him to move with a speed and pointedness that others might not. He also knows that as long as he makes no major mistakes, he has the confidence of a prime minister who has to focus on trying to win the next election. Rishi Sunak will not be attending the Munich Security Conference this weekend, unlike Cameron and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. From Munich Cameron flies to the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Brazil where he hopes to take on the global south, and those that say the west has shown hypocrisy and double standards over Ukraine and Israel. Once the youngest prime minister since 1812, and never lacking in self-confidence, he hopes his experience in foreign affairs will help him navigate ending one war in Gaza and keeping another in Ukraine alive. It is likely to be a bumpy ride."

        "content": "As she stood beside two union flags in a wood-panelled room, it looked as if Rachel Reeves had stepped into Rishi Sunak’s own press conference room in Downing Street – a deliberate move. The shadow chancellor had been preparing for this moment for months, warning of the heightened risk of recession ever since the last quarter’s GDP figures showed negative growth. Accusing Sunak of putting the economy “into reverse” and leaving his promise of economic growth “in tatters”, Reeves was keen to imprint one phrase on voters’ minds: “Rishi’s recession.” One Labour source said it was “an economic and political moment – for a government to have fallen into recession in an election year, when Rishi Sunak has made his whole argument about growing the economy”. Labour sources say Reeves had wanted to speak directly to the country at such a crucial time, rather than popping up briefly on television screens for a short clip. “The picture we want the country to see is a competent alternative to what you’ve gone through, doubling down on Rachel’s core strength of people looking at her and trusting her,” one source said. They say Reeves is now gearing up to make the election all about economic competence, having put to bed the argument over Labour’s £28bn green investment promise once and for all.   The speech showed Labour trying to get back on the front foot after a difficult few days for the party   Prior to the decision to ditch the pledge, Labour figures had been getting tangled up in questions about how it would be paid for and were fearing Conservative attacks on their spending plans. But having abandoned the £28bn figure after weeks of uncertainty, Reeves and her team now feel they “can prosecute the economic case much more effectively”, one source said. Reeves’s speech showed Labour trying to get back on the front foot after a difficult few days for the party in which its poll lead has slipped slightly, and Keir Starmer has been mired in accusations that he did not act quickly enough to suspend a Labour candidate accused of spreading a conspiracy theory about Israel. The shadow chancellor appeared sure-footed in the face of questions about the Rochdale candidate furore, saying the comments had been made in a private meeting and that Labour could not know everything about what was said behind closed doors. She also batted away queries about what she would do if standing in Jeremy Hunt’s shoes for the budget next month, apart from saying Labour would go for growth with planning reforms and a modern industrial strategy. The question remains about how Labour’s economic offering differs from the Tories’ now that the party has got rid of the £28bn green investment pledge, which, while the subject of political attacks, had polled well with the public. Reeves made noises about matching Tory tax cuts, saying she had “made no secret of the fact that [she] wants taxes on working people to be lower” as long as the money was there to make that possible. But with Sunak and Hunt believed to be pencilling in public spending cuts to fund tax cuts, that could put Labour in a difficult position over whether to follow suit. The shadow chancellor referred to “hard choices ahead”, but went no further in indicating how Labour would deal with a scenario where the Tories go to the polls promising tax cuts on the back of fresh austerity."

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt is considering making billions of pounds of spending cuts to fund pre-election tax cuts in the next budget, according to a report. The chancellor is looking at “further spending restraint” after 2025 if official economic forecasts suggest he does not have enough headroom to pay for “smart tax cuts”, the Financial Times reported, citing Treasury insiders. The newspaper said Treasury officials were looking at reducing the projected rise in public spending from 2025 onwards to about 0.75% a year, which would release £5bn to £6bn for tax cuts in this spring’s budget. Economists have warned that even the current plan for a 1% real-terms increase in public spending every year until 2029 is a fiction. This would require serious cuts in stretched public services. The cuts would have to be made in unprotected departmental budgets such as adult social care and Ministry of Justice funding for courts and prisons. NHS and schools spending is protected. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said last year that Hunt’s giveaways relied on “implausible austerity”. Labour believes that Hunt has baked in these cuts from 2025 onwards as a political trap. During the election campaign the Tories could challenge Labour on whether it would make the cuts or spend more. If Labour decides on the latter, the Tories could argue Labour is planning to cover that extra spending with tax rises and accuse the party of preparing a secret “tax bombshell”. Hunt is considering cutting public spending further because tax cuts are seen as an essential political weapon before a general election. An election is expected later this year. The government’s headroom has become more limited because of higher borrowing costs caused by interest rates remaining high. In December, for the fourth time in a row, the Bank of England decided to hold the base interest rate steady at 5.25%. The base rate is what the Bank charges other lenders to borrow money. A Treasury insider told the FT: “It doesn’t look like the chancellor will have as much space for tax cuts compared to last autumn, so senior folk internally are starting to look at further spending restraint and productivity gains in the future if the numbers move against us again. It is a tough call, but it isn’t clear whether there will be easier alternatives.” Hunt would prefer to cut taxes without cutting future spending, which would draw criticism. His decision depends on how much fiscal headroom the Office for Budget Responsibility gives him. Its latest forecasts were handed to the Treasury on Wednesday. The Bank of England is expected to cut the base interest rate during the course of this year."

The number of registered voters in each constituency must now be within 5% of the “electoral quota” of 73,393, except for five protected island seats.\nSixty-five seats – one in 10 – have no change to their boundaries. Of the 585 seats to have at least some change, 40 will have only small changes to their boundaries.\nSeventy-six seats, including for example Clacton, have been extended beyond their current boundaries to ensure they meet the minimum electoral threshold.\nSeventy-three seats, including Sheffield Central, have been reduced in size, giving up areas to other constituencies in order to balance the number of electors in each seat.\nThe notional results were compiled by Rallings and Thrasher on behalf of BBC News, ITV News, Sky News and the Press Association. Calculations for Scotland by Prof David Denver and those for Northern Ireland by Nicholas Whyte.\nThey analysis shows that, were the last election fought on the new constituency boundaries, the Conservative majority would be 14 seats larger. It also reveals that the swing to Labour required for the party to achieve an overall majority increases by 0.7 percentage points from 12.0 to 12.7.\nEstimated results under the new boundaries increase the Conservatives’ current constituency tally by seven from 365 to 372. Labour’s total is reduced by two from 203 to 201, including the speaker’s seat. This means that Sir Keir Starmer would now need a net gain of 125 seats for a majority.\nNote on map boundaries\nThe Guardian’s map has been sourced from the individual boundary commissions of the UK. The Ordnance Survey will produce their own updated constituency map which will give further granular detail of the boundaries. The recommendations of the boundary commissions are, however, final and have been accepted into law by the privy council. A very small number of postcodes are split between constituencies; in these cases, the search will return the constituency that covers the centre of the postcode area."

        "content": "Overseas students wrongly accused of cheating by the Home Office are developing a television drama pitch, inspired by the success of Mr Bates vs the Post Office in persuading politicians to look again at an unresolved scandal. A group of students still battling to clear their names met earlier this month to begin writing an account of their experiences, which they hope will convey to a wider audience the catastrophic fallout from the Home Office’s decision to cancel about 35,000 international students’ visas amid allegations of cheating. They describe this as a last-ditch attempt to focus public attention on a miscarriage of justice that has been simmering for a decade but never captured mainstream interest.   Related: English test scandal: students and campaigners call on PM to end years of limbo   Nazek Ramadan, the director of Migrant Voice, a charity that has been trying to secure justice for the students since 2017, is running writing workshops with some of the students to help them tell their own stories. She has been frustrated by how hard it has been to get politicians and newspaper readers to engage with the English language test scandal. “If it takes a drama to make people understand, then we’ll make a drama. We’ve been inspired by how people have responded to the Post Office drama, and there are so many parallels,” she said. “This is a huge injustice that most people still don’t know about. Thousands of students, young men and women who came here in good faith, had their lives ruined. We want people to empathise and support them. What they went through must be documented.” Ramadan first met students affected by the scandal in 2017 when they visited the charity she runs looking for advice on how to shake off the Home Office’s allegations of cheating, which were levelled against more than 35,000 people after a BBC Panorama documentary that showed widespread cheating in some Home Office-approved test centres. Ramadan said: “I was so shocked by what I heard. People’s lives had been turned upside down, they were being treated like criminals, they lost friends, some were disowned by their families. Their parents thought the British legal system doesn’t lie – that if you have been accused, then that must be right. It was a nightmare for them.” The charity’s work successfully linked students with lawyers who began to appeal against the allegations; so far more than 3,700 have won their appeals. Ramadan has sought the advice of a film director, who has previously shown an interest in the charity’s work, but is hoping that drama commissioners will see the potential for a powerful story within the battles students are still fighting against the government. “This is not fiction, it’s real, an ongoing story of a live injustice. That’s what so compelling about it,” she said. Patrick Lewis, a barrister with Garden Court chambers, has met many of the students involved. “The parallels with the Post Office scandal are tragically all too obvious,” he said. “I have represented in over 80 cases where individuals have faced removal from the UK based on the accusation of fraud. I have been successful in the vast majority of those appeals as there is evidence which raises real doubts about the reliability of the accusations that have been made.” Navjot Kaur, 33, is one of the students involved in preliminary conversations over how to convert their experiences into drama. She came to Britain from Amritsar, India, to study tourism management when she was 19. “I had no need to cheat in the English test – I had already scored high marks in a test I’d taken previously. This has ruined my life and my career. I still can’t travel. I wanted to be an air hostess. I can’t complete my dreams,” she said. The ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office brought new attention this year to the Post Office Horizon scandal in which people were prosecuted for theft, fraud and false accounting because of faulty accounting software installed in the late 1990s."

The Conservatives are defending majorities of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough in Northants and 11,000 in Kingswood in South Gloucestershire. But Labour is expected to win both contests. The party has pulled off a string of byelection victories, gaining four Tory seats in a row since July. The byelection in Wellingborough was called after Peter Bone was successfully recalled by voters in the constituency in December. The parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. The panel upheld an earlier report that found he had repeatedly hit and verbally abused a member of his staff, asked him for massages and on one occasion put his bare genitals in the other man’s face. Bone’s partner, Helen Harrison, was selected as the Conservative candidate for the byelection. In Kingswood, a byelection was called after Chris Skidmore, a leading Tory voice on green issues, resigned in protest against the government’s bill to allow new oil and gas licences to be issued.   Related: ‘Anyone but Peter Bone’: voters turn to Labour and Reform UK as Wellingborough byelection nears   The byelections come at a testing time for both main parties. Keir Starmer has had one of his most challenging weeks since becoming leader after two parliamentary candidates were suspended over comments relating to Israel. On Wednesday, a Savanta poll saw Labour’s lead over the Conservatives fall by seven points to its lowest level since June. Sunak came under fire last week for agreeing to a £1,000 bet – later rowed back on – with Piers Morgan on whether deportation flights to Rwanda will take off before the general election. He then drew widespread condemnation for deriding Labour’s policy on transgender rights at PMQs after being told that the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery. The selection of Harrison as the Conservative candidate in Wellingborough has been a source of controversy. High-profile Tory MPs have been absent in the constituency and not a single frontbencher has endorsed Harrison. Last month, Sunak dodged the opportunity to endorse her after he was asked whether he was “proud” she was selected, given her connection to Bone. He said that it was up to local members to choose a candidate. The Sunday Times reported that Bone had threatened to stand as an independent if the Tories did not include Harrison on their shortlist of candidates. Bone denied the report but said it would be “entirely unsurprising” if Harrison was selected. Both Labour byelection candidates are former London councillors. Gen Kitchen, running in Wellingborough, grew up in Northamptonshire and she went on to be a councillor in Newham, east London. Damien Egan, the candidate in Kingswood, grew up in the constituency. He resigned as the mayor of Lewisham in south-east London last month. The Tory candidate in Kingswood, Sam Bromiley, leads the party’s group on South Gloucestershire council. Bromiley said his experience as a youth worker would help him tackle crime among young people, promised to stop the Labour-led local council from “hacking into the greenbelt” and said he would work to regenerate the high street. A win for Labour would temper fears that a tough week for the party has significantly threatened its electoral prospects. A win for the Conservatives could give Sunak a lifeline and stave off any long-shot attempts by backbenchers on the right of the party to replace him before the general election."

On Hitler, Cameron added: “He came back for more, costing us far more lives to stop his aggression. “I do not want us to show the weakness displayed against Putin in 2008, when he invaded Georgia, or the uncertainty of the response in 2014, when he took Crimea and much of the Donbas – before coming back to cost us far more with his aggression in 2022. “I want us to show the strength displayed since 2022, as the west has helped Ukrainians liberate half the territory seized by Putin, all without the loss of any Nato service personnel.” The foreign secretary made a similar intervention last December, when he warned during a visit to Washington DC that blocking a package of support for Ukraine would be a “Christmas present” for Putin. Cameron denied claims that he was “interfering” with US politics, saying he had come “as a friend of America” to argue that voting through the funding is “the right thing to do”. The aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan has passed through the Senate 70-29, despite a group of Republicans opposed to $60bn (£47.5bn) for Kyiv arguing that the US should focus on its own problems before sending more money overseas. Ukrainian attacks on Russian aircraft and ships in the Black Sea have helped push Moscow’s naval forces back from the coast. On Wednesday, Kyiv claimed to have severely damaged and sunk a Russian landing ship in its latest drone attack on Moscow’s Black Sea fleet."

        "content": "Social media is trawled, past comments examined and interviews undertaken, as political party candidates submit themselves to an intense vetting process that has only tightened in recent years. However, the case of Azhar Ali, the candidate Labour selected in Rochdale, once again underlines the difficulty of choosing parliamentary hopefuls who will be able to withstand the scrutiny of political life. Ali originally had the support of many in the Labour Jewish community, who regarded him as an ally before his comments emerged that suggested Israel “allowed” the 7 October attacks to happen and “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were fuelling criticism of a pro-Palestinian Labour MP. Senior Labour figures say it was impossible to have known that Ali would circulate such conspiracy theories, having made publicly very different pronouncements. It is understood there were no “flags” about Ali from the vetting process or conversations with those who knew him well. Likewise, Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn, who was ditched for referring to “fucking Israel” in the same meeting as Ali, had been an MP previously for many years before being caught out with the comments on tape. However, the pressure is now mounting on Labour to overhaul its vetting process to avoid the type of protracted row that has engulfed the party over the last three days – and the damage done to recovering relations with the Jewish community. Mike Katz, of the Jewish Labour Movement, suggested that improvements to due diligence could specifically cover the rise in conspiracy theories and inflammatory views that have sprung up since the 7 October attacks and subsequent war in Gaza. Louise Ellman, the former Labour MP and vice-president of the Jewish Leadership Council, also argued that there “clearly hasn’t been proper scrutiny in selecting candidates”, and urged the party to be more careful in future. The Conservatives are reported to have undertaken stricter scrutiny this time – opting for American-style psychometric testing and more stringent background checks in order to avoid the scandals that beset the party with the 2019 intake after many candidates unexpectedly won. In light of the recent furore in Rochdale, Labour will undoubtedly be looking even more closely at what candidates are saying – especially on Israel and Gaza – in order to avoid a string of damaging controversies in the run up to the election. However, improving the vetting process is almost always a shorthand for more control by central parties over the selection of candidates, which brings its own problems in terms of democratic choice. Local party members have a key role in choosing their next parliamentary hopeful from shortlists in both the Conservatives and Labour. There are frequently accusations of “stitch-ups” by party headquarters or powerful local factions. Labour in particular is often accused of being too heavy-handed in the way it shortlists candidates and ensures its favoured choices are on the ballot paper. Extra vetting can go so far in weeding out unsuitable candidates but widening the selection pool to attract better quality parliamentary hopefuls could go even further.  In her 2018 book, Why We Get the Wrong Politicians, Isabel Hardman argued that MPs are drawn from too narrow a section of society because the costs are prohibitive and the drawbacks of the abuse and pressure suffered by MPs attracts a certain kind of person. In 2022, she wrote: “We are still getting the wrong politicians, and the ones we have are in many cases actively making things worse.” It is hard to argue things have changed since then."

        "content": "Keir Starmer is facing a fresh test of his authority as MPs prepare to vote on a second parliamentary motion calling for an “immediate” ceasefire in Gaza next week. The Labour leader and his officials will spend the next few days deciding how to handle an SNP motion on the Middle East crisis, after the party’s abstention on a similar vote in November triggered a huge split in the party and 10 frontbench resignations. The vote is likely to put further pressure on Starmer, who is already under fire over his handling of two Labour candidates who were recorded making derogatory remarks about Israel.   Related: Keir Starmer faces Labour rebellion over Gaza ceasefire vote   Some in Labour have been infuriated by Starmer dragging his feet over calling for a ceasefire. The Labour leader initially called for a “humanitarian pause” and has now shifted to backing a “sustainable ceasefire”, while stopping just short of saying this should be immediate. More than 28,000 Palestinians are thought to have been killed since Israel started its military action in Gaza, with Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to press ahead with a ground offensive in Rafah where more than 1 million refugees are sheltering. When the motion came to a vote last year, Starmer suffered his biggest rebellion as leader, with 56 MPs voting for the SNP motion, including eight shadow ministers, while Labour abstained. “This is going to reopen all those wounds which we thought we had got past,” said one Labour MP about next week’s vote. Another senior Labour MP said they “cannot imagine” that the leadership could ask its MPs to abstain on a ceasefire vote now that its position has substantially shifted. The Labour leader tweeted last week: “The fighting must stop now. We need a sustainable ceasefire.” Since he called for an end to fighting “now”, it is possible the Labour leadership could move towards not disciplining those who vote for the SNP motion or even collectively vote in favour of an “immediate” ceasefire. Many backbenchers are already preparing to vote with the SNP. Labour’s chief whip, Alan Campbell, is understood to have reminded one leftwinger last month that voting with the SNP was not allowed – in what was interpreted as a veiled warning not to defy the leadership over a second ceasefire vote. However, the climate has shifted since then, with one party official saying it would be “madness” to impose heavy discipline on a ceasefire vote. Stephen Flynn, the SNP Westminster leader, called on both Starmer and Rishi Sunak to back an immediate ceasefire, saying “the time for equivocating is over”. “Over 28,000 Palestinian children and civilians have already been killed – and vast swathes of Gaza have been obliterated, including hospitals and family homes,” he said. “The UK parliament cannot just sit on its hands and do nothing. International pressure is paramount if an immediate ceasefire is to happen – and the UK has a moral duty to do its part.“With every day Sunak and Starmer equivocate more children are killed. Enough is enough. This has to end – and it has to end now.” A senior Labour party source said no decisions have been made yet on how the vote will be whipped. The pressure on Starmer comes as he is already under fire for his handling of the revelations surrounding two Labour candidates in the north-west – Rochdale candidate Azhar Ali and Hyndburn candidate Graham Jones – who have both been suspended in recent days for making derogatory remarks about Israel at a meeting in Lancashire. Ali made comments suggesting Israel “allowed” the 7 October attacks and that “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were fuelling criticism of a pro-Palestinian Labour MP, while Jones criticised “fucking Israel”. The Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) on Wednesday called for the suspension of other councillors or candidates in attendance if they failed to call out the remarks by Ali and Jones. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, defended the party’s handling of the row, saying it had responded to unacceptable comments. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today’s programme: “We will follow the hard evidence that’s presented to us or that comes to light. Anyone at that meeting, if there is evidence that people acted or spoke in a way that doesn’t meet the standards, or is incompatible with the values of our Labour party, they need to report it and the Labour party will take it seriously and investigate.”   Related: Azhar Ali row: how Keir Starmer has handled other members’ behaviour   But many in the party believe Starmer should have acted faster over the weekend to suspend Ali, and have warned that his deliberative form of decision making could be harming the party. The Labour leader reportedly took five hours to decide to suspend Ali on Monday, well after he found out about a second set of remarks made by the candidate for Rochdale. “We should have acted straight away, that was completely obvious,” said one senior official. “The only silver lining is that hopefully we’re learning these lessons now, not in the middle of an election campaign.” John Mann, the former Labour MP, peer and government adviser on antisemitism, said Labour did not have an institutional problem with antisemitism, but had been slow to act when confronted with individual allegations. “The rule of thumb on allegations like this is to move quickly,” he said. “They have a life of their own, and they can be damaging beyond the issue itself.” Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock this week said Starmer had lacked “savvy” in his handling of recent crises, including ditching the green spending pledge and the comments made by the party’s Rochdale byelection candidate. Many Labour figures are now worried about a poll by Savanta on Wednesday showing a slump in Labour’s lead from 19 points to 12. The fieldwork for that poll was conducted just after Starmer formally announced he was scaling back the party’s promise to spend £28bn a year on green investments. “This is all completely depressing,” said one Labour figure, referring to the slew of negative headlines in recent weeks."

        "content": "It’s a fact that many of our parents will have said “fucking Germany” after reading about the horrific activities of the Nazis in the 1930s, just as many older readers, like me, will have used the same expletive to describe America after seeing awful photos of napalmed children in Vietnam. In neither case was racism implied, and neither should it be in the case of Graham Jones (Labour suspends second parliamentary candidate over Israel comments, 13 February). In saying “I’m sure when [world leaders] go home, like me, pardon my French [they say] ‘fucking Israel’ again”, Jones was clearly showing his frustration with Israel’s government, an emotion probably felt by many after watching the appalling destruction of Gaza on television, and hearing about Israel’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire. It is simply as much a natural reaction to feel anger, and voice it with expletives, on hearing the story of the six-year-old killed in her family car after it “came under fire from Israeli tanks” (Cousin of Hind Rajab, 6, haunted by her last call after family car shot at in Gaza, 11 February), as it is to show elation on seeing people rescued after being buried by an earthquake. As your editorial states (13 February), Keir Starmer’s desire to escape “his predecessor’s shadow” is one thing, but to pursue it “at all costs” is mistaken. The definition of antisemitism needs immediate clarification from Labour’s leadership; it should not include criticism of the way Benjamin Netanyahu is waging this war. What will almost certainly happen if Starmer doesn’t do this is that the Daily Mail and its ilk will find plenty more evidence over the coming months to embarrass Labour. This is just the start. Bernie EvansLiverpool • The conspiracy theory that the Israeli government deliberately allowed the Hamas assault of 7 October last year, like many conspiracy theories, has evident antisemitic undertones. Azhar Ali has been roundly condemned for propagating it, and is no longer a Labour candidate (Labour withdraws support for Rochdale candidate after Israel-Gaza remarks, 12 February).  A poster produced by the Labour party last April, accusing Rishi Sunak of leniency towards paedophile offenders, had evident racist undertones. The poster was condemned by many Labour members, but defended by some Labour frontbenchers. Labour is now in a state of total disarray in the Rochdale byelection. It is in danger of losing a presumed safe seat, and Rochdale may not be the last. Keir Starmer should ask himself whether his intransigent refusal to condemn, or even to question, extreme and unlawful Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians helps either Labour’s electoral fortunes or his goal of ridding the party of antisemitism.Chris SinhaCringleford, Norfolk • Labour’s support for Azhar Ali, crumbling only when it became completely untenable, demonstrates how accusations of antisemitism are handled differently for the right and the left of the party. With racism on the rise again across Europe, there are very real dangers in how such claims are used for party-factional fighting. The time is long overdue for Labour to take the recommendations of the Forde report seriously.Mike SheaffPlymouth • Have I missed something? The US president said over the weekend that Israel is killing too many innocent people in Gaza. Then he signed legislation giving Israel billions of dollars of arms with which to kill people. No wonder Josep Borrell is confused (‘Provide less arms’ if you think death toll is too high, Josep Borrell tells Israel allies, 12 February).  The leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties should surely be pointing out the logical contradiction rather than continuing to support the killing spree.Guy StandingGeneva, Switzerland"

        "content": "  4.28pm GMT  End of day summary …  We will shortly be wrapping up today’s live blog. Here are the headlines …  Keir Starmer is under pressure to suspend councillors who attended a meeting in Hyndburn over claims that they failed to call out antisemitic remarks by Azhar Ali, the former Labour candidate for the Rochdale byelection. On Tuesday, Labour suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn in Lancashire, less than 24 hours after the party withdrew its support from Ali. Former Conservative home secretary and chancellor Kenneth Clarke has told the House of Lords that Rishi Sunak’s government is setting an “extremely dangerous precedent” and he hopes the Rwanda bill will be struck down as unconstitutional. The Lords were debating a series of proposed amendments. John Randall, former Conservative minister, warned his party “not be so dogmatic that we haven’t got an inch of humanity”. Baroness Butler-Sloss told peers victims of modern slavery and human trafficking should be protected from removal to Rwanda The UK’s annual inflation rate unexpectedly held steady at 4% in January despite rising energy bills adding to the pressure on households, raising the chances of a cut in interest rates sooner than anticipated. Offering consumers some respite amid the cost of living crisis, the latest figures showed food and non-alcoholic drink prices fell at a monthly rate of 0.4% in January – the first monthly decline since May 2021. The governor of the Bank of England has said the UK economy is beginning to pick up. Sunak has told the media today that he absolutely believes “the economy has turned the corner” while convening the first meeting of his 2024 Business Council. The average UK house price fell by around £4,000 in the 12 months to December 2023, according to official figures, although the change was unevenly distributed among the nations. The private rental market saw large cost increases for tenants. The ONS said private rental prices paid by tenants in the UK rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to January 2024. Train drivers at five rail operators have voted to continue taking strike action for another six months. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef said “Our members have voted, time and again, for strikes. That’s why Mark Harper, the transport secretary, is being disingenuous when he says that offer should have been put to members.” The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) regulator has launched an investigation into the performance of National Highways in England. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has endorsed Vaughan Gething as his choice for Labour leader in Wales. Voters will go to the polls tomorrow in the Kingswood and Wellingborough byelections, with Labour hoping to gain two seats from the Conservatives.  Thank you so much for sticking with the blog today and for your comments. I do try and read them all and often find them helpful – especially if you have spotted some ambiguous wording or typos. I will be with you again tomorrow from 9am-ish, when there will be byelections on, and so by law I will have to be on my best behaviour.     4.07pm GMT   Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has written for the Mirror today to endorse Vaughan Gething as his choice for Labour leader in Wales. Noting Gething’s previous role as health minister, Kinnock says:  He was tested under the spotlight of our biggest public health emergency for a century and the biggest crisis Britain has experienced since the second world war. Vaughan’s qualities and values stem from his democratic socialism, his long history of trade unionism and his strong character.  Painting the next general election as “a real opportunity to finally oust the Tories after 14, long, painful years”, Kinnock goes on to say “Vaughan is the right candidate to spearhead that fight in Wales and help Keir Starmer become prime minister.”  Gething is standing against Jeremy Miles to succeed Mark Drakeford as first minister of Wales and Labour leader in the country.     3.51pm GMT   The finance committee of the Northern Ireland assembly is meeting in Stormont, amid some rows about the deal presented by the UK government for funding which requires Northern Ireland to raise its own additional revenue. The SDLP’s Matthew O’Toole is chair of the newly reconstituted committee, and his party have said the key questions are:  What has been agreed with the British government on revenue raising and what will it cost families? Where is the plan to rescue public services? When will public sector workers get a pay rise?   The first Finance Committee session is underway.

He told peers during a second day of committee debate about proposed amendments to the bill:  I continue to be completely flabbergasted by the constitutional implications of a government acting in this way. I would ask the minister whether he has been able to find any precedent for this occurring, has any government in a similar situation ever decided to reverse any legal defeat by just passing legislation saying the facts are what we say they are, not the facts that the supreme court has found on the evidence? I think it’s unlikely. For that reason, I think it’s an extremely dangerous precedent. I very much hope that there will be a legal challenge which will enable the supreme court to strike it down as unconstitutional in due course, but the better step would be for parliament not to pass the legislation in the first place.   Updated at 3.45pm GMT    3.32pm GMT  Governor of Bank of England: signs of 'beginning of a pick-up' in the economy.  The governor of the Bank of England has said the UK economy is beginning to pick up. Speaking to the House of Lords economic affairs committee, PA Media reports Andrew Bailey told peers:  We will find out whether we had a so-called technical recession or not, depending on what the fourth quarter number is. In our February monetary policy report it was in the balance – we didn’t have a recession in the forecast, but it is at best flat, in the view we took. It wouldn’t take much to tip it either way, frankly. Going forward, and I think this is in some ways more significant, we are now seeing some signs of the beginning of a pick-up in some of the surveys, for instance … we’ve got a modest pick-up this year which continues thereafter.  A “technical recession” is when there are two quarters of consecutive negative growth in GDP, however some economists and statisticians argue the term is effectively meaningless, since growth by 0.1% or shrinking by 0.1% are virtually indistinguishable from flat-lining.  Earlier today prime minister Rishi Sunak told business leaders “I absolutely believe that the economy has turned the corner and we’re now pointing in the right direction.” [See 10.27am GMT]     3.11pm GMT   Local journalist Kate Cronin from the Northamptonshire Telegraph appeared on BBC Radio Northampton this morning to talk about the campaign in Wellingborough. She made the point that with the recall of Peter Bone, the campaign had effectively been running since October and local journalists were “really glad to be on the home straight now”. Cronin said it felt like the “eyes of the country” have been on Wellingborough, with a stream of visits to Labour candidate Gen Kitchen – “I think she’s had pretty much one MP visit every day” – and “the Reform candidate has had loads and loads of visitors” including Kate Hoey. Cronin said that the Conservatives hadn’t had as many high profile visits – Rishi Sunak hasn’t been, unlike Keir Starmer – but that the Tories had “loads and loads of grassroots campaigners on the ground, trying to make up for that.” She said that some of the local population had found it a little overwhelming, telling the BBC:  I think it’s been quite a lot for them. I know people who’ve been sort of venturing into the town centre, a bit tired of being accosted by a national newspaper journalist to ask him how they’re going to vote. But I think people ultimately are quite enjoying it because there’s just been so much coverage, and it’s often nice to have that focus on your area. So you can really shout about the things that you think are right or wrong.  Cronin felt it had been beneficial for the area, saying “it’s been really nice to … sort of shout about how great our area is, because I don’t think a lot of people know a lot about Northamptonshire, and we’re not that great about standing up and you know, telling people about how wonderful it is to live here and work here.” She also gave a little bit of insight into what it is like covering the campaign, saying:  It’s going to be a nightmare for all of us, four of us from the Northants Telegraph are going to be covering the count. We’ve all got young children, it’s half term this week. So we’re going to be there from about nine o’clock tomorrow night. All night. We are praying there’s no recount. And then we’ve all got to work on Friday. So I’m going to court on Friday, I’ve got a really big case to cover on Friday and then I’m going back up to my family on Saturday to see Preston North End beat Blackburn Rovers at Deepdale.  And for your info, on Friday we will have an early live blog with me to cover the reaction to the results, which we are expecting about 4am. I will be here from about 7am.     2.43pm GMT   It became clear over the last couple of days that if I ever get the opportunity to include a picture of a ship in a live blog, I will. On Monday it was Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales actually setting sail from Portsmouth, and on Tuesday it was the Glen Sannox ferry on its first sea trials in Glasgow. It turns out this is also true if I get the opportunity to post a picture of a giant tortoise, because the St Helena government has issued a photograph of speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle meeting Jonathan the tortoise, who is believed to be the oldest tortoise ever recorded. And the photo is so good I thought you would all enjoy it. PA Media reports Hoyle used the parliamentary recess to visit the south Atlantic island and UK overseas territory. Jonathan is thought to have hatched in 1832. Hoyle is quoted as saying “As a massive animal lover, and owner of a three-stone tortoise, I have been really looking forward to meeting Jonathan and giving him the Guinness World Record for being the oldest recorded tortoise.” While on St Helena the speaker also met with governor Nigel Phillips.     2.25pm GMT   I had some coverage of the Kingswood byelection campaign earlier [See 13.35 GMT]. Wellingborough is the other constituency where people will be going to the polls tomorrow. For the FT Lucy Fisher has visited the constituency, and writes:  Only a clutch of Conservative front- or backbenchers have appeared on the campaign trail, and even fewer have advertised their presence on social media. The Conservatives’ “air war” has also been quieter: the party’s candidate Helen Harrison last posted on X on January 11, and national media requests to interview her have been rejected. Reform UK insiders believe they will be boosted by the “low visibility” Conservative campaign, as they hope to clinch at least 10 per cent of the vote on Thursday. Ben Habib, its candidate in Wellingborough, said Labour and the Tories were viewed as “shades of grey” among locals. He said he had been buoyed by “lots of waves and lots of tooting of horns” when driving the party’s battle bus around the constituency. Scott Miller, 54, the owner of a barbershop in Rushden, [said]. “My whole life I’ve voted Conservative, but I’m afraid this time for the by-election, I’m voting Reform,” he said, accusing Sunak of being “spineless”. He was among several local voters who said they had become interested in the party after watching right-leaning broadcaster GB News.  ITV News Anglia have managed to get some rare words out of the Conservative candidate Harrison. Her partner Peter Bone has been campaigning alongside her, despite the fact that the byelection is happening after he was recalled from parliament by constituents in disgrace. Harrison told ITV:  When I’m out on the doorstep with Peter … we get a really warm reception. But people know that I’m a different person as well. Peter and I have campaigned on so many things together, but I’m Helen Harrison. I’m a local person, I come from a health background, all my life I’ve given to helping other people so I bring a different perspective and that’s what people are going to get locally.      2.14pm GMT   John Randall, a former Conservative minister, has warned his party “not be so dogmatic that we haven’t got an inch of humanity” over the Rwanda deportation bill. Supporting an amendment in the House of Lords which would add exceptions for people who had served in the British armed forces and then sought refugee status in the UK, he said:  I’ve always been proud of this country, but if we reject looking after those who have put their lives at risk and many have suffered the ultimate sacrifice – if we do not allow them this, then I’m afraid I will not be so proud of this country, I will not be so proud of the party that I’m in. We must show humanity if we can call ourselves British.  Randall is chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation Former diplomat David Hannay added in front of peers that “our honour is at stake” in the way the UK deals with Afghan refugees who have served in the British armed forces or helped them.     1.57pm GMT   Back on the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill debate in the House of Lords for a moment, and Graham Stirrup, former senior Royal Air Force commander and chief of defence staff, has argued in favour of an amendment which would exclude soldiers from foreign countries who have fought for the UK from being deported to Rwanda. He told the unelected second chamber:  If global Britain is to be effective in the world, it will need to form partnerships with and gain support from people in all sorts of different parts of that world, often in very difficult and dangerous parts of that world. In order to garner such support, it will need to be seen as trustworthy. How trustworthy does anybody think we will be seen if we have taken those who have already served us so faithfully in such difficult circumstances and sent them to Rwanda? So for those who are not swayed by a sense of moral obligation, I ask you to consider the future effectiveness and safety of the men and women of our armed forces who are sent out to do such difficult and dangerous things in these parts of the world.      1.35pm GMT   If you are interested in some local voices from the Kingswood constituency, which has a byelection tomorrow, then the Bristol Cable yesterday published this short 16 minute podcast where they spoke to people in the area, particularly around the high street, including one resident who said:  It’s a bit of a dump, and it’s got worse. It’s all charity shops. There’s the supermarket but that’s it. It’s rubbish. There needs to be something to bring people in … more interesting than sandwich shops and takeaways. They’re supposed to be rebuilding the entire centre. They keep talking about it and never doing it.  Local business owner Tony Tardio said:  The footfall isn’t as great as it used to be. When I first started, there used to be a market next door … and on a Thursday and Saturday the place would be heaving – the car park would be full. I’m still open, but I’m doing half of what I was doing about 12 years ago. It’s a throwaway society, so for me personally, I don’t think the good old days will come back. I’ve got to be happy with it, just ticking over and making a moderate living.  In the New Statesman, Anoosh Chakelian has also written a piece about the Kingswood byelection. She writes:  With a no-longer-comfortable Conservative majority of 11,220, it’s a tough seat for any politician to crack. “Speaking to the women [in the constituency], they’re doing exactly the same sort of jobs that my mum did – like shop work, dinner ladies, cleaners, that sort of job, but they are a lot poorer,” Damien Egan [Labour’s candidate] observed. “People are now going to foodbanks.” Also top of voters’ minds are the lack of NHS dental places in the Bristol area, rising mortgage payments, and anti-social behaviour. Shoplifting is on the up, and there has been a spree of stabbings in Bristol.  Chakelian had less luck getting quotes from the Conservative candidate attempting to defend Chris Skidmore’s seat, noting that she “waited outside the constituency HQ, which bore nothing but frosted glass and a small printed A4 ‘closed’ sign. The lights were on but no one answered, and over about an hour there was no sign of the usual coming-and-going of stoic activists in anoraks clutching clipboards.” She writes that “Their candidate, a local called Sam Bromiley, appears to be running a one-issue campaign against South Gloucestershire Council’s plans to build 8,000-odd houses on greenfield land.” Earlier this week the Conservative government announced a series of proposed changes to the planning system to encourage developers to build more homes.     1.14pm GMT   I did promise at the outset of today to avoid shoehorning in Valentine’s day references, left, right and centre-left, but I couldn’t make the promise apply to anybody else. The Conservatives have launched a series of social media posts which they have dubbed the “Starmer Sutra”, attempting to illustrate various positions that the Labour leader has taken.   The Starmer Sutra is the perfect Valentine’s Day gift for the politically promiscuous.Written by the father of u-turns, this is the definitive how-to guide on flip-flopping into different positions on anything.*Only available in paperback and spineless editions* pic.twitter.com/Lb3e1fr07k— Conservatives (@Conservatives) February 14, 2024  Labour, meanwhile, are sending out 17,000 Valentine’s cards in the Kingswood constituency campaigning for Damien Egan.     12.51pm GMT   The government is “undermining” the UK’s modern slavery protections with the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, a Conservative former minister has claimed. John Gummer, a Tory former environment secretary who sits in the House of Lords as Lord Deben, was speaking in favour of a series of amendments to the Bill aimed at ensuring that Rwanda is not conclusively considered a safe country for unaccompanied children, and victims of modern slavery and human trafficking. Lord Deben told peers:  I must say I am a bit tired of having to remind this government of what it means to be a Conservative. I have had to do that earlier on, on the single market, and I am now doing it on this. We have a reputation in the world because of our Modern Slavery Act. It was a brave and important thing to do. It was welcomed across the whole House. I am proud that it was a Conservative government that did this, I am not proud that there is a Conservative government undermining that when we know that more than three quarters of those who appeal in these circumstances are found to be right in their appeal. I think those of us who sit in our comfortable places might just think on Ash Wednesday that this is a moment to reach out to those who are uncomfortable and are not able to speak up for themselves, and there are few people who are in a worse position than these. So on what possible moral basis do you threaten to send them to a country which has not signed up to the international agreement on modern slavery, to a country which has twice as many modern slaves as we do and we admit that we have many whom we have not traced, to a country which has a history of ignoring this problem? How on earth can we defend that on a moral basis, leave alone a practical basis? What the blazes is the use of claiming that there is a deterrent effect when the person you are talking about is not in a position to be deterred because they have been taken up by someone who has made those decisions for them?   Updated at 12.57pm GMT    12.48pm GMT   Victims of modern slavery and human trafficking should be protected from removal to Rwanda, a former top judge has told the government. Baroness Butler-Sloss, the first female Lord Justice of Appeal, argued for this to be added to the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill as peers continued their line-by-line scrutiny on Wednesday. The independent crossbench peer told the House of Lords:   The Modern Slavery Act is an outstanding piece of legislation by, for goodness sake, a Conservative government. We were all extremely proud of it, it was copied in Australia and in other countries. The government asserts, without evidence, that the system of assessing whether a person is a genuine victim is being abused. But the figures from the NRM (National Referral Mechanism) show that the majority of those going through the system are found to be genuine.  Noting that modern slavery protections no longer apply to “those trafficked into this country for exploitation here”, she argued this will have “a devastating effect on victims and also on the United Kingdom’s ability to deal with the perpetrators of this heinous crime”. Butler-Sloss, who is also the vice chairwoman of the Human Trafficking Foundation, urged the government to accept her amendment to show “some support to those who are or are about to be victims of a hugely profitable and odious trade in men, women and children”.     12.46pm GMT   The Guardian’s Steven Morris has interviewed Wales’ economy minister, Vaughan Gething, who is battling to become the leader of Welsh Labour, and thus the first minister of Wales, as well as the country’s first black leader next month. Gething said of his candidacy:  You can’t deny the historic nature of it. I think I should win because I’m the best candidate. I’ve got loads of experience. I’ve got values rooted in our movement. I was a trade union shop steward, Wales TUC president, had 10 years as an employment lawyer and I have a vision for the future. But if I win, the fact that I’ll be the first black leader of any European nation is a matter of historic significance.    Related: ‘You can’t deny the historic nature of it’: Labour’s Vaughan Gething aims to become first black Welsh leader       12.04pm GMT   Elizabeth Butler-Sloss is telling the House of Lords that the UK was rightly proud of legislation it introduced to combat modern slavery, which was copied by other nations, but that Rwanda does not have similar provisions. “The government asserts without evidence” she says, that the modern slavery legislation is being abused.     12.00pm GMT   Home secretary James Cleverly has commented on the safety of MPs, saying he is working with the speaker of the house on the issue. He posted to social media:  The intimidation of MPs is wrong and undemocratic. The speaker and I work with parliamentary security and the police to keep measures for MPs under constant review. MPs shouldn’t have to choose between their family’s safety and representing their community.  The comments come in the wake of a pro-Palestinian demonstration that was held outside the house of Conservative MP and former Middle East minister Tobias Ellwood’s house. Alicia Kearns, chairperson of the foreign affairs select committee, commented:  It is wholly unacceptable for a public servant’s private home to be targeted. This has a chilling effect on political discourse, and serves only to push politicians to the point where they question whether it is all worth it, especially for their families.  Ellwood and his two sons were reported to be at the house at the time of the protest.     11.53am GMT  House of Lords begins second day of debate on Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill  The House of Lords has started to debate amendments to the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill. You can watch it here. Liberal Democrat peer Paul Scriven is opening the debate and said the house is dealing with “a world of fiction and untruths” in the bill. You can read the amendments being debated here.     11.41am GMT   Train drivers at five rail operators have voted to continue taking strike action for another six months. Aslef announced that its members on Chiltern, c2c, East Midlands, Northern and TransPennine railways had overwhelmingly backed carrying on with action. Unions involved in disputes are forced to reballot their members every six months on continuing with industrial action. PA Media reports Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef said:  Our members have voted, time and again, for strikes. That’s why Mark Harper, the transport secretary, is being disingenuous when he says that offer should have been put to members. Drivers obviously wouldn’t vote for industrial action, again and again and again, if they thought that was a good offer. They don’t. That offer was dead in the water in April last year – and I think Mr Harper knows that.      11.38am GMT   Our North of England editor Helen Pidd is on the Today in Focus podcast today, which asks what on earth is going on in the Rochdale byelection? She has been covering the election, and speaking to people in Rochdale about the chaotic political process there. She tells Nosheen Iqbal how voters are feeling and what really matters to them. You can listen to it here …   Related: What on earth is going on in the Rochdale byelection? – podcast       11.32am GMT   The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) regulator has launched an investigation into the performance of National Highways. In a media statement, the regulator said:  Since it was created, National Highways has generally achieved its aims and delivered well for road users. ORR’s annual assessment of National Highways’ performance, published in July 2023, identified a number of potential risks, such as delivery of its capital portfolio and asset management strategy. Since then, ORR has observed that those risks have materialised, and performance has dipped across several areas.  National Highways operates and maintains motorways and major A-roads in England. Feras Alshaker, director of planning and performance at ORR, is quoted as saying “National Highways has generally delivered well for road users, but in recent months we have become concerned that its performance has dipped in a number of areas and issues are recurring.” The regulator says it is planning for the investigation to take approximately eight to 12 weeks between February and April 2024.     11.13am GMT  House of Lords to debate Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill amendments  The House of Lords has begun sitting for the day. There is a live stream here. A bit later on it will be debating the government’s Rwanda deportation Bill again, and in advance there are another 34 pages of potential amendments to the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill. You can read those here. Among the possible changes are clauses which are designed to:  ensure the declaration that Rwanda is a safe country is capable of being rebutted in law by credible evidence. seek to give effect to the proposition that parliament cannot judge Rwanda to be a safe country until the Rwanda treaty has been, and continues to be, fully implemented. ensure that Rwanda is not to be conclusively treated as a safe country where the person to be removed is an unaccompanied child, a victim of human trafficking, or a victim of modern slavery. seeks to ensure that the act does not apply retrospectively.  Among those putting their names to the amendments are Shami Chakrabarti, Brenda Hale, Douglas Hogg and archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.     10.59am GMT   This is not the business live blog – that is with my colleague Jasper Jolly over here – but there is a bit more economic data out from the ONS today which is likely to have ramification for politics and the cost of living crisis. The average UK house price fell by around £4,000 in the 12 months to December 2023, according to official figures, although the change was unevenly distributed among the nations. Property values fell annually by 2.1% in England and by 2.5% in Wales, but house prices increased annually by 3.3% in Scotland and by 1.4% in Northern Ireland. London had the biggest fall in house prices. I think I can predict the Daily Express front page tomorrow. The private rental market saw large cost increases for tenants. The ONS said private rental prices paid by tenants in the UK rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to January 2024. Annual private rental prices increased by 6.1% in England, 7.0% in Wales and 6.8% in Scotland in the 12 months to January 2024. The ONS said Northern Ireland’s data was only available up to November 2023, so it has not been broken out. The 6.8% increase in Scotland is the highest annual rate since the Scotland data started in January 2012. Rents in London increased by 6.9% annually – representing the joint-highest annual percentage change since London records started in January 2006.     10.48am GMT   The headline inflation figures today do mean that the prime minister can claim to have achieved one of his five key pledges, albeit the one where the target for inflation belongs to the independent Bank of England rather than the government per se. Here is a quick ready reckoner on where Rishi Sunak stands with the five key pledges he made in January, which are listed here and highlighted in bold in this list.  “We will halve inflation this year to ease the cost of living and give people financial security”. Sunak needed inflation to fall to below 5.4%, and it has. “We will grow the economy, creating better-paid jobs and opportunity right across the country”. The final GDP figures for the year will be published on Thursday, it looks unlikely that the economy will have grown by much more than 0.5%, and may have shrunk. “We will make sure our national debt is falling so that we can secure the future of public services”. The national debt rose over the course of 2023. It stands at 97.7%, higher than it was a year earlier when it stood at 95.8%. “NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly”. Sunak’s government is only responsible for health in England, as it is a devolved matter. The number of people waiting for NHS treatment reached an estimated 7.61 million in November, up from 7.21 million in January 2023. “We will pass new laws to stop small boats, making sure that if you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed”. 29,437 people crossed the Channel in small boats in 2023 down from 45,755 in 2022. Sunak has failed to pass his Rwanda deportation bill, with the supreme court ruling against it in November.   Updated at 1.59pm GMT    10.27am GMT  Sunak: 'I absolutely believe that the economy has turned the corner'  Rishi Sunak has told the media that he absolutely believes “the economy has turned the corner” while convening the first meeting of his 2024 Business Council. Speaking in Downing Street to chief executives, PA Media reports the prime minister said during the public opening of the meeting:  I’m absolutely determined to make the UK the best place in the world to start to grow and invest in businesses. Of course we’re still battling with lots of global headwinds, not least the Red Sea at the moment, but at the start of this year I absolutely believe that the economy has turned the corner and we’re now pointing in the right direction. Hopefully that’s something that you’re seeing in your businesses, but inflation has been more than halved from 11% down to 4%, mortgage rates are starting to come down. Everyone is predicting us to grow this year.      10.19am GMT   By the way I notice in the comments – see I promised that I do read them – some criticism of the reporting of the inflation figures saying that food prices fell when the headline inflation rate is 4%. While it is true that inflation falling from 11% to 4% doesn’t mean that prices are going down, it means they are going up more slowly, my understanding is that the food price component of the inflation figures did show prices going down, albeit from a high base. From our reporting:  However, food and non-alcoholic drink prices fell at a monthly rate of 0.4% in January, the first monthly decline since May 2021, driven by price cuts in January for bread and cereals, cream crackers, sponge cake and chocolate biscuits. Against a backdrop of a tough Christmas for UK retailers because of weak consumer spending, furniture prices also fell at the fastest monthly rate in four years amid steep reductions for kitchens, leather settees, dining tables and chairs.  There is a breakdown chart here:  #Inflation held down by a further fall in #food price inflation and weakness in 'furniture and household goods' and 'clothing and footwear' - consistent with the idea that December's slump in #retail sales has prompted some heavier discounting... pic.twitter.com/OFFAQYNwsF— Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) February 14, 2024  Whether any of that actually translates to people feeling they are better off or that their supermarket shop has got cheaper remains to be seen, as the ONS notes:  The ONS said that although food inflation fell on the month in January, prices had increased by 25% over the past two years – more than double the rate seen over the entire preceding decade.      10.12am GMT   On Tuesday, Labour suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn in Lancashire, who referred to “fucking Israel” and questioned why British citizens were fighting with the Israel Defense Forces in the invasion of Gaza while at the same meeting where Azhar Ali made remarks that led to his suspension. The Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) has called for the suspension of other councillors or candidates in attendance over claims they failed to criticise these remarks. Mike Katz, the chair of JLM, suggested that even attendance at the meeting could be enough to warrant suspension. He said: “To be in that meeting, to have heard that rhetoric, to have been a bystander … whether councillors, whether MPs, they’re there to promote community cohesion.” Asked whether any other councillors or parliamentary candidates who were at the meeting should be suspended, Katz said: “If they’re identifiable, absolutely, we’d say, we’d say that.” It is not known if the remarks by Ali and Jones went unchallenged.

They note that if the Conservatives lose one or both, it would mean the government has clocked up more by-election defeats in a single parliament than any government since the 1960s. The last government to lose this many by-elections during a single parliament was the 1992-97 Conservative administration led by John Major. In Kingswood, Chris Skidmore had won the Gloucestershire constituency for the Conservatives at the past four general elections, increasing his share of the vote on each occasion. In January Skidmore resigned over Rishi Sunak’s environmental policies and plans for new oil and gas licences, saying “I can also no longer condone nor continue to support a government that is committed to a course of action that I know is wrong and will cause future harm. To fail to act, rather than merely speak out, is to tolerate a status quo that cannot be sustained.” Before 2010, Labour had won the seat at every general election since 1992. To win Labour needs a swing of 11.4%, much smaller than ones achieved in its recent by-election successes against the Tories. The Northamptonshire constituency of Wellingborough was won by disgraced former MP Peter Bone for the Conservatives at every general election from 2005 to 2019. In October he was suspended from parliament for six weeks after a watchdog found he had harassed and bullied a staff member and exposed his genitals near their face. In an interview with the BBC at the time, the unnamed alleged victim claimed that “the physical, emotional and psychological abuse” he suffered at the hands of Bone had left him a “broken shell of the young man I once was”. Bone has denied the allegations, but was subject to a recall petition which has forced the byelection. His partner is standing for the Conservatives. Labour came second in four of the five contests, the exception being 2015 when Ukip was runner-up. Further back, Labour won Wellingborough at the 1997 and 2001 general elections. The swing needed by Labour to win the seat is larger than in Kingswood, at 17.9%. Polls open at 7am tomorrow, and will close at 10pm. The results are anticipated to be declared in both constituencies some time after 4am. Due to new laws introduced by the Conservative government, voters will need to bring an accepted form of photo ID with them. An interim study by the Electoral Commission warned after last year’s local elections of “concerning” signs that voters with disabilities, people who are unemployed, or those from particular ethnic groups could be disproportionately affected by the policy. About 14,000 people were turned away from polling stations at May’s local elections because they lacked the right ID.     9.40am GMT   Somewhat inevitably, given the coverage over the last couple of days, shadow defence secretary John Healey’s media round this morning was dominated by questions about Labour’s selection and disciplinary processes in the wake of the suspension of two candidates – Azhar Ali and Graham Jones. Addressing the questions of whether there were flaws in Labour’s vetting process, Healy said on the BBC:  Azhar Ali was widely respected, widely supported across communities, including the Jewish community in the North West, and there certainly are strong checks, the due diligence process as part of selecting Labour candidates. But you can’t see everything everywhere. What’s important is that if new information comes to light, as in this case, we will act to investigate, we will act to block those who are not fit to serve as MPs.  He told Sky News that the Labour party was not a “party of people who are saints”. He said:  Restoring, retaining the trust of the Jewish community and any community is a constant process. And Keir Starmer is deeply, deeply aware of that. He pledged to root out antisemitism as part of the changes he wanted to make to Labour, regarded them as essential. He’s done that. But this is not a party of people who are saints. When people do things that may be wrong, say things that may be unacceptable, the important thing is how does the party respond. We have an independent investigations process and when it concerns candidates or MPs, we expect as the public does the very highest standards.  He also told Sky News viewers:  Why Graham Jones has been suspended is not just for being at the meeting. But what’s come to light are unacceptable comments that he made that were plain wrong. So he was suspended and then interviewed. And if the party decides, Keir Starmer decides, that he too is not meeting the highest standards that the public have a right to expect and Keir Starmer insist on in our candidates … then he will be replaced.  If you missed it, overnight my colleagues Aletha Adu and Eleni Courea have written an analysis piece about the meeting of councillors in the north-west of England that has resulted in the two suspensions:   Related: The grassroots Labour meeting at centre of party turmoil       9.17am GMT   My colleague Phillip Inman has this analysis on this morning’s inflation figures: Good news came from the food industry, where inflation fell from December to January, but the annual rate remains high at 7% and food and non-alcoholic beverage prices are about 25% higher than they were two years ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Worse is the price of electricity, gas, and other fuels. Inflation for this category has fallen by 18% since its peak in January 2023. However, prices last month were 89% higher than they were in January 2021. These are dramatic increases in the cost of living. So it is no wonder the boss of the TUC, Paul Nowak, is hopping mad about any talk of lower inflation somehow meaning the problem has gone away for most people. At the Bank of England, policymakers will be concerned that strong wage increases are flowing into higher prices and that its job of taming inflation is not yet done. The hotel and restaurant trade seems to show that trend in action. However, low-paid workers are being helped by the national minimum wage, which employers know is going up by almost 10% in April, to £11.44 an hour. Like the energy price cap, this is a government initiative that the Bank cannot do anything about.

She said:  After 14 years of economic failure working people are worse off. Prices are still rising in the shops, with the average household’s costs up £110-a-week compared to before the last election. Inflation is still higher than the Bank of England’s target and millions of families are struggling with the cost of living. The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken. It’s time for change. Only Labour has a long-term plan to get Britain’s future back by delivering more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills.  The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said:  Inflation never falls in a perfect straight line, but the plan is working; we have made huge progress in bringing inflation down from 11%, and the Bank of England forecast that it will fall to around 2% in a matter of months.  Inflation was at 11% in November 2022, its highest rate since October 1981, just after Rishi Sunak took office as prime minister.     8.59am GMT  UK inflation remains unchanged at 4% as food prices fall  Richard Partington and Larry Elliott report: Britain’s annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 4% in January despite an increase in energy bills as the cost of living crisis persisted. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed inflation as measured by the consumer prices index defying predictions of an increase in January, after the first monthly fall in food prices for more than two years offset the rise in gas and electricity costs. The Bank of England had predicted a small rise in inflation last month after an increase in the Ofgem energy price cap for households across Great Britain, while economists polled by Reuters expected an increase to 4.2%. Last month’s better-than-predicted news on the cost of living is likely to be followed by a fall in inflation to the government’s 2% target in the spring. Inflation was last at 2% in July 2021 and rose to a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 before starting to decline.

Here is a quick reminder of what is going on there … Wellingborough has a byelection after veteran Conservative MP Peter Bone was subject to a recall petition after a watchdog found he had bullied a staff member and exposed his genitals near their face, which Bone has denied. The Conservatives have selected his partner Helen Harrison to defend the seat, which has not gone down well with locals. Bone won in 2019 with a majority of 18,540. Gen Kitchen is the Labour candidate and Keir Starmer was in the constituency with her yesterday. Ana Gunn is standing for the Liberal Democrats and Will Morris standing for the Green party. The co-deputy leader of Reform UK, Ben Habib is their candidate. Labour overturned even bigger Conservative majorities in October 2023 byelections in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire, leading to some expectation resting on Kitchen that she will win.

Sam Bromiley is defending Skidmore’s 11,220 majority from 2019. Labour have selected Damien Egan in a seat which has swung between the Tories and Labour over the last century. The Green party came fourth in Kingswood in 2019 but since then has become the largest group on Bristol city council, and has Lorraine Francis standing for it. Andrew Brown is standing for the Liberal Democrats. Reform UK and Ukip also have candidates, with Rupert Lowe, former chairman of Rishi Sunak’s beloved Southampton MP, standing for Richard Tice’s party.

This time tomorrow polls will be open in the Wellingborough and the Kingswood byelections, which were expected to be a big test of whether Rishi Sunak would retain a grip on his leadership of the Tory party if results went against the prime minister. Instead they are likely to be viewed almost entirely through the prism of Labour in the wake of the suspension of two parliamentary candidates in two days. Here are the headlines …  A second Labour parliamentary candidate was suspended yesterday over comments made about Israel in a private meeting of Labour activists. It is understood that the party has suspended Graham Jones, its candidate for Hyndburn. Jones is the second Labour parliamentary candidate to be suspended in less than 24 hours over comments made during the meeting, following the decision by Keir Starmer to withdraw support from Azhar Ali, the party’s candidate in Rochdale. Britain’s annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 4% in January despite an increase in energy bills as the cost of living crisis persisted. The first monthly fall in food prices for more than two years offset the rise in gas and electricity costs. The Bank of England’s target is 2%. We can expect words from Rishi Sunak on this later. The Northern Ireland budget settlement will be discussed in Stormont, with the permanent secretary of the department of finance to appear before the newly reconstituted assembly’s finance committee. Hundreds of frontline NHS staff are treating patients despite being under investigation for their part in an alleged “industrial-scale” qualifications fraud. More than 700 nurses are caught up in a potential scandal, which a former head of the Royal College of Nursing said could put NHS patients at risk. The UK’s hostile environment policies had a worse effect on the mental health of black Caribbean people than the coronavirus lockdown had on the wider population, researchers have found.  The Commons is in recess. The Lords is sitting from 11am and Rwanda is on the agenda later in the day. The Senedd and the Scottish parliament are not sitting. Stormont has a finance committee meeting. It is Martin Belam here with you again today, desperately trying to avoid shoehorning Valentine’s day references into the blog non-stop. I do try to read and dip into the comments when I can, but if you want to get my attention the best way is to email me – martin.belam@theguardian.com – especially if you have spotted an error or typo.

        "content": "Vaughan Gething knows that whenever he discusses his skin colour, he is accused of playing the race card and opens himself up to a torrent of abuse on social media. Nevertheless, he does not fight shy of discussing the significance of what he will achieve if he becomes the leader of Welsh Labour, and thus the first minister of Wales, next month. “You can’t deny the historic nature of it. I think I should win because I’m the best candidate. I’ve got loads of experience. I’ve got values rooted in our movement. I was a trade union shop steward, Wales TUC president, had 10 years as an employment lawyer and I have a vision for the future. But if I win, the fact that I’ll be the first black leader of any European nation is a matter of historic significance.” Gething, who was born to a Welsh father and a Zambian mother, is used to being a trailblazer. In 2013, he became the first black minister in any of the devolved UK administrations, and he remains the only minority ethnic Welsh Labour politician elected in either the Welsh or UK parliaments. “That’s not because other people didn’t want to do it or weren’t capable or determined,” he said. But they didn’t have the opportunity or the breaks. His importance as a role model was highlighted in September last year when he made an emotional visit to Birmingham, Alabama, to represent Wales at the 60th anniversary of the racist bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church in which four black girls died. The people of Wales raised money for a stained glass window depicting a black Christ to be installed as part of the church’s restoration. Gething said that when he got up to speak (having rehearsed for the daunting moment in a Greek Orthodox church in Cardiff), there was an audible gasp. “Even in Birmingham, Alabama, a very black city, they didn’t expect someone who looked like me to stand up from Wales,” he said. As part of his leadership campaign, Gething has pledged to set up the Mari Rees fund, named in honour of a black Welsh Labour candidate for the Senedd elections in 2011. “She died a month before the election. She would have been fantastic. The fund will pay for training and development for black, Asian and minority ethnic members to help them progress within Labour and stand in elections,” he said. “I think our Senedd needs to do more to look like our country.”  🌹 The Mari Rees FundIn 2011, I was due to be elected alongside Mari Rees. Sadly, I remain the only non-white Welsh Labour politician elected in either the Welsh or UK parliaments due to Mari's tragic death.This fund is designed to change that.🔗  https://t.co/In299zPpKK pic.twitter.com/QrrOsmIwOb— Vaughan Gething (@vaughangething) February 8, 2024  Gething was speaking to the Guardian at the Butetown community centre, in a deprived, richly diverse area of Cardiff where he served as a councillor. He said that what he had seen here – child poverty, people living in substandard housing, a lack of role models – had inspired him to strive for high office to try to make a difference. He remembers one woman he had helped to move from overcrowded conditions waiting for him at the end of a surgery to thank him. “That motivates you to want to do more.” Making sure people have a decent place to call home is one of his key pledges and he has said he will prioritise speeding up the planning process for green, social housing. Another key aim is to help children in the first 1,000 days of their lives. “Investing in those early years gives you the biggest return in terms of ambition, aspiration and achievement,” he said. Gething’s first government job, 11 years ago, was as the deputy minister for tackling poverty. He was the health minister during Covid and now holds the economy brief. So hasn’t he had time already to tackle issues such as child poverty? He said the devolved government had been hampered by funding cuts from the UK government but Welsh-only initiatives such as the Flying Start programme, which helps families with children under four in disadvantaged areas, had helped to protect the most needy. “You definitely see the value in what we’ve done. You also see the harm done by choices made in Westminster.” A Labour win at the general election would help hugely, he said. “I’d like to be able to do more with a government that is on our side throughout the UK.” One of the most contentious current issues in Wales is the widespread introduction of 20mph speed limits. Gething admitted that mistakes had been made. “We got some of the messaging and communications wrong. We didn’t take people with us though the change. I want the policy to succeed because I want to know my son’s got less chance of being hit and more chance of getting up if it happens. We need to show we are prepared to listen and not just lecture.” Unlike the current first minister, Mark Drakeford, and Gething’s rival for the top job, Jeremy Miles, Gething is not a Welsh speaker but he is learning. “I think it would be great to have a learner in the first minister’s office. We have this target of reaching a million Welsh speakers. To get to a million we need more people like me, people who are learning, showing the language is really there for all of us, it’s not there to exclude people. It’s something for all of us to be proud of.” Miles has said he would offer Gething a job if he wins and offer to serve under him if he loses. Would Gething do the same? “I’m here to win,” he said. “I’d happily offer Jeremy a job in the government. I’ve got real respect for him. We’ll need all our trade union colleagues and allies to fight together against the Tories. We’ll need a united Senedd group and government to fight for Wales.” "

        "content": "Keir Starmer is under pressure to suspend councillors who attended a meeting in Hyndburn over claims that they failed to call out antisemitic remarks by Azhar Ali, the former Labour candidate for the Rochdale byelection. On Tuesday, Labour suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn in Lancashire, less than 24 hours after the party withdrew its support from Ali over remarks he made at a meeting in Hyndburn when he repeated conspiracy theories about Israel’s attack on Gaza and complained about the influence of “certain Jewish quarters” in the media. At the same meeting, Jones referred to “fucking Israel” and questioned why British citizens were fighting with the Israel Defense Forces in the invasion of Gaza. The Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) has called for the suspension of other councillors or candidates in attendance over claims they failed to criticise these remarks. The call came as it was reported that the Hyndburn councillor and Labour group leader, Munsif Dad, was also at the meeting. It is not known if the remarks by Ali and Jones went unchallenged. The shadow defence secretary, John Healey, when asked on Sky News whether the party would suspend Dad, said: “I don’t know why he was at the meeting.” He said: “This is not a party of people who are saints. When people do things that may be wrong, say things that may be unacceptable, the important thing is how does the party respond. Healey later told BBC Radio 4’s Today’s programme: “We will follow the hard evidence that’s presented to us or that comes to light. Anyone at that meeting, if there is evidence that people acted or spoke in a way that doesn’t meet the standards, or is incompatible with the values of our Labour party, they need to report it and the Labour party will it take it seriously and investigate.” Mike Katz, the chair of JLM, suggested that even attendance at the meeting could be enough to warrant suspension. He said: “To be in that meeting, to have heard that rhetoric, to have been a bystander … whether councillors, whether MPs, they’re there to promote community cohesion.” Asked whether any other councillors or parliamentary candidates who were at the meeting should be suspended, Katz said: “If they’re identifiable, absolutely, we’d say, we’d say that.” Healey paid tribute to the Mail newspapers, which exposed the remarks at the meeting after being passed a recording. He told Sky: “Hats off to the Daily Mail, that’s part of the important public role that journalists have. This was information that we weren’t aware of. We didn’t know about beforehand, when that evidence was presented to the party, and Keir Starmer took a view on this within hours. “He acted very swiftly to do something no Labour leader or no party leader has done before, which was to suspend the campaigning support for our own candidate in the middle of a byelection.” Pressed on whether there were flaws in candidate vetting, Healey told Today: “Azhar Ali was widely respected, widely supported across communities, including the Jewish community in the north-west, and there certainly are strong checks, the due diligence process as part of selecting Labour candidates. “But you can’t see everything everywhere. What’s important is that if new information comes to light, as in this case, we will act to investigate, we will act to block those who are not fit to serve as MPs.”"

        "content": "David Cameron will discuss strengthening Ukraine’s defences and finances against further Russian aggression with European partners in light of the continuing threat of the US Congress refusing to provide further financial support. The foreign secretary is due to visit Bulgaria and Poland before meeting a host of European foreign ministers at a security conference in Munich on Friday. The UK has not abandoned hopes Washington will agree to extra aid, and believes the Biden administration has the leeway to provide some aid regardless of Congress. But Lord Cameron will raise how the European countries, including Poland, can increase defence production and accelerate plans to hand Ukraine the windfall profits from Russian assets seized by Europe. Switching his gaze temporarily from the Middle East, he will visit Bulgaria on Wednesday and the newly elected government in Poland on Thursday in the run-up to the anniversary of the Russian invasion, and a G20 foreign ministers meeting in Brazil next week. There is also expected to be a UN security council meeting in New York and a G7 leaders’ video call. British officials are not expecting military breakthroughs for Ukraine this year but are confident that Ukraine can at least hold its ground and start to rebuild its economy, partly due to increased opportunities for naval grain corridors in the Black Sea to reopen after the Russian fleet was pushed east. Britain is hoping the dispatch of more French Scalp missiles will weaken Russian air defences and radar facilities in Crimea, part of an incremental weakening of the Russian air superiority. Exports of grain are now approaching prewar levels, with an expectation that Ukraine’s entire harvest will be exported this year, helping to add 5% to 6% to Kyiv’s revenues and push growth to higher than 10% in 2024. Cameron has also been briefed that Ukrainian resilience to Russian attacks through the winter has been better than expected. More European countries are expected to make bilateral security commitments in the next fortnight, a sign of continued support that is balanced by the growing threat of US isolationism. With 7% of Russian GDP now devoted to defence and a drawdown of a third of the liquid element of the national wealth fund over the last year, Cameron thinks increased pressure on the Russian economy through sanctions, tightening the oil price cap and restriction of the export of Russian liquefied natural gas to Europe may be as fruitful this year as military advances. At a meeting with fellow leaders in Munich the foreign secretary intends to focus on European defence production and the unique moral case for seizing the profits derived from frozen Russian assets. Discussions within the G7 have intensified and EU leaders are likely in the next few weeks to press ahead with plans to seize the windfall profits from Russian investments in Euro-clear in Belgium.   Related: Republicans’ topsy-turvy take on aid for Ukraine reveals party in thrall to Trump   Cameron said: “Putin believes he can get away with aggression, that he can wait out the west. We have the resources, the economic might and the expertise. We need to show that we have the will to see this through. “We must stand up for freedom and match our words with action. On sanctions. On support for Ukraine. On defence production. And we must show unity; we must all stand with Ukraine and let them – and Russia – know that they have our support for the long haul. Cameron, unlike one of his successors as prime minister, Boris Johnson, unambiguously regards Donald Trump’s possible election as US president as a threat to Ukraine and Nato but is intent on trying to influence the Republican party so its current isolationist mood can be tempered."

        "content": "After the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, local Labour party meetings became the source of major headaches for the party leadership. While they were spaces for people to share their difficulties navigating rising levels of Islamophobic and antisemitic abuse, it was also where people expressed frustration at Keir Starmer’s handling of Labour’s position on the Israel-Gaza conflict. After hundreds of councillors left en masse and eight frontbenchers resigned their positions in order to back an immediate ceasefire in November, the party has tried to restore relations with disgruntled Muslim voters. But since Saturday, one particular meeting in north-west England has been the source of further frustration, resulting in the suspension of two parliamentary candidates: the Rochdale byelection candidate Azhar Ali and the former MP and Hyndburn candidate Graham Jones. Senior Labour figures believe Ali made “deeply offensive” remarks at a meeting in Hyndburn organised by a councillor soon after 7 October, while speaking to others councillors on the brink of quitting the party. The party officials have said Ali was trying to convince the Labour councillors to stay in the party, using what shadow cabinet members called “conspiracy theories” about Israel, in an effort to placate them as he “understood their perspective”. Another senior Labour source said: “We all thought it was totally out of character for him. It’s the only way this all made sense, he wanted to bridge that gap.” Party officials rushed to Ali’s defence, noting his good public record of being an ally to the Jewish community, having set up Labour groups such as Muslims Against Antisemitism, and his “swift and wholesome apology”. The meeting in which Ali claimed Israel had allowed Hamas to inflict its October attack was also attended by Jones. Labour figures are understood to believe a Labour councillor leaked the recording to the Mail newspapers. In a recording leaked to the Mail on Sunday, Ali was heard saying: “The Egyptians are saying that they warned Israel 10 days earlier … Americans warned them a day before [that] … there’s something happening. They deliberately took the security off, they allowed … that massacre that gives them the green light to do whatever they bloody want.” But after 36 hours, and more leaked recordings from the Daily Mail, his position as a Labour candidate became untenable. In another recording, Ali said “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were “giving crap” about the MP Andy McDonald, who was suspended by Labour after he used the controversial phrase “between the river and the sea” in a speech during a rally. The paper said Ali had claimed that Israel planned to “get rid of [Palestinians] from Gaza” and “grab” some of the land. Now another leaked recording, published by the rightwing political news website Guido Fawkes, allegedly has Jones telling the group: “Fucking Israel again.” Jones was allegedly recorded saying: “Unless there is a military alliance between us and that particular country, Nato or whatever, or an individual one, no British person should be fighting for any other country.” It has raised questions over Labour’s culture, if no one raised concerns over the clip when they were apparently made – long before Ali was selected in January as the candidate for Rochdale. There are also concerns over whether members of all ranking have confidence in using the party’s complaints system."

        "content": "Labour has suspended a second parliamentary candidate over their remarks about Israel, as Keir Starmer struggles to contain the fallout from the leak of a private meeting of party activists in Lancashire last year.\nParty sources said on Tuesday that Labour had suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn, less than 24 hours after the party withdrew its support from Azhar Ali, its candidate for the Rochdale byelection later this month.\nWith the party now looking for two new candidates for the general election, senior Labour figures were fighting among each other on Tuesday over who was to blame for the escalating crisis.\nOne Labour activist called the party’s handling of the controversy a “shitshow”. A senior Labour peer called it a “car crash”, adding: “We should be more careful in who we have as our candidates.”\nStarmer defended his decisions on Tuesday, after a damaging 48 hours in which he had initially backed Ali before changing his mind when new recordings emerged from the meeting.\n“Certain information came to light over the weekend in relation to the candidate [and] there was a fulsome apology,” he said. “Further information came to light yesterday calling for decisive action, so I took decisive action.”\nThe recordings all come from a single meeting in October, which sources have told the Guardian was held between Ali, Jones and a group of Labour councillors who were threatening to quit the party over its stance on Gaza.\nThe Middle East crisis has proved one of the most divisive issues for Labour in recent years, with many MPs, councillors and activists accusing Starmer of not going far enough in condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza.\nIn the latest recording, which was first reported on Tuesday by the Guido Fawkes website, Jones appeared to try to defend the Labour leader, but did so by expressing views that were condemned by Jewish Labour supporters as “appalling”.\nJones said during the meeting: “I’m sure when [world leaders] go home, like me, pardon my French [they say] ‘fucking Israel’ again.”\nHe went on to criticise British people who choose to fight for the Israel Defense Forces, saying wrongly that doing so was against the law.\n“No British person should be fighting for any other country at all, full stop,” he said. “It is against the law and you should be locked up.”\nThe Jewish Labour Movement issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying: “Graham Jones’s comments about British-Israeli Jews are appalling and unacceptable within the Labour party.”\nJones’s suspension came a day after the party withdrew its support for Ali over comments made at the same meeting, in which he said he believed Israel had deliberately allowed the Hamas attack on 7 October to happen as a pretext for its assault on the strip.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer initially backed Ali over his comments following a rapid apology from the Rochdale candidate, with one shadow minister saying Ali had “fallen for an online conspiracy theory which does not represent his view”.\nBut the Labour leader reversed that decision on Monday night after further details emerged from the meeting showing Ali had also blamed “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” for the suspension of the Labour MP Andy McDonald.\nWhile electoral rules mean Ali is technically still the Labour candidate for the Rochdale byelection later this month, the party is no longer giving him its support, meaning Labour officials and MPs will not travel to the constituency to help him.\nStarmer’s supporters say there was no way the Labour leader could have known about remarks made at a private meeting long before the Rochdale byelection was called – though many are now concerned about the prospect that George Galloway, the controversial former Labour MP, will win instead.\nOne Labour activist said: “My guess is Galloway wins unless Labour wants to be really brave and say vote for the Tory. It’s the worst outcome.” Bookmakers have now made Galloway the favourite to take the seat.\nSome have accused Starmer of fuelling factionalism within the party by acting more slowly against Ali than he has against party members on the left who have been punished for less extreme breaches over Israel.\nJamie Driscoll, the mayor of the North of Tyne, who was blocked from running again as a Labour mayoral candidate after appearing onstage with the pro-Palestinian film-maker Ken Loach – months before the Hamas attacks – said: “This all shows if you are on Team Keir you can behave how you like.”\nHowever, others say Starmer’s actions have been fuelled not by factionalism but by his slow decision-making process and a failure of political instinct.\nOne Jewish Labour MP said: “In retrospect it would have been the right thing to take a bold decision on Saturday.” A senior party adviser said: “I don’t know why we ever thought we would be able to get away with claiming that one of our candidates had ‘fallen for’ a conspiracy theory he didn’t believe in.”\nSome in the party are comparing the row of the last few days with the long-running saga over Labour’s plans to spend £28bn on green investment, which Starmer publicly dropped last week after weeks of reports saying he had already decided to do so.\nSue Gray, Starmer’s chief of staff, is conducting an inquiry into the source of those reports. But the inquiry itself is threatening to further exacerbate tensions within the party, with some staff members having filed a complaint about Gray’s behaviour."

        "content": "There was one crucial statistic in the cheating allegations that the Home Office levelled against more than 35,000 overseas students that instantly alerted Labour MP Stephen Timms to the likely presence of a huge miscarriage of justice. A dossier of evidence revealed that 97% of all international students who took a Home Office-approved English language test between 2011 and 2014 were suspected of cheating. “The figure of 97% seemed absurd. It was completely implausible. When I saw that the Home Office was saying that virtually everybody had either definitely or probably cheated, it crystallised my understanding that something had gone very badly wrong,” Timms says, in an interview this week in his Westminster office, overlooking the Thames and the London Eye. He was amazed that no one within the department had questioned whether it could really be true that 97% of the 58,000 students who sat a government-approved test, advertised on the Home Office website, could all have cheated. Almost all of them would have sat and passed an English language test previously to get admission to the university; many had studied in English medium schools and colleges before leaving their home countries and had good English. “Surely somebody in the Home Office seeing that should have said: ‘Hang on that can’t be right, that over 97% are cheats.’ So you have to conclude there must be people in the department who just think: ‘Well, they’re foreign, therefore they cheat.’ And I think that’s part of what went wrong here.” For the past eight years, Timms has been trying to persuade the Home Office to take responsibility for what he describes as the biggest miscarriage of justice he has encountered in three decades as an east London MP. Although he is calm and measured as he talks about what went wrong, he admits to finding the subject “very, very distressing”. The Home Office revoked about 35,000 student visas in response to a BBC investigation that revealed widespread cheating in English language tests run by Educational Testing Service (ETS), one of four official providers of a mandatory test required for visa renewals. There was initially no mechanism for students to appeal against the accusation. At least 2,500 were deported and more than 7,200 left the country voluntarily after being told they faced arrest and detention if they stayed. Thousands have spent years fighting the accusations in court, and over 3,700 have won against the Home Office. Timms does not contest that there were criminal groups accepting payments and ensuring candidates passed the test; at least 21 people received prison sentences for helping students cheat. But he believes that rather than 97% of students being involved a more likely figure is between “maybe 10% and 15%. It’s only a hunch.” He is optimistic that eventually the government will be forced to acknowledge that it made a huge mistake. Two Home Office ministers have admitted to him privately that they know something went wrong, but the department has failed to take steps to allow students to challenge the allegations against them without having to enter into prohibitively expensive legal proceedings. The logical step initially would have been to allow all the students to retake the tests, rather than instantly revoking visas. Now he wants officials to help those people who were expelled from their colleges to be allowed to return to study. “At the moment the Home Office is still in full denial, but once the truth is fully understood I find it difficult to see how applications for compensation can be avoided. And given the scale of the number of people involved, we could be talking about hundreds of millions. There’s an inevitability about it. These people have unjustly been put through years of misery.” A decade after the Home Office first made a blanket accusation of deception against tens of thousands of students who had travelled to the UK seeking a British university education, Timms is perplexed by how few people understand the huge scale of what went wrong. “It’s an absolute tragedy,” he says.   Related: English test scandal: reprieve plan was derailed by government reshuffle   He notes that there has been none of the public expression of dismay that the Post Office scandal provoked, despite close parallels between the two issues: large numbers of innocent people accused of deception on apparently flawed evidence. “I think there’s a lack of empathy for people from different backgrounds and cultures. There isn’t a sense of identification with the hardships that they’ve endured,” he says. He has a dossier of 46 students he has tried to help challenge mistaken accusations of cheating, with mixed results. Even in bare skeleton summary form, the cases make upsetting reading. Some students have been deported and subsequently let Timms’ office know that they are still fighting to clear their names from abroad. Some describe racking up over £30,000 of debt in wasted tuition fees and legal fees. Some describe finding basic errors in the evidence presented against them by ETS – mistaken names, nationalities, errors in the dates when and location where they are meant to have taken the test. Despite having been stabbed several times in the abdomen during a constituency surgery in 2010, Timms has continued to hold appointments every Friday afternoon in East Ham (with security just slightly improved by the addition of a bigger desk separating him and his visitors). In late 2015, he began getting visits from panicking students, mostly from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The students were both puzzled and horrified to have been accused of cheating. “It didn’t make sense. They clearly spoke English well enough to study in the UK,” he said. “They felt their world was at an end. They had pinned their own hopes and their family’s hopes entirely on securing a degree in the UK. But then there was an allegation of cheating, the money spent on fees was gone and they had no qualification. None of these students got any of their fees reimbursed.” One student from Bangladesh told Timms that his parents had put their entire life savings into his UK college fees. “Then he got a conviction from the British government for cheating. He said he couldn’t bear the shame of going home to face his family, having inflicted this absolutely shameful humiliation on them.” He is very critical of ETS for its mismanagement of the tests and blames Theresa May’s Home Office, which was working to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands and which introduced a series of hostile environment policies at the time that students were being accused of cheating. Her department maintained an attitude of scepticism towards students’ protestation of innocence, he says. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The 2014 investigation into the abuse of English language testing revealed systemic cheating which was indicative of significant organised fraud. Courts have consistently found the evidence was sufficient to take the action we did. We completely refute any allegations of racism, decisions were taken solely on the basis of the evidence provided to the department.” ETS said that at the time of the allegations its UK operations were contracted out to a subsidiary organisation ETS Global BV. That office was subsequently closed. The Home Office was paid a £1.6m settlement by ETS Global BV in 2018. Timms remains struck by the intensity of the betrayal the students felt. “These are young people who entrusted their future to Britain and, in reality, Britain has proved utterly untrustworthy and has wrecked their lives. All of them have had the start of their careers blighted for years. And many of them will never ever fully recover from what happened, some have permanent mental health problems. We treated them appallingly.”"

        "content": "Polly Toynbee rightly brands the Tory move to re-enfranchise British expatriates as “gerrymandering” (First photo ID, now votes for expats: the Tories are showing us exactly what election rigging looks like, 6 February). But the same applies to Labour’s efforts to prevent it. Both parties want to game our electoral system – one by enfranchising expats, the other by excluding them. What Toynbee ignores are the constitutional and moral issues at stake. In Japan, like many other societies where dual nationality is unavailable, foreign permanent residents cannot participate in any elections. Denying UK votes to UK citizens resident in such jurisdictions thus renders them electorally stateless. Meanwhile, Japanese residents in the UK (who far outnumber British residents in Japan) have always retained full voting rights in Japan’s elections. Internationally, the UK government’s previous rule on expats’ voting rights was an outlier, but it was part of a British regime that remains exceptionally discriminatory towards overseas citizens. Older people have their state pensions frozen and expats with foreign spouses are reduced to second-class citizenship by a visa system that prevents or deters many from returning to the UK. Few expat Britons are the Tory-voting tax exiles of Toynbee’s imagination. Many of them have contributed hugely as workers and taxpayers to the British economy, and their foreign experience is an invaluable resource to their home country. Now that they have their votes restored, all UK political parties would be well advised to take their concerns more seriously. Overseas voters who are keen to ensure this are invited to join the British Overseas Voters Forum (www.bovf.org.uk).Prof Edward VickersUnesco chair on education for peace, social justice and global citizenship, Kyushu University, Japan • In stating that “representation without taxation was whizzed through parliament on a statutory instrument in December”, Polly Toynbee is mistaken on two counts. First, a large proportion of British citizens living abroad do in fact pay tax in the UK in a variety of ways – in my own case, for example, on a government pension and on rental income. We pay tax without being a burden on society or a drain on resources. As taxpayers – and British passport holders – we have a right to a say in how our money is spent and to the ability to hold the government to account. Indeed, until our vote was recently restored, far from being a case of “representation without taxation”, it was the reverse. In addition, many of us have no vote in national elections in our country of residence and have therefore been disenfranchised. Second, this was in no way “whizzed through parliament”. The Conservative party pledged to remove the 15-year rule in three manifestos – in 2015, 2017 and 2019 – and there were several attempts to introduce the legislation prior to that. In April 2022, the Elections Act 2022 received royal assent. Various statutory instruments putting the act into effect were passed in 2023 and “votes for life” finally came into effect on 16 January 2024.Ruth WoodhouseNerja, Spain • So Polly Toynbee thinks it is a cynical move by the Tories to give us expats a vote. Fear not, for we read the news too and are appalled by the Conservatives. A great party (whatever you think) brought down by self-serving lightweights. I’m delighted to be able to vote them out of office. Sebastian Wilberforce Tai Tapu, New Zealand • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "The sale of a Downing Street visitors’ book from Margaret Thatcher and Sir John Major’s times in office has been postponed amid a dispute about its ownership, with the government claiming it is a piece of the nation’s history – and property. The red leather book contains the signatures of famous visitors including royalty and world leaders such as the former US president Ronald Reagan and Diana, Princess of Wales. The auctioneer has described it as “unique and historic”, with “a gilt-tooled front panel” and “gilt lettering”, and valued it at more than £10,000. The late queen and the Duke of Edinburgh signed the book during their visit marking the 250th anniversary of 10 Downing Street in December 1985. Other famous signatories include George HW Bush, the Princess Royal, Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the former prime ministers James Callaghan and Harold Wilson, and the heads of government who attended the G7 summit in July 1991. The book was put up for sale by a former civil servant in No 10, who said he found it among water-damaged boxes in a Whitehall basement more than 20 years ago, according to the auctioneer proposing to sell it. But the sale has been put on hold after the Cabinet Office said it was government property under the Public Records Act 1958. West London-based Chiswick Auctions has said it still intends to sell the book once ownership has been established, and claimed its client contacted No 10 twice – in 2017 and 2020 – to offer to return the book but received no response. While the auctioneer originally valued it between £10,000 and £15,000, it said it now has “every reason to believe” the eventual sale price might be higher due to a recent increase in interest. According to the auction house, the seller – who wants to remain anonymous – found the book after being given “permission and approval” to remove water-damaged boxes marked for incineration following a flood at 70 Whitehall. It was not until 2017 that he looked inside the boxes and, “to his amazement”, found the book packaged in tissue paper and bubble wrap. Valentina Borghi, the head of autographs and memorabilia at the auction house, said: “Having twice had no response from No 10, due to ill health and the cost of living crisis, my client has taken the very difficult decision to put the book up for auction in the hope of being able to meet some of those unaffordable expenses.” A Downing Street source told PA Media: “We will be taking steps to recover this crown property. The book is a piece of history – it belongs to the nation, not to an individual to be sold.” PA said it understood No 10 believed it had no record of the individual getting in contact in 2017 or 2020."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-13T17:07:51+00:00",
        "content": "The claim by Labour’s Rochdale byelection candidate Azhar Ali that Israel allowed the Hamas attacks on 7 October to provide pretext for invading Gaza was, he has admitted, “deeply offensive, ignorant, and false”. Labour’s election strategist Pat McFadden thought it “completely wrong”. So it could be seen as surprising that Labour expended such time, energy and political capital trying to protect him this week. The party’s view on Monday morning was steadfastly that Ali had apologised and would learn his lesson. So much so, in fact, that a shadow minister was sent out on the morning media round to make the case. That held for most of the day, before Labour took the path some had been urging it to all along and withdrew its support on Monday evening. But how does this compare with Keir Starmer’s handling of outrage over other members’ behaviour? Jeremy Corbyn Arguably the biggest fight Starmer could have taken on in his drive to convince the country the party had changed from that riven by the row over antisemitism: the political fate of his predecessor. And it was a long-running battle – the formal confirmation Corbyn would not stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election came nearly two-and-a-half years after his initial suspension. But it could not be said Starmer had shied away from the fight. He personally proposed the motion that finally ended Corbyn’s hopes. Diane Abbott Abbott threatened to reignite the row over whether or not Labour truly understands the severity of antisemitism last April when she suggested Jews were among a group of “white-seeming” people who experienced mere prejudice, not racism. Her suspension as a Labour MP came very quickly – the same day – but the investigation that will decide what ultimately happens to her rumbles on. Rebecca Long-Bailey In terms of timing, one of the quickest and most decisive moves to enforce discipline by the Labour leader. A few hours separated Long-Bailey publicly approving of an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake claimed the Israeli state taught US police to kneel on a person’s neck and her sacking as shadow education secretary. Peake later retracted the claims and Long-Bailey agreed to apologise, and to clarify that she had not meant to approve of everything the actor had said. But Starmer, she said, “had already made his decision”. Kate Osamor Another MP whose initial suspension came swiftly – another whose situation remains unresolved. Though, in Osamor’s case, this stretches to only a few weeks. She had the whip suspended in January while she is investigated for saying Gaza should be remembered as a genocide on Holocaust Memorial Day. In the wake of the withdrawal of support for Ali, Martin Forde – the KC whose report found Labour was not properly addressing racism allegations – noted that, while Osamor and Abbott had both apologised immediately, in their cases things “seemed to drag on”. Andy McDonald The former frontbencher, who had already resigned his shadow ministerial post in disgust at the direction Starmer was taking the party, was suspended as a Labour MP after  his speech at a march organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians and referenced the controversial phrase “between the river to the sea”. While its meaning is contested – some argue it calls for the wiping out of Israel, while others see it as simply a call for the freedom of Palestinians living in Israel and for Palestine to be respected – McDonald’s choice to reference it at a time of heightened antisemitism was deemed provocative. He did not face immediate sanction for the comments made in October. But, two days later, he had been suspended. And he remains so, sitting as an independent, pending investigation. Sam Tarry When the former senior trade union official stood on a picket line with striking RMT workers in July 2022, it was a direct challenge to Starmer, who had said no frontbencher should do so. But it was the series of interviews he gave that were not felt to be in line with party policy that convinced the Labour leader to act. In Tarry’s case, he did so quickly and decisively; sacking him as a shadow transport minister within hours. A few months later, Tarry was deselected as an MP by his local party members. • This article was amended on 14 February 2024 to make clear what Andy McDonald had said. His words were: “We will not rest until we have justice, until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea can live in peaceful liberty.”"

        "content": "\n 4.38pm GMT \nEnd of day summary …\n\nWe will shortly be closing the blog. Here are the day’s headlines …\n\nKeir Starmer has defended his handling of the controversy surrounding Labour’s candidate in Rochdale, who was suspended by the party on Monday night after days of revelations about remarks he made about Israel soon after the Hamas attacks. The Labour leader said on Tuesday he had taken tough and decisive action against Azhar Ali, who will now campaign for the Rochdale seat with no official support from the party.\nForeign secretary David Cameron has claimed he has personally challenged the Israeli government over specific incidents in Gaza, and said that a two state solution would not be a “reward” for Hamas. Cameron was speaking in the House of Lords. Cameron is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, this weekend for the first time since unexpectedly becoming British foreign secretary.\nThe UK government has confirmed details of a £3.3bn funding package to support the restored powersharing administration in Northern Ireland. However, Stormont’s finance minister Caoimhe Archibald has said it was “not acceptable” for the Treasury to make the write-off of a £559 million debt conditional on the publication and implementation of a sustainability plan at short notice.\nThe parliamentary commissioner has found Conservative MP David Duguid failed to declare his wife’s £50,000 shareholding in BP while speaking in debates about windfall taxes on the oil and gas industry. \nHousing minister Lee Rowley refused to say how many more homes the government hopes will be built under its new building plans – telling the BBC he wasn’t going to get into “a numbers game”. Under the proposals, councils would have to approve new development on brownfield land unless they can offer a good reason why they cannot.\nPay growth slowed less than expected in December. Earnings growth, excluding bonuses, fell only modestly to 6.2% in October to December 2023 from a revised 6.7% in the previous three months, as workers continued to bid up their wages amid skills shortages and a record number of people with long-term sickness.\nThe ONS has published data showing that the current government has presided over the highest total number of working days lost to strikes during a 19 month period for 30 years.\nThe much-delayed CalMac ferry Glen Sannox had her first sea test in Glasgow.\nSinn Féin MP for Mid Ulster Francie Molloy has announced he is stepping down at the next election.\n\nThank you very much for reading and all your comments, which I always appreciate. I will be back with you bright and early tomorrow, which will be the last day of campaigning in Kingswood and in Wellingborough ahead of Thursday’s byelections.\n\n\n\n 4.18pm GMT \n\nStormont’s finance minister Caoimhe Archibald has said it was “not acceptable” for the Treasury to make the write-off of a £559 million debt conditional on the publication and implementation of a sustainability plan at short notice.\nIn a letter to chief secretary to the treasury Laura Trott, the finance minister said\n\nMinisters are united and speak with one voice in the need to invest and reform our public services. Making the write off of the £559m for debt repayment conditional on the publication and implementation of a sustainability plan is not acceptable. It is our strong view that these debts exist primarily due to the underfunding of public services.\nThe executive has already given a commitment to the British Government to develop a sustainability plan with a pre-requisite that the right level of funding is provided.The government’s timescale requiring this to be published by May 2024 is completely unrealistic. It is essential that the executive is afforded adequate time to give proper consideration to this important matter.\n\nEarlier the UK government announced a funding settlement plan now that the Northern Ireland asssembly and devolved government has been restored. [See 13.37 GMT]\n\nUpdated at 4.33pm GMT\n\n\n 4.06pm GMT \n\nIn his last answer to these questions about the prospect of the UK recognising a Palestinian state, foreign secretary David Cameron has said in the House of Lords:\n\nRecognition is obviously part of a two state solution. And it’s something that should help with the momentum.\nThe point I’ve been making is that it should not be the first thing that we do. I think that would take the pressure off the Palestinians to reform and the things that need to happen in the Palestinian Authority.\nBut just because it doesn’t happen at the beginning, doesn’t mean it has to wait right till the end.\nAnd I think one of the things that is beginning to change, which I think is hopeful is the American posture up to now has been that recognition can only come when Israel and Palestine agree on the creation of a Palestinian state.\nIf you do that you do effectively give Israel a veto over a Palestinian state. And I think that’s the opposite of creating a sort of unstoppable momentum towards a two state solution that we all want to see.\n\n\n\n\n 4.02pm GMT \n\nForeign secretary David Cameron has been asked by the archbishop of Canterbury in the House of Lords about the occupied West Bank, where Justin Welby said “very large numbers of Palestinians have been killed by people who live in illegal settlements”. He also asked about support for Jordan.\nCameron said:\n\nHe’s absolutely right to say we should focus on what’s happening in the West Bank as well as Gaza, and it is a chilling statistic that since 7 October 96 Palestinian children have been killed in the West Bank. There have been a series of very worrying developments and disturbances. And that’s why the government is focused on this, and actually only yesterday, we for the first time announced some sanctions against violent settlers who were carrying out criminal acts in the West Bank. \n\nThe foreign secretary said the Jordanians are also working towards a two-state solution, adding:\n\nA crucial thing that needs to be sorted out is how you move from the current Palestinian authority that we have that has a number of issues and difficulties to a new technocratic government that would work across the Palestinian territories. And I think the Jordanians can play a big role in helping to bring that about.\n\n\n\n\n 3.56pm GMT \nTwo-state solution 'not rewarding Hamas', says Cameron\n\nDavid Cameron has been asked by Stewart Jackson (Conservative) did he speak to the US before he made his comments about the UK potentially recognising a Palestinian state. Cameron said:\n\nMy Lords, this government has always supported a two state solution and that remains the case. Clearly recognising a Palestinian state at the right time is part of that policy. My noble friend asks about consulting our allies. And of course, we discuss all issues relating to the conflict in Gaza and Israel-Palestine relations. But ultimately, I’m pleased to tell him that the UK has a sovereign and independent foreign policy, set by a British prime minister and a British foreign secretary in the British Parliament. \n\nJackson replied:\n\nHamas is a genocidal terror group – for the benefit of the BBC they are not militants. The Palestinian Authority has lost control of large cities in the West Bank, to Iranian backed terror groups, who openly pay salaries to convicted terrorists and is deeply corrupt and repressive.\nPalestinian statehood is, I trust ,something all of us in this house wish to see. Does my noble friend share my very grave concerns that premature unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state now risks rewarding Hamas playing into Iran’s hands and perhaps jeopardising the chances for a long term sustainable peace. \n\nCameron said:\n\nI absolutely understand where my noble friend is coming from. I would just say to him that of course, it isn’t rewarding Hamas. Hamas don’t believe in a two state solution. They believe in the destruction of Israel.\nAnd my point is that if you look at the whole point of a two state solution is to create long term sustainable peace, and I think the last 30 years have shown that we won’t solve this problem without a solution that gives dignity and security to Palestinian people, as well as giving vital security to Israel. So I say this, as a strong friend of Israel, that this is the right approach. And we should pursue it. \n\n\nUpdated at 4.06pm GMT\n\n\n 3.52pm GMT \n\nForeign secretary David Cameron has said that at the Munich security summit he hopes to engage China over the issue of freedom of navigation, stating that as trade is such an important component of their economy, the Chinese “should be as fully supportive of freedom of navigation as we are”.\n\n\n\n 3.47pm GMT \n\nDavid Cameron has described the Aukus pact as part of a strategic tilt to the Indo-Pacific. He has been asked about how the announcement did not go down well in Paris, and Cameron has said “ultimately, Britain and France should work to cooperate as closely as we can, because we are similar-sized powers with similar-sized militaries and similar-sized global ambitions.”\n\n\n\n 3.41pm GMT \n\nThe next question for foreign secretary David Cameron in the House of Lords is about the AUKUS security pact.\n\n\n\n 3.40pm GMT \n\nUK foreign secretary David Cameron has said that Israel has “every right to respond to” what he described as “the biggest pogrom since the Holocaust in terms of the loss of life of Jewish people”, but that “they must obey international humanitarian law.”\nSpeaking in the House of Lords, the former prime minister said:\n\nLet’s be clear, that involves not only what the IDF do in terms of the way they prosecute their actions in terms of this war, but it also means, as they are the occupying power in Gaza, that they have to make sure that humanitarian aid and food and water and shelter are available to people in Gaza, because if they don’t do that, that would be a breach of international humanitarian law as well. \n\n\n\n\n 3.37pm GMT \nCameron: I have personally challenged the Israel government over incidents in Gaza\n\nSpeaking in the House of Lords, foreign secretary David Cameron has said that he has personally challenged the Israeli government over individual incidents in Gaza.\nResponding to a question from Green party peer Natalie Bennett, who raised the case of Hind Rajab, he said:\n\nFirst of all, the case she raises is completely tragic. And what is happening in Gaza is tragic that we want to see an end to the suffering and end of this killing.\nLet me just make this point, that the pause we are calling for, we want to turn into a ceasefire, by making sure that the conditions are right for getting permanent ceasefire.\nThe way you do that is fulfilling a number of conditions. You’ve got to get, in our view Hamas leaders out of Gaza otherwise any ceasefire won’t last because the problem will still be there. You’ve got to dismantle the operation of terrorist attacks. You’ve got to have a new Palestinian Authority government in place. You’ve got to give the Palestinian people a political horizon to a better future, a two state solution, and crucially, you’ve got to release all of the hostages and do that very quickly. \nShe asked whether we challenge the Israeli government over individual episodes. Yes, we absolutely do. I’ve done that personally with them over, for instance, a building that was bombed that had UK medics and other charities in, and we will continue to do that as part of the very important process that we go through to judge whether they are in compliance with international humanitarian law. \n\n\n\n\n 3.32pm GMT \n\nNatalie Bennet is now asking David Cameron about what the UK is doing to help children in Gaza. He has said:\n\nMy Lords, the best way to address the humanitarian situation is by ending the fighting as soon as possible. That is why I’ve repeatedly said an immediate pause in fighting is necessary. UK aid is saving children’s lives. We’re doing everything we can to get more aid into Gaza. We’ve trebled our aid commitment to the occupied Palestinian territories. This includes targeted support for children through our 5.75m contribution to UNICEF, and children are also benefiting from life saving food, shelter and health support that we’re providing through partnerships with other UN agencies, through NGOs and the Red Crescent societies. \n\n\n\n\n 3.30pm GMT \n\nIt has to be said that having the foreign secretary face questions in the House of Lords is very far from the atmosphere that you imagine the former prime minister would face in the House of Commons.\n\n\n\n 3.29pm GMT \n\nIn the House of Lords, David Cameron says he wears as a badge of honour that he has been “personally sanctioned by Vladimir Putin”. He was speaking to Ray Collins, who has also faced sanctions from the Russian government, congratulating him on “joining a club of which I’m a member”.\n\n\n\n 3.25pm GMT \n\nThe first question to David Cameron in the Lords has been about global debt of developing countries. He has mentioned that the UK has worked with Rwanda since the 1990s to increase tax revenue tenfold there, and suggests that one of the best ways to help heavily indebted countries is to help them improve their own fiscal systems to raise revenue.\n\n\n\n 3.19pm GMT \nCameron questioned in Lords\n\nDavid Cameron, the foreign secretary, is appearing to be asked questions in the House of Lords. There is a live feed here.\n\nUpdated at 3.25pm GMT\n\n\n 3.11pm GMT \n\nRichard Partington is the Guardian’s economics correspondent\nThe head of Britain’s post-Brexit trade watchdog has said it is ready to follow Brussels in launching an investigation into Chinese companies flooding the market for electric cars, but the government has not asked it to do so.\nOliver Griffiths, the chief executive of the UK’s Trade Remedies Authority (TRA), which advises the government on trade defence, said it was keeping lines of communication open with ministers and had been in close contact with the car industry. “We’ll be ready to go if anyone does come to us,” he told the Guardian in an interview.\nThe European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) late last year after warning that global markets were being “flooded” with cheap imports from the world’s second largest economy.\nBritain would have been covered by the inquiry as a member state but has led an independent trade policy since leaving the EU four years ago. Under the UK’s post-Brexit system, the TRA can be called on by ministers or industry to investigate whether import controls are needed to protect Britain’s economic interests.\nHowever, Griffiths said no request by government or carmakers had been made since Brussels launched its investigation in October.\nRead more of Richard Partington’s report here: Post-Brexit watchdog ‘ready’ to investigate flood of cheaper Chinese electric cars\n\n Related: Post-Brexit watchdog ‘ready’ to investigate flood of cheaper Chinese electric cars \n\n\n\n\n 3.07pm GMT \n\nFor those of you who have been following the story of the delayed ferries being built at Ferguson Marine, the Glen Sannox has departed today for her first sea trials.\nCosts for Glen Sannox and sister ship Glen Rosa have more than tripled to at least £360m and they are expected to be delivered about six years late.\n\n\n\n 2.52pm GMT \n\nLabour’s Steve McCabe has been on GB News, and added his voice to those commenting on the withdrawal of support for the party’s candidate for the Rochdale byelection. The shadow minister for veterans told viewers:\n\nIt is obviously difficult and embarrassing for the Labour party. But I mean I think when you are confronted with a situation like this, you don’t have a choice and you have to do what you believe to be right.\nI have been involved in times where allegations have been made about candidates. Sometimes you have to weigh up. You know, you have to ask how important it is, what else is influencing it?\nI think the issue is that conditionally people were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he said his apology in good faith. But I think with the further revelations it was too late and that was just the end of it.\n\n\n\n\n 2.50pm GMT \n\nThe Daily Record’s political editor Paul Hutcheon is claiming an exclusive that Labour in Scotland are set to back an “immediate” ceasefire in Gaza at their conference at the weekend.\nLabour’s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, told the paper that he welcomed those planning to attend a protest in Glasgow on Saturday, saying:\n\nWhat I’d say to those protesting is I understand your anger. I want peace in the Middle East. So, yes, come make your voice heard, you have every right to do that, but do so in a peaceful way because ultimately we want the same thing. \nOn the same Saturday of the march our conference will be doing our own plea in terms of supporting the humanitarian effort in Gaza, and we will also be debating and passing a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. The very things people will be demanding outside the hall we will be calling for inside the hall.\nThe violence has to stop. We need a ceasefire now. We need the immediate release of hostages. We need immediate access to humanitarian aid and we need a pathway to a peace process.\n\n\n\n\n 2.39pm GMT \n\nThe House of Lords has started sitting for the afternoon. There will be oral questions, scheduled for 40 minutes, and then foreign secretary David Cameron is appearing for questions before the house. \nThere are four questions tabled for him:\n\nwhat recent discussions he has had with international counterparts on a strategy to reduce debt in the developing world from Ray Collins (Lab)\nwhat his department is doing to ensure the lives and security of the children of Gaza from Natalie Bennett (Green)\nwhat progress the government has made in implementing the AUKUS security partnership between the UK, Australia and the US from John Woodcock (crossbench)\nwhat discussions he had with the government of the US before his announcement on 1 February that the United Kingdom should recognise a Palestinian state in advance of the conclusion of any future bilateral talks between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian people from Stewart Jackson (Conservative)\n\nHere is a reminder of what Cameron said about the potential recognition of a Palestinian state.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.57pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer was campaigning in Wellingborough, where Labour has been odds-on to overturn the majority of more than 18,000 won by disgraced former Conservative MP Peter Bone in 2019.\nAs Toby Helm noted last weekend, “The circumstances of Bone’s departure and subsequent selection of his partner Helen Harrison as the Tory candidate to replace him, have left local people angry and disillusioned. Tory MPs are refusing to campaign in Wellingborough for fear of being ridiculed and insulted, and because they think it would be a complete waste of their time.”\nThat byelection, and the one in Kingswood are on Thursday. The Rochdale byelection takes place on 29 February.\n Interactive\n\n\n Related: ‘Anyone but Peter Bone’: voters turn to Labour and Reform UK as Wellingborough byelection nears \n\n\nUpdated at 3.17pm GMT\n\n\n 1.52pm GMT \n\nAndrew Fisher, one of the architects of Labour’s 2017 manifesto, has said Labour “have made the correct decision” over Azhar Ali candidacy in Rochdale, but argued that it highlights fundamental problems with the party’s processes.\nFisher, who quit as an advisor to Jeremy Corbyn prior to the 2019 election, told Sky News:\n\nThey should have done it straight away when the first allegation against him was raised on Sunday. Instead, they were out canvassing for him on Sunday and sent shadow cabinet members all around the media, including Sky News, to defend him, as if this was some kind of one-off error he had made.\nOf course, further allegations have come out.

There was a fulsome apology. Further information came to light yesterday calling for decisive action, so I took decisive action.\nIt is a huge thing to withdraw support for a Labour candidate during the course of a by-election. It’s a tough decision, a necessary decision, but when I say the Labour Party has changed under my leadership I mean it.\n\nStarmer said any allegations against other Labour councillors present at the event at which Azhar Ali made his remarks would be “fully investigated by the party”. He said:\n\nThose comments were appalling and that is why we took decisive action. It is virtually unprecedented to withdraw support for a candidate in the way I withdrew support from this candidate yesterday. That’s what a changed Labour Party is all about. Of course, any allegation will be fully investigated by the party, but the important thing is the decisive action that’s been taken to make it absolutely clear that this is a changed Labour Party.\n\nResponding to accusations that factionalism had played a part in Labour’s handling of the case, the opposition leader said:\n\nI set out four years ago to tear antisemitism out of the Labour Party. It’s the first thing I said I’d do as Labour leader, and to change our party. I have taken a series of decisions along those lines ruthlessly changing our party, and it’s made no difference to me where somebody stands in the Labour party. The change I’ve brought about is a Labour party that is now back in the service of working people.\n\n\n\n\n 12.39pm GMT \n\nSadiq Khan’s London Plan for housing works to “frustrate rather than facilitate the delivery of new homes”, a report commissioned by Michael Gove has said.\nThe review of the mayor’s strategy, published on Tuesday, said the consequences of housing under-delivery have significant economic, societal and personal impacts, particularly on those who face no alternative but to live in temporary accommodation, or are forced into poor-quality rental accommodation, PA reports. \nThe report also said:\n\nPublic and private sector stakeholders are clear in their view that the London Plan is not the sole source of the problem: wider macro-economic conditions; fire safety; infrastructure constraints; statutory consultees; viability difficulties; and planning resourcing pressures have all contributed.\n\n\nHowever, there is persuasive evidence that the combined effect of the multiplicity of policies in the London Plan now works to frustrate rather than facilitate the delivery of new homes, not least in creating very real challenges to the viability of schemes.”\n\n\n\n\n 11.30am GMT \n\nThe ONS has published data showing that the current government has presided over the highest total number of working days lost to strikes during a 19 month period for 30 years.\n5.05m days are estimated to have been lost in labour disputes in the UK from June 2022 to December 2023, the highest since 5.34m days were lost from July 1989 to January 1991.\nSome disputes remain unresolved, including those involving junior doctors and some train unions.\n\nUpdated at 1.02pm GMT\n\n\n 11.24am GMT \n\nFirst minister of Northern Ireland Michelle O’Neill has paid tribute to Francie Molloy, who has announced this morning that he is stepping away from politics.

He was heavily involved in the early civil rights movement, including the protest outside the Caledon Squat in 1968 which is often considered as the spark for people in their demand for better housing, better jobs, and civil rights.

MPs have to register shares they own worth £70,000 or more than 15%, and any other interests that might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”. Duguid has never disclosed his wife’s financial interest in the House of Commons register.\nThe Guardian’s analysis of BP’s share register suggested Duguid, who worked for 25 years in the oil and gas industry, including 10 years with BP, had moved his shares into his wife’s name five years before his election as an MP.\nThe commissioner found three debates in 2023 in which Duguid ought to have declared an interest, noting that in these debates the shareholding “might reasonably be thought by others to influence [his] words or actions as a member”.\nDuguid told the commissioner that he did not believe “anything I could have, let alone actually, said or did as a member of parliament could have had any bearing on the BP share price”.\nThe commissioner decided that Duguid’s repeated failures to declare the interest were “inadvertent” and the result of a misunderstanding about the rules. The commissioner required Duguid to apologise and to attend training on the parliamentary rules on declaration of interests.\nRead more here: Tory MP David Duguid failed to declare wife’s BP shares during oil and gas debates\n\n Related: Tory MP David Duguid failed to declare wife’s BP shares during oil and gas debates \n\n\n\n\n 10.55am GMT \n\nHere is my colleague Geneva Abdul’s report on the reaction this morning to Labour pulling its support from its Rochdale byelection candidate:\nLabour’s decision to withdraw support for its candidate at the Rochdale byelection in the wake of controversial comments about the 7 October Hamas attacks has been “shambolic”, the senior lawyer who compiled a report on the party’s culture has said.\nMartin Forde KC was commissioned by Keir Starmer to investigate allegations of bullying, racism and sexism within the party’s ranks after a leaked Labour document made explosive allegations about its handling of antisemitism claims.\nForde has said the party’s change in position in response to Ali’s “very inflammatory” and “clearly antisemitic” remarks “appears shambolic”.\n“It seems to me that the moment that anyone says that the Israeli authorities allowed the atrocities to occur, that has to bring their judgment into question,” Forde told BBC’s Radio 4’s Today programme.\n“One does have to question how such individuals are selected in the first place and also the disparity in treatment because one of the things that concerned us when we talked about weaponisation was certainly the perception that antisemitism was along factional lines.”\nIn 2022, Forde published a 139-page report accusing Labour of “operating a hierarchy of racism or of discrimination”. Labour was urged to implement 165 recommendations, many of which the party says it has followed. A year after the report’s publication, Forde accused Labour of not taking anti-black racism and Islamophobia as seriously as antisemitism within the party.\nRead more of Geneva Abdul’s report here: Labour handling of Azhar Ali ‘shambolic’, says antisemitism report author\n\n Related: Labour handling of Azhar Ali ‘shambolic’, says antisemitism report author \n\n\n\n\n 10.52am GMT \n\nI mentioned earlier that housing minister Lee Rowley got in a dig at London Mayor Sadiq Khan during his media round while trying to promote the government’s plan for housing.

My colleague Helen Pidd mentioned this in her analysis piece last night. He stepped aside after “what he described as his ‘regrettable’ social media remarks about Gaza and Muslims” emerged.\nLast week he said:\n\nThe Green message is too urgent and too important to be distracted by some regrettable social media posts I made a number of years ago. In the interests of the Green party I have decided to leave the stage. As nominations have now closed, my name will still appear on the ballot. However, I will not take part in any media interviews or join any platforms for hustings, and neither will I be involved in any campaigning.\n\nThe postings on Twitter were made in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nThe party said:\n\nWe do not comment on disciplinary matters regarding Green party members. These are internal matters. However, we are clear, we condemn all forms of racism and discrimination and do not accept it from any Green party representative or spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\n 9.40am GMT \n\nRishi Sunak gave some reaction to the news about Labour withdrawing its support for Rochdale byelection candidate Azhar Ali last night as the prime minister was conducting an hour long Q&A on GB News.\nHe said the Labour party had not changed under Keir Starmer, saying “[Starmer has] stood by and sent cabinet ministers to support [Ali], until literally five minutes before I walked on tonight, under enormous media pressure, has decided to change his mind on principle. No principles at all. So no the Labour Party hasn’t changed. It’s a con.”\nLabour’s statement on the withdrawal read:\n\nFollowing new information about further comments made by Azhar Ali coming to light today, the Labour Party has withdrawn its support for Azhar Ali as our candidate in the Rochdale by-election. Keir Starmer has changed Labour so that it is unrecognisible from the party of 2019. We understand that these are highly unusual circumstances but it is vital that any candidate put forward by Labour fully represents its aims and values. Given that nominations have now closed Azhar Ali cannot be replaced as the candidate.\n\nThat means that Rochdale will have a choice of the following candidates on 29 February:\n\nAzhar Ali (Labour, but no longer backed by the party)\nMark Coleman (Independent)\nSimon Danczuk (Reform UK)\nIain Donaldson (Lib Dem)\nPaul Ellison (Conservative)\nGeorge Galloway (Workers party)\nMichael Howarth (Independent)\nWilliam Howarth (Independent)\nGuy Otten (Green, but no longer backed by the party)\nRavin Rodent Subortna (Monster Raving Loony)\nDavid Tully(Independent)\n\nWorth noting as well, with all the focus on Rochdale, that there are two byelections this week, with the Conservatives attempting to defend the constituencies of Kingswood and Wellingborough. Poor results there for Rishi Sunak’s party might very well quickly turn the attention back to potential leadership challenges among the Tory ranks.\n\n\n\n 9.16am GMT \n\nHousing minister Lee Rowley was on the media round for the government this morning, hoping to push their new housebuilding plans. He refused, however, to say how many more homes the government hopes will be built, telling the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he would not get into a “numbers game”.\nKiran Stacey reports for us on what the plans entail, writing:\n\nUnder the proposals, councils would have to approve new development on brownfield land – land which was previously developed but has fallen into disuse – unless they can offer a good reason why they cannot.\nLimits will also be removed on the kinds of former commercial buildings that can be turned into flats, removing restrictions on how big the building can be before a developer has to apply for planning permission.\nMinisters will also consult on making it easier for homeowners to extend their houses without seeking planning permission.\n\nSpeaking on Times Radio, Rowley said “There’s a lot of progress being made but we need to go further. We got housebuilding up to about 240,000 a year before Covid. We know there are challenges with inflation, we know that housebuilding has slowed down, we’re trying to support that.”\nHe added: “Of course it’s not perfect, I mean, I wouldn’t claim that was the case.”\nPut to him later on the BBC that the Conservative government has failed to meet its 2019 manifesto pledge to build 300,000 new homes a year, he replied: “The government is focused on increasing housing in general and we have made good progress on doing that in the last ten years.”\nHe also took the opportunity to have a dig at London’s mayor, saying “I don’t have a specific number. What the government is trying to do is change the framework so that there are more that can come forward, so that we can give developers the opportunity to bring more through. You can see when you go around places like London, which has consistently failed to deliver on housing targets, where Sadiq Khan has consistently failed to do that.”\nRead more of Kiran Stacey’s report here: Sunak reveals plan to boost brownfield homebuilding in England\n\n Related: Sunak reveals plan to boost brownfield homebuilding in England \n\n\n\n\n 9.04am GMT \n\nThe Suella Braverman column in the Telegraph, which they used to generate their lead story in print today, claims that “the desperation to see identity politics in every aspect of our lives is creating a divided society”.\nIn it, the former home secretary reminisces about childhood holidays in the countryside, and uses those as a backdrop with which to criticise a recent report by Wildlife and Countryside Link which has been framed in some parts of the media as claiming that the countryside environment is racist.\nBraverman writes:\n\nTo claim that the countryside is racist is one of the most ridiculous examples of Left-wing identity politics. It’s a symptom of a deeper problem within our society – the urge to constantly view everything through the lens of race or gender, plead victimhood and point the finger at an oppressor. Whether it’s the patriarchy, or colonial masters, this desperation to divide society is ripping through our institutions, creating a culture of fear and self-censorship. \n\nAt the time of the report a few days ago, head of the Wildlife and Countryside Link Richard Benwell was quoted as saying:\n\nSadly, evidence shows that people of colour in the UK are more likely to live in areas with less green space and that are more heavily polluted, and at the same time they are significantly less likely to visit natural spaces. There are multiple complex reasons behind this, as well as contemporary well-documented experiences of racism people encounter.\n\n\n\n\n 8.43am GMT \n\nThere is economic news this morning – UK pay growth has slowed, albeit by less than expected. My colleague Phillip Inman writes:\n\nThe ONS said annual growth in regular earnings, excluding bonuses, was 6.2% in October to December 2023, while pay rises including bonuses was 5.8%.\nAfter wages were adjusted for inflation, the ONS said workers enjoyed a fourth month of real wage increases. Total pay rose on the year by 1.6% above the consumer prices index and regular pay rose on the year by 1.9% in October to December 2023.\n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: “It’s good news that real wages are on the up for the sixth month in a row and unemployment remains low, but the job isn’t done. Our tax cuts are part of a plan to get people back to work so we can grow the economy – but we must stick with it.”\nRead more here: UK pay growth slows less than expected as workers bid up wages\n\n Related: UK pay growth slows less than expected as workers bid up wages \n\n\n\n\n 8.36am GMT \n\nHere is a quick scoot around the front pages.

It was meant to be a tough week for Rishi Sunak, with the prospect of unwelcome economic news, two tricky byelections on Thursday, and the Rwanda deportation bill under scrutiny in the House of the Lords. And yet this morning the focus is very much on Keir Starmer and Labour’s decision to withdraw its support for Rochdale candidate Azhar Ali after his Israel-Gaza remarks, after backing him during most of yesterday.\nHere are the headlines …\n\nLabour has withdrawn its support for Azhar Ali, its candidate for this month’s Rochdale byelection, in the wake of controversial comments he made about the 7 October attacks on Israel. In line with electoral law, Labour cannot replace Ali with another candidate because the deadline passed on 2 February. He will stand as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper, but if elected he will not hold the party whip and will sit as an independent MP.\nRishi Sunak has said he is “absolutely committed” to his Rwanda policy during a one-hour Q&A session on GB News in which he insisted he understands the country’s frustrations after 14 years of Conservative-led government. The prime minister told voters that the Rwanda deportations scheme was necessary as a “deterrent” to channel crossings.\nSunak’s government is also announcing a series of proposed changes to the planning system on Tuesday to encourage developers to build more homes. It is a mover the Conservatives claim is designed to boost development in urban areas even while housebuilding slumps nationally.\n\nThe Commons is in recess. The Lords is sitting from 2.30pm. The Senedd and the Scottish parliament are not sitting. In Stormont there is a plenary session from 10.30am and a business committee meeting from 1pm.\nIt is Martin Belam here with you today. I do try to read and dip into the comments when I can, but if you want to get my attention the best way is to email me – martin.belam@theguardian.com – especially if you have spotted an error or typo.\n\n"

        "content": "There was no sign of life inside Labour’s campaign headquarters in Rochdale on Tuesday morning. With just two and a half weeks to go until the town’s key byelection, the office ought to have been a hive of activity with the party seeking to defend and perhaps even build on the 9,668 majority left by Rochdale’s last MP, Tony Lloyd, who died in January. Instead, the shutters were down after Labour withdrew from the race and disowned its candidate in an antisemitism scandal. On Monday night, party high command ordered all canvassers to down tools. They were to knock on no more doors, take down any Labour posters and behave as if the byelection was not happening. Not everyone got the memo: on Tuesday lunchtime the Guardian spotted a garden board exhorting voters in the Kingsway ward to choose Azhar Ali, “A strong voice for Rochdale”. It was unfortunate timing that it was on Tuesday that households in Rochdale began receiving a leaflet from Labour with Ali’s smiling face on it. Labour had contracted the Royal Mail to deliver the literature to every house in the constituency and it was too late to cancel. Thanks to having a surname at the start of the alphabet, Ali will still appear top of the ballot as a Labour candidate on 29 February, next to the party’s red rose logo. The deadline for him to withdraw has passed. He may even win, only to find himself in parliament as an independent MP. Two doors down from Labour HQ at Linear Design, Shafiq Iqbal predicted a victory for George Galloway, the former Labour MP who has spent the past 19 years trolling the party by standing against its candidates – occasionally with success (Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012). “I got a kiss from George Galloway on the weekend,” said Iqbal. Galloway turned up at a fundraising event in Manchester, and Iqbal approached his table: “I said, ‘George, I love you and I love everything that you are doing, not only for the Asian community, the Muslim community, but this massive support that you give to the Palestinian people.’ I had my arm around his shoulders. He lent over and kissed me on the neck and said, ‘I love you too.’” Iqbal has only ever voted Labour before. “Labour always would have been the party I would have voted for, and all I have voted for in all these years. But now that this seat has become available I feel George Galloway is the man to vote for. I will give him my support, as will my family and friends.” He had heard about Ali’s defenestration, but always thought Labour was heading for defeat because of Keir Starmer’s refusal to back an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Just 30% of Rochdale’s population are Muslim, but Iqbal believes that by capturing the vote of that community en masse, Galloway can win. “With it being a byelection I feel the other 70% may not come out as much. The Muslim community will definitely come out in large, strong numbers,” he said. Jamie Watson, who runs the computer shop next door, said Ali had “no option to stand down”. But he thought the former Labour candidate would still win, and that he would most likely give the party his vote. “There’s going to be a general election and I would rather see a Labour government than a Conservative government. So irrespective of my views about the candidate, and the comments he made, there’s a bigger picture. If there wasn’t a general election, it might be a different story.” Christine, who did not want to give her last name, said she had been horrified by Ali’s remarks, leaked to the Mail on Sunday, in which he suggested Israel deliberately allowed 1,400 of its citizens to be massacred on 7 October in order to give it the “green light” for military action in Gaza. Starmer should have sacked him on the spot, she said. “I’m not happy and I’m very glad that they have withdrawn him.” Previously a Labour voter, she said she was “now thinking of voting Lib Dem” for the first time. “I’m very dissatisfied with Labour and I’m very dissatisfied with the Conservatives,” she said. Though Rochdale has elected Lib Dem MPs in the past, most recently in 2005, the party does not think it has a serious chance in the byelection. A party source said it did not have the resources to campaign properly in such a tight timeframe, and would “stick to our strategy of targeting Conservative-facing seats”. It was not just Muslim voters who were concerned with the plight of the Palestinians, said Kevin Binns, a truck driver. He thought Ali should not have apologised. “If you’ve got anything to say about Israel now, the Labour party call you antisemitic, just for expressing your views – valid views,’” he said. “I’ve been a Labour supporter all my life but I wasn’t going to vote for them this time anyway, because Keir Starmer is taking it too far to the right for me. It’s just becoming a pale imitation of the Conservative party, doing anything to get the mainstream media on side.”  Binns said he would either stay home or vote Galloway. “I don’t agree with 10% of what he says, but 90% I do agree with. He’s got an appeal to the workers. He’s very leftwing as well, whereas the Labour party now are not representing the workers any more.” From safe Labour seat to potential Galloway citadel within the space of a week: just another chapter in the increasingly unpredictable world of UK politics. • This article was amended on 15 February 2024.

In a judgment by the upper tribunal, the Home Office was criticised for its “shockingly poor” and “seriously flawed” handling of the visa application. The judge described a “litany of errors” made by the Home Office, including the “deliberate” and “unlawful” decision not to notify Ashkar that the visa refusal had been certified by the then home secretary, Suella Braverman. This led to the legal challenge being brought forward to the wrong court. Ashkar, who was born and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, said she “felt that my life was falling apart”. Ashkar completed a master’s degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) after being awarded the Chevening scholarship by the Foreign Office in August 2019. She returned to Lebanon and applied for a visa to study for a PhD at LSE in August 2022 and the Home Office rejected the application on the grounds that Ashkar’s presence in the UK was not “conducive to the public good”. The academic challenged the Home Office’s decision with a judicial review but it was later discovered that Braverman as home secretary had certified the visa refusal. This meant the legal challenge should have been brought before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. The judge described the “grave situation” that James Cleverly, now the home secretary, found himself in due to the failure to inform the tribunal of the certification decision. The tribunal ultimately decided not to initiate contempt of court proceedings as it was deemed “not necessary or proportionate”. Ashkar said she “felt the unfairness” when discovering that Braverman had personally certified the decision. She said: “As someone who’s Palestinian … I was really baffled and puzzled [as to] why this was happening. I couldn’t think of anything except me being a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon being the reason because why would someone do something like that without even giv[ing] a reason.”  Ashkar’s lawyer, Alexander Hogg of Gold Jennings Solicitors, said there was a “central contradiction” at the heart of the visa rejection. He said: “On the one hand you have the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] awarding Amena a Chevening scholarship, which on its own website they say are for ‘emerging leaders’ … Then, on the other hand you have the Home Office refus[ing] Amena a visa on the basis that her presence in the UK will not be conducive for the public good and not providing any reason.” Cleverly said he was willing to make a fresh decision on Ashkar’s visa application. In response to the claims, a spokesperson for the Home Office said: “It is longstanding government policy that we do not routinely comment on individual cases.” Ashkar, who is now working as a research assistant in Qatar, said: “I really hope I just get the visa and go to LSE, I just want to start my PhD. I want to know: why did this happen? I earned that scholarship, I earned that position. And it’s not fair that I’m not getting it without even knowing why.”"

        "content": "With Labour withdrawing support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, at the 11th hour, the Rochdale byelection on 29 February has been blown wide open. The candidates on the all-male ballot paper include George Galloway, who has been canvassing support among the Muslim population, and the seat’s former MP Simon Danczuk, who has appeared as a last-minute candidate for Reform UK. Here’s a run-down of the candidates and what they stand for: Azhar Ali – Labour Ali has spoken out frequently about Palestine, going further than the leadership and calling for an immediate ceasefire. He is the leader of the Labour group on Lancashire county council, a former government adviser under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and has received an OBE for services to his local community. He described Rochdale’s late MP, Tony Lloyd, who died from blood cancer in January, as a “dear friend”, adding that he wanted to “continue his legacy”. But at 5.30pm on Monday, Labour pulled its support for Ali over controversial comments he had made about Israel. It had emerged over the weekend that he said Israel “allowed” the 7 October Hamas attacks to happen so the country could do “whatever they bloody want”. Ali issued a statement “apologising unreservedly” for his words, and initially the Labour leadership stood by him – but when further comments emerged this week, they disowned him. It’s too late for Labour to remove Ali from the ballot paper, so he will still stand as a Labour candidate, but if elected he will have the whip removed and become an independent MP. Simon Danczuk – Reform UK There is talk that Labour members could switch their support to Danczuk, who is standing for Reform UK – the former Brexit party, led by the multimillionaire Richard Tice. He was Labour MP for Rochdale from 2010 until 2017 but was suspended from the party for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl and blocked from standing again. Danczuk has described himself as “old Labour” and criticised Starmer’s politics for going from “work to woke”. He believes his ticket to success will be focusing on local issues in Rochdale, rather than the Israel-Palestine conflict. “It’s now a fight between Galloway, who will prioritise Palestine, and me, who will prioritise Rochdale,” he said on Monday. Iain Donaldson – Liberal Democrats Donaldson, a former councillor in Manchester for 19 years, is focusing on key Lib Dem byelection campaign issues such as the cost of living crisis, the NHS crisis and sewage dumping in Rochdale’s rivers. He has received the endorsement of Paul Rowen, who served as Lib Dem MP for Rochdale from 2005 to 2010, and who said Donaldson would be a “fresh start” for the seat. Donaldson has accused Labour of “taking people for granted”, while saying the Conservatives had inflicted the “double whammy of a cost of living crisis and an NHS on its knees”. Paul Ellison – Conservative Former Rochdale Man of the Year 2020, Ellison is making the most of his “Rochdale born and bred” credentials and homing in on local issues – improving the town centre, cracking down on antisocial behaviour and protecting green spaces. He runs a landscaping firm and is known for his efforts in bringing Royal Horticultural Society in Bloom initiatives to the town. He said he wanted to overturn negative perceptions of the town and instil pride in local residents. George Galloway – Workers party of Britain Former MP Galloway has focused his attention almost entirely on Palestine and has been seen walking around majority-Muslim areas of Rochdale in a Palestine scarf and megaphone calling on them to vote for him in the “ultimate protest” against Labour. His previous election campaigning has been known to stoke division, particularly along religious lines – in Rochdale, Muslims make up 30% of the population, and Galloway is targeting these voters. Starmer’s refusal to back a ceasefire in Gaza, and the ensuing dissatisfaction, particularly among Muslim voters, has been used as ammunition by Galloway, but some question whether he has the widespread appeal needed to top the ballot. Guy Otten – Green party A retired solicitor and tribunal judge, Otten is the Green party candidate on paper only, after the party withdrew its support for him last week only days after he became candidate. This was reportedly in response to some remarks he had made on social media, criticising the Gaza conflict and “Islamic religion”. Otten said he would “leave the stage” after his party withdrew support, and has not taken part in any campaigning, hustings or media interviews since. Others Other candidates standing in Thursday’s election include William Howarth, a co-founder of Parents Against Grooming UK, and Rev Mark Coleman, a climate campaigner who spent five weeks in prison last year for taking part in an Insulate Britain sit-in protest in London. Local businessman David Tully is standing as an independent, Ravin Rodent Subortna for the Official Monster Raving Loony party, and Michael Howarth, a businessman who owns a number of bars in the area, is also standing as an independent."

        "content": "David Cameron is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, this weekend for the first time since becoming British foreign secretary. The Foreign Office has pencilled in a meeting between Cameron and Wang at the Munich security conference, according to two government sources. It would be the first time Cameron has met a Chinese minister since his surprise appointment to Rishi Sunak’s cabinet in November last year. Cameron has come under pressure over his links to China since becoming foreign secretary, and he faces calls to raise human rights and national security concerns at his meeting with Wang. Former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, who has been sanctioned by the Chinese government for criticising its human rights record, said: “David Cameron should raise the issue of the genocide of the Uyghurs, slave labour in non-Han Chinese ethnic groups such as the Tibetans, the appalling treatment of British citizen Jimmy Lai and the use of torture in gaining prosecution evidence.” “He should also call for the sanctions imposed on British parliamentarians to be rescinded.” Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: “The Foreign Office has been slow to realise that when Beijing says it wants win-win diplomacy, it means China wins twice. “Cameron needs to show that the blinkers are off, and raise British citizen Jimmy Lai’s show trial, Beijing’s support for Putin’s war, and anti-Uyghur atrocities in Xinjiang, which flood the UK market with slavery-tainted goods.” The trial of the British citizen and newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, who has been charged in Hong Kong with colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security, is being closely watched amid concerns about the growing influence of Beijing in the former British colony. Cameron publicly called for an end to Lai’s “politically motivated prosecution” in a statement on 17 December, saying: “As a prominent and outspoken journalist and publisher, Jimmy Lai has been targeted in a clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association.” Separately, Cameron has used interviews to stress the importance of engagement with China. As prime minister he heralded a “golden era” in relations with the country and hosted a state visit for President Xi Jinping in 2015. After leaving No 10 in 2016, he was involved in setting up a $1bn UK-China investment fund, which aimed to boost UK involvement in the belt and road initiative, Beijing’s flagship foreign policy aimed at extending its trade and military influence globally. Cameron met Xi for dinner in 2018 and discussed the $1bn fund. It was eventually wound up as relations between London and Beijing soured. Last autumn, weeks before he was made foreign secretary, Cameron was paid to fly to Dubai and Abu Dhabi and drum up foreign investment in a controversial Chinese-funded port city in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Critics have branded the development an example of Chinese debt-trap diplomacy. There was criticism when Cameron’s first published register of interests in the House of Lords made no mention of Port City Colombo or the $1bn UK-China fund. His office has insisted that his involvement with Port City Colombo was organised entirely via the Washington Speakers Bureau. UK-China relations have deteriorated since 2018 after Beijing’s crackdown on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, concerns about human rights abuses against the Uyghur community in Xinjiang and national security worries about Chinese involvement in UK critical infrastructure. Cameron spoke to Wang on the phone on 5 December and agreed to have a “constructive relationship”. In a post on X at the time, Cameron said: “The UK will continue to engage with China where it furthers our interests.” The Foreign Office declined to comment and said that Cameron’s bilateral meetings would be confirmed in the usual way."

        "content": "The Conservative MP David Duguid failed to declare his wife’s £50,000 shareholding in BP while speaking in debates about windfall taxes on the oil and gas industry, the parliamentary commissioner has found. The parliamentary commissioner for standards carried out an investigation into the MP for Banff and Buchan and former Scotland Office minister after the Guardian revealed Duguid’s wife’s shareholdings. Parliamentary rules require MPs to declare while speaking in debates the financial interests of a spouse or other family member, where there could be considered a conflict. MPs have to register shares they own worth £70,000 or more than 15%, and any other interests that might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”. Duguid has never disclosed his wife’s financial interest in the House of Commons register. The Guardian’s analysis of BP’s share register suggested Duguid, who worked for 25 years in the oil and gas industry, including 10 years with BP, had moved his shares into his wife’s name five years before his election as an MP. The commissioner found three debates in 2023 in which Duguid ought to have declared an interest, noting that in these debates the shareholding “might reasonably be thought by others to influence [his] words or actions as a member”. Duguid told the commissioner that he did not believe “anything I could have, let alone actually, said or did as a member of parliament could have had any bearing on the BP share price”. The commissioner decided that Duguid’s repeated failures to declare the interest were “inadvertent” and the result of a misunderstanding about the rules. The commissioner required Duguid to apologise and to attend training on the parliamentary rules on declaration of interests.  Interactive  Tom Brake, the director of Unlock Democracy, said: “The commissioner has underlined the importance of transparency when participating in debates, not just in relation to financial matters that require registration by MPs, but also a broader range of interests, such as sizeable shareholdings held by a family member. “Both MPs and the public will benefit from this ruling. It promotes greater openness and more effective scrutiny.” In January, prior to the conclusion of the investigation, Duguid spoke in a debate on the expansion of offshore oil and gas licences. He acknowledged for the first time in parliament his wife’s shares in BP, saying he wanted to note “in the interests of transparency” that he had a “close family member who has a financial interest in that industry, although I feel keen to point out that that interest is below the threshold required for registering interests”. He added: “I can also assure the house that that interest has never had any bearing, and will not have any bearing, on my contributions in this place.”"

        "content": "Labour’s decision to withdraw support for its candidate at the Rochdale byelection in the wake of controversial comments about the 7 October Hamas attacks has been “shambolic”, the senior lawyer who compiled a report on the party’s culture has said. On Monday, the party withdrew its support for Azhar Ali after the Daily Mail approached Labour with more comments that Ali had made, including a suggestion that Israel deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat. Martin Forde KC was commissioned by Keir Starmer to investigate allegations of bullying, racism and sexism within the party’s ranks after a leaked Labour document made explosive allegations about its handling of antisemitism claims. Forde has said the party’s change in position in response to Ali’s “very inflammatory” and “clearly antisemitic” remarks “appears shambolic”. “It seems to me that the moment that anyone says that the Israeli authorities allowed the atrocities to occur, that has to bring their judgment into question,” Forde told BBC’s Radio 4’s Today programme. “One does have to question how such individuals are selected in the first place and also the disparity in treatment because one of the things that concerned us when we talked about weaponisation was certainly the perception that antisemitism was along factional lines.” When asked if Labour should have withdrawn support Ali at the point the comments first surfaced in the Mail on Sunday, Forde said: “That to me would be the sensible thing to do.” In 2022, Forde published a 139-page report accusing Labour of “operating a hierarchy of racism or of discrimination”. Labour was urged to implement 165 recommendations, many of which the party says it has followed. The report found that under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, antisemitism was often used as a “factional weapon” by his critics and denied by his supporters. It also found that some of the attitudes expressed towards black, Asian and minority ethnic MPs in private WhatsApp messages among staffers hostile to Corbyn represented “over and underlying racism and sexism”. A year after the report’s publication, Forde accused Labour of not taking anti-black racism and Islamophobia as seriously as antisemitism within the party. When asked by the BBC if he thought that someone the Labour leadership did not like was treated more harshly than someone such as Azhar Ali whom it would prefer to give the benefit of the doubt, Forde said: “It’s difficult for me to say that.” He said: “Perception was the thing that concerned myself and the peers that assisted me. If you want a fair and transparent system, it has to deal with people consistently.” After comments Ali had made soon after the 7 October attacks appeared over the weekend, senior party MPs and members urged the leadership to confirm that Ali would be disciplined if he won the byelection. Other Labour MPs and members called the party’s support of Ali a “huge and disappointing shift” from Starmer’s promises of taking a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism and all forms of racism. In line with electoral law, Ali will stand as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper, as the deadline to replace him with another candidate passed on 2 February. If elected, he will not hold the party whip and will sit as an independent MP. Last month, Labour MP Kate Osamor had the whip suspended following comments that Gaza should be remembered as a genocide on Holocaust Memorial Day. Last year, Labour suspended the party whip from Diane Abbott after the MP argued that minority groups - such as Jewish people and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people – faced similar levels of prejudice to people with red hair. Forde added: “I’m aware, from discussions with some of the MPs within the party who might be described as more left-leaning, that they feel when it comes to disciplinary action taken against them, things move rather slowly, but if you’re in the right faction of the party, as it were, then things are either dealt with more leniently or more swiftly.” He said that while this could not be quantified, the party should reassure members and voters that people “will be treated fairly”. Louise Ellman, who resigned from the Labour in 2019 and criticised Corbyn over a “seeming tolerance of antisemitism”, said the party had taken the right decision to withdraw support from Ali. She told Today she thought his comments were “at odds” with her experience of him over the past 20 years, when she said he had consistently spoken out about extremism and antisemitism. “When I looked at his apology, I could see it was a proper apology,” Ellman said. “I think the situation was complicated by the Rochdale byelection and the legal inability to Labour to put a different candidate up.” Andrew Fisher, Labour’s policy director under Corbyn, said Labour’s handling of the matter “reveals a double standard”. “That doesn’t apply to people who are on the left, ever,” Fisher told the BBC. “I think that’s something Martin Forde highlighted as well in his report, which is that these disciplinary processes are used for factional reasons within the Labour party and that results in people like Azhar Ali being given the benefit of the doubt.” Labour has been approached for comment."

        "content": "On the face of it, Britain’s labour market is in rude health. Employment rose in the final three months of 2023 and unemployment fell to 3.8%. Earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose for a sixth successive month. All are traditionally signs of strength – not an economy that may well have been in recession in the second half of last year. Scratch beneath the surface and things look less rosy. The latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that one reason the jobs market is running so hot is because of a lack of workers caused by long-term ill-health. The number of people inactive for health reasons was 2.8 million by the end of 2023 – a rise of more than 200,000 on the year and a jump of 700,000 since before the Covid pandemic. In a literal sense, this is a sick economy.   Related: UK pay growth slows less than expected as workers bid up wages   The absence from the labour market of so many potential workers has consequences. There are still a high number of job vacancies, even though the economy has been flatlining for the best part of two years. While vacancies have been on a downward trend throughout this period, at 932,000 they are still above pre-Covid levels. Employers are also trying to plug the gap by employing more people from overseas. The number of UK-born workers decreased by 312,000 between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023, while the number of foreign-born workers rose by 405,000. Even so, the labour market remains tight and that is reflected in pay. As with vacancies, the rate of earnings growth is coming down – but not as quickly as the Bank of England and the financial markets have expected. Regular private sector wage growth – which is closely watched by Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) – was 6.2% higher in the three months ending in December than in the same period a year earlier. That was down from 6.6% in the three months to November but above the Bank’s forecast of 6%.  Interactive  There are a number of obvious conclusions from the ONS data. One is that employers will oppose measures that would sharply cut the flows of migrant workers into the UK. A second is that there will be pressure on Jeremy Hunt to use next month’s budget to announce measures to tackle long-term sickness. The chancellor may be tempted to tighten benefit rules but was warned against doing so by the Work Foundation, which said welfare cuts risked pushing those dependent on universal credit into low-paid insecure work that would make their underlying health conditions worse. More carrot, less stick was the advice from Ben Harrison, the thinktank’s director. Finally, with private sector earnings growth still running above 6%, the rate-setting MPC is going to be more cautious about cutting interest rates. Wages will not be the only factor in deciding when and by how much borrowing costs come down this year but they are an important part of the mix."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak will announce a series of proposed changes to the planning system on Tuesday to encourage developers to build more homes, in a move designed to boost development in urban areas even while housebuilding slumps nationally. The prime minister and Michael Gove, the housing secretary, will announce a consultation into a package of measures aimed at making it easier for developers to get permission to build on derelict sites in England’s 20 biggest towns and cities. But while some builders have welcomed the move, others in the industry accused the government of trying to deflect from the wider slump in building prompted by Gove’s previous decision to allow local authorities to avoid stringent building targets. Sunak said in a statement: “We pledged to build the right homes in the right places – protecting our precious countryside and building more in urban areas where demand is highest. Today’s package is us delivering on that.” Gove added: “Our new brownfield presumption will tackle under delivery in our key towns and cities – where new homes are most needed to support jobs and drive growth.” Under the proposals, councils would have to approve new development on brownfield land – land which was previously developed but has fallen into disuse – unless they can offer a good reason why they cannot. Limits will also be removed on the kinds of former commercial buildings that can be turned into flats, removing restrictions on how big the building can be before a developer has to apply for planning permission. Ministers will also consult on making it easier for homeowners to extend their houses without seeking planning permission. The last idea has been tried before. The former prime minister David Cameron tried to scrap red tape for single-storey extensions of up to 8 metres long in 2012, in a move criticised as the “conservatory free for all”, but was forced into a U-turn after a backlash from his own MPs. Some housebuilders welcomed the government’s proposed changes, the consultation for which will run until 26 March. David Thomas, the chief executive of Barratt Developments, said: “We welcome any efforts to make it easier to get planning permission, particularly for brownfield regeneration, which is already naturally a more complicated and capital-intensive process.” However, others pointed out that the new construction that would be unlocked by the government’s latest package would be far smaller than the developments that have been lost because of previous changes to the planning system. In December, Gove announced councils would no longer have to abide by strict housing targets set according to predicted population growth, and could allocate less land to development to avoid changing the character of a local area. That move, which was first signalled a year earlier, has resulted in a widespread slump in proposed developments, with many councils choosing to delay, stop or reduce their local housing plans. The number of new dwellings, as calculated by the number of energy performance certificates issued, dropped 9% in 2023 compared with 2022. A spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation said: “Whilst we welcome any moves to bring land through for development more quickly, this consultation announcement will do little to tackle our housing crisis. “If we are to reverse the sharp falls in housing supply we are now seeing, we need some serious joined-up policies, not tinkering around the edges.”"

But under electoral law, Ali will still appear on the ballot as the Labour candidate on Thursday 29 February. What happened? A recording of a meeting of the Lancashire Labour party was leaked to the Mail on Sunday over the weekend, in which Ali was reportedly heard saying Israel had deliberately relaxed security after receiving warnings of the impending attack. Ali apologised “unreservedly to the Jewish community” for the comments, which he acknowledged were “deeply offensive, ignorant and false”. After 36 hours defending Ali, Labour withdrew its support on Monday following further revelations, instructing campaigners in Rochdale to halt leafleting and social media activity on Ali’s behalf. But with the byelection a little over two weeks away, Labour cannot replace him with another candidate. Why can’t Labour replace Ali? Election Commission rules state that a candidate can only withdraw from a race via a withdrawal notice delivered by 4pm, 19 working days before the poll. The deadline for the Rochdale byelection, which will be a key test for Keir Starmer’s party, passed on 2 February. Can a candidate withdraw past the deadline? Nope. “After the withdrawal deadline it is not possible to withdraw from the election, and your name will appear on the ballot paper,” the rules state. “If the election is uncontested, you will be declared elected.” What can a party do? Once the deadline for an election has passed, there is very little a party that wishes to remove a candidate from the ballot can do. They can withdraw their support, as Labour has, and advise constituents to not vote for the candidate – but that candidate will still appear on the ballot paper for the party they were registered with at the deadline. Any postal votes that have already been cast for that candidate are still counted, too. They could also endorse a candidate from a different party. While far from an official position, one local Labour insider said that some activists in Rochdale will seriously consider throwing their support behind Simon Danczuk, the disgraced former Labour MP, in an attempt to prevent a victory for George Galloway, who is running as a Workers party candidate in the byelection. What happens next? Ali will be listed as the Labour candidate on the ballot paper. If elected, however, he will not hold the party whip and will sit as an independent MP."

        "content": "Labour has withdrawn its support for Azhar Ali, its candidate for this month’s Rochdale byelection, in the wake of controversial comments he made about the 7 October attacks on Israel.  In line with electoral law, Labour cannot replace Ali with another candidate because the deadline passed on 2 February. He will stand as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper, but if elected he will not hold the party whip and will sit as an independent MP.   Related: Labour’s self-sabotage leaves Rochdale byelection up for grabs   Labour sources said that campaigners in Rochdale were told to stop leafleting and social media activity on Ali’s behalf at 5.30pm on Monday – an instruction that came from party HQ. Senior party MPs and members had urged the leadership to confirm Ali would be disciplined if he won the byelection, as comments he had made soon after the 7 October attacks surfaced over the weekend. In them, he suggested Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat. The Labour MPs and members voiced their concern at the leadership’s continued support of Ali, saying it marked a “huge and disappointing shift” from Starmer’s promises of taking a “zero-tolerance” approach to antisemitism and all forms of racism. On Monday night, the Daily Mail approached Labour with more comments Ali had made, prompting the party to withdraw its support.  A local Labour insider said that some activists would seriously consider throwing their support behind Simon Danczuk, the disgraced former Labour MP for Rochdale who was suspended from the party after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager. “Simon may be the best way of keeping [George Galloway, who is running as a Workers party candidate in the byelection] out,” a source said. “It’s the devil and the deep blue sea.” Danczuk, who is standing for the populist Reform party, said Labour should now take down posters and rip up leaflets supporting Ali, and ensure their activists no longer campaigned for him. “Labour under Keir Starmer has been campaigning for someone with antisemitic views,” he said. “The party must completely dissociate itself from this candidate. If the party appears to be tacitly supporting him, it will be a disgraceful state of affairs.” Danczuk’s campaign would now concentrate on stopping Galloway, he said. “My campaign will be to tell the electorate that they will not want an MP who would prioritise Palestine over Rochdale. If elected, I will prioritise Rochdale over Palestine.” Galloway, who is concentrating on Rochdale’s sizeable Pakistani and Kashmiri Muslim community for votes, is expected to benefit from the row, with some local activists saying that Ali’s suspension makes him favourite to win on 29 February. The veteran campaigner, who has already been an MP for Respect and Labour, has appealed for voters to help put the plight of the people of Gaza on the map by voting him in. Any prospect that he could enter parliament again will appal some in the Jewish community. In 2014, he called for Bradford to become an “Israel-free zone”. Ali had apologised after a recording was leaked to the Mail on Sunday in which he was heard saying: “The Egyptians are saying that they warned Israel 10 days earlier … Americans warned them a day before [that] … there’s something happening. They deliberately took the security off, they allowed … that massacre that gives them the green light to do whatever they bloody want.” Lisa Nandy, the shadow international development minister, and Anneliese Dodds, the shadow women and equalities secretary, had been out campaigning for Ali in the constituency at the weekend. The shadow minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he believed Ali had fallen “for an online conspiracy theory” and he understood the “gravity of the offence that has been caused”. A frontbencher said: “This came far too late. The leadership’s continued support could still open the floodgates, allowing many others to think they can get away with antisemitism if they have posed with banners calling for an end to antisemitism.” Another senior MP added: “What he said passed the threshold of what is acceptable and, if he was a Labour MP, would necessitate suspension of the whip if recent cases are a guide.” It is understood Ali has also been suspended from the Labour party, pending an investigation. According to a story published by the Daily Mail on Monday night, Ali said “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were “giving crap” about Andy McDonald, who was suspended by Labour after he used the controversial phrase “between the river and the sea” in a speech during a rally. The paper also said the now-former Labour candidate claimed that Israel planned to “get rid of [Palestinians] from Gaza” and “grab” some of the land. It is thought he made the comments at the same meeting as the original story. “Following new information about further comments made by Azhar Ali coming to light today, the Labour party has withdrawn its support for Azhar Ali as our candidate in the Rochdale byelection,” a Labour spokesperson said. “Keir Starmer has changed Labour so that it is unrecognisable from the party of 2019. We understand that these are highly unusual circumstances, but it is vital that any candidate put forward by Labour fully represents its aims and values. Given that nominations have now closed, Azhar Ali cannot be replaced as the candidate.” Rishi Sunak made a direct reference to the scandal during a GB News interview, accusing Starmer of standing by the politician and having “no principles at all”. “So no, the Labour party hasn’t changed,” he said during a one-hour Q&A with a live audience. “It’s a con.” A spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said: “Sir Keir Starmer has blotted an otherwise fairly admirable copy book and given the public reason to doubt the earnestness of his promise to tear antisemitism out ‘by its roots’ in Labour. “People will have to judge for themselves whether the additional reported comments by Azhar Ali are really any worse than the comments that had already been reported. “Rather than appearing as a principled decision, Labour’s withdrawal of support for its candidate at this late stage just looks as expedient as the failed attempt to defend him. It is the worst of all worlds for Labour.” Last year, Martin Forde KC, the senior lawyer commissioned by Starmer to investigate the Labour party’s culture, criticised the leadership for vowing to take a “zero-tolerance” approach to antisemitism and all other forms of racism without having “transparent systems in place”. Calling for an independent directorate to oversee Labour’s disciplinary processes, which has since been rejected, Forde said at the time: “I think part of the reason that factionalism has arisen around this is because there is a perception that different groups are treated differently.” Activists in Rochdale have told of their shock at Ali’s remarks, saying he was known for being an ally and supportive of rooting out antisemitism from the party. They believe this is why the leadership had treated him with sympathy. Kate Osamor, a Labour MP, was suspended in January for saying Gaza should be remembered as a genocide on Holocaust Memorial Day, while McDonald lost the whip in October for telling a pro-Palestine rally: “We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.”"

        "content": "It was the arrival of George Galloway that Labour feared would cause the party the biggest headache in the Rochdale byelection at the end of the month. But in the end it was Labour’s own candidate, the Lancashire county councillor Azhar Ali, who has sabotaged what should have been a safe Labour seat (majority: 9,668) and made a Galloway victory a slightly more likely prospect on 29 February.   Related: Labour withdraws support for Rochdale candidate after Israel-Gaza remarks   Starmer disowned Ali on Monday night, 36 hours after the Mail on Sunday reported leaked remarks in which Ali said the Israeli government deliberately allowed 1,139 of its citizens to be massacred on 7 October in order to give it the “green light” for military action. It initially looked like Ali might survive, with a Jewish Labour grandee, the former Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman, lured out of retirement to say that he was an “ally” of the Jewish community. Starmer had stood by Ali throughout Monday until “further comments” made by Ali came to light, and the party withdrew its support. Thirty-six hours is a long time in politics for a leader who has rebuilt his party’s reputation by operating a zero-tolerance approach to anyone with even the vaguest whiff of antisemitism about them. No doubt Starmer’s judgment will now be questioned, though at least he now avoids being asked constantly why Ali was being allowed to stand between now and the vote on 29 February. So what happens next? Labour has made clear that even if Ali wins he will not be allowed to sit as a Labour MP. Instead, he would join other Labour outcasts including Kate Osamor and Andy McDonald in the odd-squad of independents and will no doubt disappear from parliament after the general election. But his name has already been printed on the postal ballots, alongside Labour’s red rose and party name. To make matters more farcical, last week the Green party candidate withdrew from the Rochdale race after the resurfacing of what he described as his “regrettable” social media remarks about Gaza and Muslims, and yet he too will be listed on the voting slip. Thousands of people will probably still vote for Ali, not out of any personal loyalty – or adherence to the same conspiracy theory that suggested Israel was “in” on the 7 October attacks – but because most people do not pay much attention to any political news. If they vote, they often do so for a party and not an individual. During a two-day visit Rochdale last week, the Guardian encountered just as many constituents who were unaware there was a byelection as those with a view about the contest. This is nothing against the people of Rochdale. Outside Westminster, most people no longer listen devotedly to Radio 4’s Today programme or buy a daily newspaper. With so much streaming entertainment they aren’t glued to the nightly news. So what of Galloway’s chances? He, naturally, senses blood, saying that Labour has “again brought disgrace to Rochdale as they have done so many other times before”. In a video on Monday night he vowed to fight for “every vote, in every part of the community”. But a Galloway victory is not a foregone conclusion. Until now, he has concentrated his campaign solely on Rochdale’s Muslim community, who make up 30% of the local population. Though he is undoubtedly picking up support, at a rally outside a mosque on Friday his campaign team had to encourage the audience to move nearer to the front so that it didn’t look so sparsely attended. Meanwhile Simon Danczuk, Rochdale’s Labour MP between 2010 and 2017, thinks he now is in better stead to win back his old seat for his new party, Reform. “It’s now a fight between Galloway, who will prioritise Palestine, and me, who will prioritise Rochdale,” he said on Monday night. It is true there are significant numbers of voters in Rochdale for whom Gaza is not the main issue. Many remain disgusted at the town’s grooming scandal, with some even saying they were turned off by the thought of voting Labour when they realised a candidate of Pakistani Muslim heritage might be their new MP. Ultimately the vote will probably decided on turnout. The Labour machine is normally peerless on voting day when it comes to getting out the vote, deploying armies of door-knockers right until 10pm, cajoling people out of the house with offers of lifts to the polling station. With that gone, could Galloway prevail? In the early hours of 1 March, all will be revealed."

        "content": "I suppose it was almost inevitable. Nearly every Conservative MP has their own show on GB News, so it was only a matter of time before it was Rishi Sunak’s turn. The prime minister is going to have a free diary after the next election. Perhaps he could do a weekly phone-in show from California. Though the £100,000 he might get for it probably won’t be nearly enough to make ends meet. He paid five times more than that in tax last year. For Rishi’s Big Break on GB News, we got an hour-long Q&A on the People’s Forum – a lucky audience of undecided voters selected by the polling company Survation. “Rishi here,” he gurned in trailers screened throughout the day. “Ask me anything.” Though hopefully not about tax. Sunak didn’t seem that keen to explain why he paid a lower tax rate than most of the rest of the country. On the GB News message board, the first questions started rolling in. “Hedgehog” wanted to know why the Muslims got a special vote in elections. It’s possible Hedgehog hadn’t quite understood what commentators meant when they talked of the Muslim vote. Ray Sellars reckoned there should be daily flights of illegal immigrants to the Falklands. Somehow I didn’t think that question would get selected either. Presenter Stephen Dixon opened the show with a brief welcome and then handed over to Rish!, who proceeded to make his opening remarks with his back to the camera. Not the greatest 60 seconds of television. It’s been a tough few years, Sunak began. Covid. Ukraine. Curiously he didn’t also think to mention Brexit or the Liz Truss budget. Or 14 years of Conservative incompetence. Sunak is getting very forgetful these days. Rish! then moved on to his five priorities. Sorry, your priorities. Yet again, he has merely been doing us all a favour. Mumble, mumble, mumble. So as we could all see – well, we might have done if we had been able to hear properly – he was actually delivering on all five of his priorities. Everything was working perfectly. We had never had it so good. “I can offer change,” he concluded. Let’s run through this again. You can offer change from yourself and your government. That’s very big of you. On to the first question. David from Darlington. Tell us one thing of any substance you’ve actually done. Rish! bounced into life. He had been to Darlington. Once. Never again. But he loved the north. That’s why he had levelled it up. Teesside was going brilliantly. Apart from the reports that said there were financial concerns. He finished off by lying about freeports. Next. Alex from London. Why was the NHS falling apart? Sunak wiped away an imaginary tear. He came from an NHS family, which was why he was determined never to use the NHS again. The doctors were all a bunch of greedy bastards who didn’t know a good deal when they were offered it. The Tories had given the NHS record funding. Though they do seem to have gone quiet on the imaginary 40 new hospitals they had promised to build. Keith from Edinburgh wanted to know what was happening with social care. So too did Rishi. He suggested it was a problem for local government. Nothing to do with him. On to Linda from Middleton. Why was he so adamant about Rwanda? Everyone knew it wasn’t going to work. Now Rish! got all down with the people. Keepin’ it real for GB News. He started dropping his consonants and introducing glottal stops into his sentences. “Stoppin’ the li-ull boats.” Rishi. The Millionaire of the People. The authen-ic voice of yoof. It was sad. Pathetic even. Tryin desperately to fi’ in. Then he had nothing to say. Other than Rwanda would be a deterrent. He didn’t seem to grasp the difference between sending Albanians to Albania and Afghan refugees to Rwanda. He even tried to blame Labour for stopping him. This is a man who takes no responsibility for his own legislation failing to comply with international law. There was a brief interruption from John who was furious about the Covid vaccine compensation scheme. “Look me in the eye, Rishi Sunak,” he barked. If it was all the same, Rish! would rather not. He’s not a man who handles confrontation well. Jake from York wondered what Sunak could offer disillusioned Tory voters like him to stop him voting Reform. It was at this point we realised that the undecided voters were not primarily those torn between Tory and Labour. This was a GB News audience after all. Robin wanted to know what the Conservatives could offer people who were LGBT. Rish! looked horrified. Why should he offer them anything? He was fed up with being inclusive. Hell, what was the country coming to these days. You couldn’t even make a trans joke in front of the mother of a murdered trans teenager without the Labour thought police being on your case. Housebuilding was on the mind of 19-year-old Josh from Shrewsbury. There was nowhere to live. Rish! flicked the switch marked empathy. He felt Josh’s pain. He wanted Josh to be able to buy a house like he had. All it would take was for Josh to make his first million as a hedge fund manager for Goldman Sachs betting against sterling. That was the patriotic thing to do. Josh looked understandably deflated. He got the message. He was never going to have his own home. And that was just about it. An hour that had passed quite quickly. If totally pointlessly. Because we hadn’t learned any more about Rish! than we already knew. That he’s just not very good at this sort of thing. He can’t connect with people. He lives in a parallel world to the rest of us. Whatever the questions, he gives the same boilerplate answers. He doesn’t believe what he’s saying, so why should we? He’s merely going through the motions. Someone should have a word. For his sanity as well as ours. It’s going to be a long eight months. Not all of us are going to get out of it alive."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has said he is “absolutely committed” to his Rwanda policy during a one-hour Q&A session on GB News in which he insisted he understands the country’s frustrations after 14 years of Conservative-led government. The prime minister told voters that the Rwanda deportations scheme was necessary as a “deterrent” to channel crossings. Sunak was asked by a voter at the GB News People’s Forum why he was “so adamant” about sticking to the Rwanda policy “when public documentation shows it isn’t working and that it’s not going to work”. Sunak said: “In order to fully solve this problem, we need a deterrent. We need to be able to say pretty simply and unequivocally that if you come to our country illegally, you won’t get to stay. “We want to be able to remove you either to your home country if it’s safe, like we’ve done with Albania, and for everyone else we need an alternative and that’s what Rwanda is about. “I’m absolutely committed to getting this bill through parliament and getting this scheme up and running.” He challenged Labour and the House of Lords to back the bill, saying: “We are committed to getting it through parliament, but unfortunately, we don’t have a majority in the House of Lords. “Everyone else right now as we speak is lining up to do deals in the House of Lords to block us … We’ve already seen that in the Commons.” Asked by one voter why traditional Conservative supporters should back Sunak and not the Nigel Farage-linked Reform UK, Sunak said he appreciated people’s “frustration”. “I think fundamentally, what you want and what I want are the same,” he said. “The next election is a straightforward choice. At the end of it, either Keir Starmer or I am going to be prime minister and a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate is simply a vote to put Keir Starmer into No 10.” But in a sign he is thinking about his next career after Downing Street, Sunak suggested he “won’t be around” in politics in 14 years’ time. Speaking about his record on the NHS, the prime minister said: “I probably will not be around in the 14 years that it takes to train the consultant that we’re now starting to invest in, but it’s the right long-term thing to do for our country, which is why I’ve done it.” He appealed to undecided voters to support him to help see through his policies. “There’s more to do and that’s what the election this year is about. That’s the choice,” he said. “Do we stick with this plan? Our plan that is starting to deliver the change that you will want and the country deserves. Or do we go back to square one with Keir Starmer and the Labour party?” “Now we’ve just seen in the last week, with absolute chaos over the £28bn decarbonisation policy, that Labour simply don’t have a plan – and if you don’t have a plan, you can’t deliver any change.” Sunak also accused Starmer of attacking him over his privileged background and private schooling, and said that was “not British”. “I get attacked by Keir Starmer because of where I went to school,” he said. “You’re not really attacking me, you’re attacking my parents, and you’re attacking everybody like them that works hard to aspire for a better life for them and their family. I think that’s wrong. I don’t think it’s British. And that’s not the type of country that I’m going to build.”"

Thank you for tuning in to the liveblog today. \n\nRishi Sunak went on GBNews’s People’s Forum, where he fielded questions on everything from the NHS, Rwanda, trans issues and education. He spoke at length about the upcoming election, beseeching voters to stand by the conservative government and vote for him instead of Keir Starmer. \nSunak stood by the Rwanda bill, which was being debated today in the House of Lords. He said he is “absolutely” committed to getting the Rwanda bill through Parliament because “we need a deterrent”. “We need to say unequivocally that if you come to our country illegally, you cannot stay,” he said. “That is what Rwanda is about.”\nMinutes before Sunak went live, the Labour party withdrew its support for its candidate in the Rochdale byelection after he accused Israel of deliberately allowing the 7 October Hamas attacks.\nWhile Sunak fielded questions, protesters amassed outside Downing Street, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “Rishi Sunak, shame on you. Keir Starmer, shame on you,” they chanted. \n\n\n\nLoud chanting outside Downing Street right now.'Rishi Sunak, shame on you.

It is a bill we should not even be asked to confront, let alone pass.”\n\nUpdated at 5.36pm GMT\n\n\n 4.47pm GMT \n\nLord Falconer of Thoroton is arguing that this bill “fundamentally crosses over the separation of powers” and would set a bad precedent for the country’s future. \n“Do not listen to this siren song that this is not a fundamental change in our constitution – it is and it will be the foundation of many bad things to come,” he said. \n\n\n\n 4.23pm GMT \n\nPA Media has some fuller quotes of what former Conservative party leader Michael Howard said in the House of Lords on the proposed amendments of the Rwanda deportation plans. He was speaking against a series of amendments that Shami Chakrabarti, the archbishop of Canterbury and Brenda Hale have put their names to, and specifically about their point that the UNHCR should play some role in advising the secretary of state on Rwanda. He said:\n\nThe plain fact is that we are a parliamentary democracy. That means that parliament is sovereign, and the reason why so many of us cherish that overarching principle is that we attach high importance to something called accountability.\nAccountability was not a word which featured very large in your Lordships debate on second reading. The courts are accountable to no one, they proudly proclaim that fact; many of the bodies to which parliament in recent years outsourced some of its responsibilities have little if any accountability; but parliament itself – or at least the other place, the House of Commons in which I was privileged to serve for 27 years – is truly accountable.\nTo whom is the UN high commissioner for refugees accountable? Perhaps they might say to the general assembly of the United Nations. To whom is that body accountable? The acceptance of these amendments would constitute nothing less than an abdication of the responsibilities of Government.”\n\nHe was responding to Chakrabarti, who opened the debate by saying the Bill as it stands “threatens both the domestic rule of law, especially the separation of powers, and the international rules-based order”.\nShe said:\n\nI will assume that the government does not want to put the executive of the UK on a collision course with our supreme court or our international legal obligations. So amendments in this group seek to offer a way through the stalemate for people of good will from all sides of your Lordships House\n\nShe said the proposals would mean no one was removed to Rwanda under the Government’s plans “unless two conditions are met”.\nShe added: “The first condition is that there is advice from the UNHCR that Rwanda is now safe, for example as a result of the successful implementation of promised reforms and safeguards to the asylum system there. The second condition is that this advice has been laid before both Houses of Parliament.”\n\nThat is it from me Martin Belam, for today. It has been quite the crash course in the Guardian style guide of how we address peers, that is for sure. I am handing over to my colleague Vivian Ho now. I will be back with you again tomorrow while Andrew Sparrow enjoys a well-deserved break.\n\n\n\n\n 4.06pm GMT \n\nChristopher Chessun, Bishop of Southwark, says “we cannot afford to get this wrong” and that courts and tribunals must be able to make the judgment on the safety of Rwanda, not have it set in stone by legislation. He says the government is taking “an unreasonable risk” by currently sending people to Rwanda.\n\n\n\n 4.02pm GMT \n\nArminka Helic, appointed to the Lords by David Cameron in 2014, has said that the inclusion of a role in the process of adjudicating the safety of Rwanda or otherwise to UNHCR would show a valuable signal of the UK’s commitment to international bodies.\n\n\n\n 3.52pm GMT \n\nLord Howard of Lympne has gone on to argue that the supreme court ruling was not a “finding of fact” but a “finding of opinion” which fair-minded people could disagree on. He also said that none of the amendements were signed by Labour frontbench peers, and that did not surprise him, as he said no party aiming for government would put their name to them.\nBaroness Meacher spoke to raise concerns that the Bar Council has concerns that the law is in opposition to the ECHR.\nBaroness Hamwee has said “it goes against the grain” for a Liberal Democrat like herself to say that the Bill only needs “small tweaks”.\n\n\n\n 3.44pm GMT \n\nThe list of amendments being proposed in the House of Lords to the government’s Rwanda bill are available here.\nBaroness Chakrobati has argued that the government has nothing to fear from the amendments, if Rwanda is indeed a safe country.\nFormer Conservative party leader, Lord Howard of Lympne, is speaking next. He is arguing against the amendments, saying that in the Lords chamber at the second reading there was little mention of “accountability”. He seems to be arguing that courts have extended their powers, and that the amendments would further erode the accountability of the House of Commons. He is arguing that the UNHCR, mentioned in the amendment, has no accoutability within the UK.\n\n\n\n 3.36pm GMT \n\nBaroness Chakrabarti says that despite her own personal objection to transporting people for processing, she is approaching the amendments in a spirit of constitutional compromise, to seek a way through the stalemate.\n\n\n\n 3.33pm GMT \nHouse of Lords opens committee stage on government's Rwanda deportation bill\n\nBaroness Chakrabarti is opening the committee debate in the House of Lords on Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill. She says the debate on the amendments is on a fundamental dispute of facts, and that the government is undermining the rule of law and order as “the executive seeks to overturn the recent judicial factual determination.”\nThere is a video feed here, and you will shortly be able to get a feed at the top of the blog.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.30pm GMT \n\nDavid Cameron has become the first Cabinet minister to explicitly criticise remarks made by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump about Nato. Trump’s suggestion that the US would not protect Nato allies failing to spend enough on defence was “not a sensible approach”, the foreign secretary said.\nPA Media quotes Cameron saying:\n\nI am a very strong supporter of Nato. It is what helps to keep us safe and that is so essential in this world where we have seen Putin’s terrible illegal invasion of Ukraine.\nAnd actually Nato this year has got stronger, with Sweden and Finland joining. Of course we want all countries, like us, to spend 2%, but I think what was said was not a sensible approach.\n\nCameron added that Nato was “more essential than ever” in “this very dangerous and uncertain world that we live in” and that it was not “responsible or sensible to say some of the things that have been said”. At the weekend Trump said he would “encourage” Russia to attack any of the US’s Nato allies whom he considers to have not met their financial obligations.\n\n\n\n 3.25pm GMT \n\nBefore the Rwanda discussion, the House of Lords has a question on Royal Navy aircraft carriers.\nIt has been confirmed that HMS Prince of Wales has sailed to replace HMS Queen Elizabeth in Nato exercises. The Earl of Minto is responding for the government. Baroness Janke has said that the state of the aircraft carriers should be a source of “national shame”.\nEarlier today security minister Tom Tugendhat suggested it was “not acceptable” that aircraft carriers were sitting in dock when they should be out “defending our interests abroad.”\nIn its announcement that HMS Prince of Wales has sailed, the Royal Navy quotes defence secretary Grant Shapps saying: “I would like to congratulate the crew of HMS Prince of Wales for their hard work and dedication in rapidly preparing the ship for departure. The ability to deploy hundreds of crew to make ready one of the world’s most complex aircraft carriers within a week is testament to the skill and ability of the Royal Navy.”\nLords have criticised the armed forces for the procurement process involved in building the ships, and criticised the navy’s risk management processes.\n\nUpdated at 3.26pm GMT\n\n\n 3.09pm GMT \n\nLord Clement-Jones is asking in the House of Lords about reform of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, which is the last question on the order paper before debate is due to start on the government’s Rwanda deportation plan.\n\n\n\n 3.07pm GMT \n\nScotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law were trapped in the early stages of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, has criticised both Keir Starmer and prime minister Rishi Sunak for their failure to call for a ceasefire.\nIn a social media post, quoting news that SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has written to the pair over the issue, Yousaf said:\n\nKeir Starmer and Sunak’s unwillingness to call for an immediate ceasefire will never be forgotten, nor forgiven. The UK government and Labour opposition should hang their heads in shame as we witness a massacre that is killing thousands of women & children in front of our very eyes.\n\n\n\n\n 2.38pm GMT \n\nThe House of Lords has just started sitting. After oral questions, which is down on the order paper for 40 minutes, they should move on to considering the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill. There is a live stream here if you’d like to watch.\n\n\n\n 2.05pm GMT \n\nThe Conservatives are continuing to home in on the Labour party over comments by Rochdale byelection candidate Azhar Ali.\nThe party social media account has fallen back to a frequently used PMQs attack line from Rishi Sunak, that the current Labour leader supported the previous Labour leader during election campaigns, writing:\n\nLabour have admitted that Keir Starmer’s candidate for Rochdale spouted an antisemitic conspiracy theory. But today they’re still fully behind him and campaigning for him to be their MP. Remember: Keir Starmer is the same man that backed Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister.\n\nHome secretary James Cleverly has also attacked comments made earlier by Labour party shadow minister without portfolio, Nick Thomas-Symonds, who said Ali had fallen for a conspiracy theory. Cleverly wrote:\n\nI’m not sure ‘our candidate believed and repeated a vile and clearly antisemitic smear that he saw on the internet’ is quite the defence that Labour think it is.\n\n\n\n\n 1.57pm GMT \n\nPhilip Nye at the Institute for Government has this wallchart of the MPs who have already announced they will not be standing for re-election later this year, which is now 90 in total, of which 57 are Conservative MPs.\n\n\nTracey Crouch, former sport minister and Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford, has announced she will be standing down at the next electionThat takes to 90 the total number of announcements we've had so far, of which 57 are from Conservative MPshttps://t.co/QywsumNvac pic.twitter.com/jNOHIcM93w— Philip Nye (@philipnye) February 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.48pm GMT \n\nThe prime minister’s spokesperson has said that Rishi Sunak believes Ofwat is doing a good job of regulating water companies in England.\nSpeaking earlier today, the spokesperson said “of course” Sunkak thinks the regulator is doing a good job, “but we have also recognised that there have been significant challenges in this sector. So that is why we are taking further action, not least today in giving Ofwat the powers they need to ban water bosses from receiving bonuses in scenarios where a company has committed serious criminal breaches, which I think the public would expect”.\nThe environment secretary, Steve Barclay, is proposing to block payouts to executives of firms that commit criminal acts of water pollution, starting with bonuses in the 2024-25 financial year from April. Bosses took home more than £26m in bonuses, benefits and incentives over the last four years, despite illegally dumping vast amounts of sewage in waterways.\nOfwat has also announced that a new scheme to fine water companies for providing poor service to customers, although it has been dismissed as “nothing less than a gimmick” by Liberal Democrats who have been campaigning on the issue.\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm GMT\n\n\n 1.41pm GMT \n\nThe Northern Ireland assembly is sitting in Stormont today, with a Sinn Féin motion on childcare costs to be debated. Unlike England, Scotland and Wales there is no free childcare provision in the country.\nDeputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly (DUP), speaking on the BBC yesterday, said she was glad there was cross-party support to make a plan, and suggested that actually it was an advantage to be able to learn from mistakes made in other areas of the UK. “The DUP had set out a 30-hours free childcare promise but that doesn’t mean it’s a cut and paste from the English system,” she said.\nBefore that, in the assembly there was some confirmation of the allocation of the chairs and deputy chairs of all the Stormont committees, and this has angered Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, and its only representative in the Northern Ireland assembly.\nHe claims he has been deliberately excluded from the committee working on post-Brexit arrangements and the Windsor framework. PA Media quotes him saying:\n\nLast week we had a carve-up by the main parties and then an offer of the crumbs to the four of us in this corner of the assembly. And of course crumbs which didn’t meet any of the desires of those of us sent here on an equal mandate with everyone else.\nThe result of course, in my own case … I have been denied a place on the EU Brexit committee because deep-dive scrutiny is not what is required; rather it is the form rather than the substance of scrutiny that the protocol-implementing parties in this House wish to see.\nOn that committee or not, elsewhere I will continue to shine a light on to the dark deeds of colonial rule from the EU in this place.\n\nThe committee, which is to meet for the first time on Thursday, is charged with examining and considering new EU Acts and replacement Acts as they arise, and it can recommend the application of the Stormont brake to the UK Government.\n\nUpdated at 1.56pm GMT\n\n\n 1.27pm GMT \n\nCrouch is the eighth MP – and the sixth Conservative – this year to announce they will quit Parliament at the next election, which is expected to take place later in 2024.\nOverall, more than 80 MPs – of whom more than 50 are Conservatives – have already said they intend to stand down then. That is more than retired at the 2019 election and almost as many as retired in 2015.\nIn her resignation letter, Crouch says she will “continue to work tirelessly for my constituents” until the election, and looks forward to supporting whoever is selected as the Conservative candidate for her relatively safe seat.\nIn 2021, she chaired the review of football governance in England triggered by the backlash to the short-lived proposals to form a European Super League. The review had been promised in the 2019 Conservative manifesto following the collapse of Bury FC.\nAmong the recommendations were the creation of an independent football regulator to oversee financial regulation of the men’s professional game and the imposition of a “stamp duty” on transfers between Premier League clubs.\n\n\n\n 12.53pm GMT \n\nThe UK has sanctioned four extremist Israeli settlers who have committed human rights abuses against Palestinian communities in the West Bank, the Foreign Office says.\n\n\n\n 12.33pm GMT \n\nTracey Crouch, the Conservative MP for Chatham & Aylesford, has become the latest MP to announce they are standing down at the next election.\nIn a statement she said her reasons for not wishing to stand are “entirely personal and positive.”\nCrouch, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, and in 2023 reached the summit of Kilimanjaro while raising funds for a breast cancer charity, said:\n\nWhile everyone’s cancer journey is different, for me going through a diagnosis and coming out the other side of treatment has been a life affirming experience. It has been an opportunity to pause and reflect on my own personal priorities, and based on that, I truly believe it is time to seek a new professional challenge. We spend far too much time in our relatively short lives putting things off but at some point, you have to say to yourself if not now, when and for me I have realised that when is now.\n\n\n\nA bit of personal news... pic.twitter.com/pE5huBwiEt— Tracey Crouch (@tracey_crouch) February 12, 2024\n\n\nThe former sports minister resigned from government in 2018 because she believed pro-gambling MP Philip Davies successfully went above her head to secure a delay to curbs on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), defying her on a policy she had overseen.

You’ve got to make sure you can’t get in a boat, arrive in Britain and stay in Britain. Rwanda is a safe country in our view.\n\nThe Lords begins its committee stage scrutinising the Bill at 3.20pm today, and has published 38 pages of potential amendments in advance. [See 9.43am GMT]\n\n\n\n 11.43am GMT \n\nJames Cleverly, meanwhile, has also added to the social media pressure on Labour’s candidate for the Rochdale byelection, reposting a message that asked how Labour could still be supporting Azhar Ali’s candidacy when the party had withdrawn the whip from Kate Osamor and Andy McDonald over comments which included references to Gaza the party had deemed offensive or controversial.\nOsamor, the MP for Edmonton, appeared to have said Gaza should be remembered as a genocide on Holocaust memorial day, and McDonald was placed on a “precautionary suspension” after a Labour party spokesperson said comments he made that included the words “between the river and the sea” at a pro-Palestine rally were “deeply offensive”. McDonald subsequently threatened legal action against Conservative MP Chris Clarkson for defamation after Clarkson commented.\nDiane Abbott, herself also suspended by the Labour party after comments in a letter to the Observer about racism, has added pressure on Keir Starmer’s stance over a ceasefire in Gaza this morning. Quoting Starmer’s message yesterday in which he said “an Israeli offensive [in Rafah] would be catastrophic”, she said:\n\nSurely the decision for Labour to oppose a ceasefire was a mistake, then? An apology is called for and the party should vote for immediate ceasefire at the first opportunity. Otherwise, this is fraudulent. Just hot air before a tricky byelection.\n\n\n\n\n 11.32am GMT \n\nOn the government’s media grid this morning was the launch of a new anti-fraud campaign, which was being championed by home secretary James Cleverly and security minister Tom Tugendhat.\nDescribing the new campaign as “a powerful tool”, Cleverly said that as well as the campaign, the government was delivering “a world-first agreement from tech firms to prevent online fraud and the rollout of a national fraud squad that has 400 expert investigators.”\nThe campaign website – Stop! Think Fraud – can be found here.\n\n\n💻 Fraud costs the taxpayer an estimated £6.8 billion per year.  Our new campaign takes the fight to criminals, giving you the skills to spot fraud and protect you from its devastating impacts.— Home Office (@ukhomeoffice) February 12, 2024\n\n\nDuring the morning media round, Tugendhat cautioned that “fraud ruins lives”, while also claiming that the Conservative givernment he was representing was wrong to write off £4.3bn in fraudulent Covid loans. [See 9.58am GMT]\nLabour’s Emily Thornberry was somewhat less impressed, with the shadow attorney general pointing out the government had overseen a near eightfold increase in the crime, adding that “After 14 years spent sleepwalking through the escalation of the crisis, launching an ad campaign in response is the definition of too little, too late.”\n\nUpdated at 11.34am GMT\n\n\n 11.13am GMT \nSunak: scrapping northern leg of HS2 has benefited local bus routes\n\nDuring his visit to Harrogate this morning, Rishi Sunak has claimed that local buses have benefited from his government’s decisions to scrap the northern leg of HS2.\nPA Media reports the said:\n\nEvery penny from HS2 in the North, almost £20bn, is going to stay in the North. We’re here at a bus depot, which is benefiting from the £2 bus fare that we were able to put in place as a result of the reprioritisation.\nLocal road schemes across the North, railway stations being reopened – those are the types of the projects I think people want us to invest in alongside road maintenance, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.\n\nSunak said “Talking to the team here, as a result of that policy, they’ve seen a 15% increase in bus numbers in this area – I’m here in Harrogate, in North Yorkshire. That demonstrates that policy is working and the plans we’ve put in place are the right ones.”\nThe prime minister said the £2 bus fare cap was a direct result of his decision on HS2. The initial three month cap came into effect in January 2023, with the Department for Transport saying the average fare for a three-mile journey was about £2.80, meaning that passengers would save 30% of the price every time they travelled.\nSunak announced the scrapping of the northern leg of HS2 in October 2023. Last week the public accounts committee of MPs said the remaining London-Birmingham line will be “very poor value for money” and the government does not yet understand how the remaining £67bn high-speed line will now function as a railway.\n\n\n\n 11.13am GMT \n\nPolice have announced they will take no further action against Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell after he was arrested on suspicion of rape, sexual assault and misconduct in a public office. Scotland Yard said a “thorough investigation” had been carried out and the evidence threshold for criminal prosecution had not been met. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Romford MP said he had been “completely exonerated”.\n\n\n\n 10.29am GMT \n\nI must confess that if I was looking for “woke extremists” myself, then the British armed forces would be unlikely to be my first port of call, but the idea has gripped defence secretary Grant Shapps, who has complained that “time and resources are being squandered to promote a political agenda which is pitting individuals against each other” because “there is a woke culture that has seeped into public life over time and is poisoning the discourse.”\nHe has ordered a review of diversity and inclusion policies at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after it was reported that the army wants to relax security checks for overseas recruits to increase black, Asian and minority ethnic representation.\nThe Telegraph is also spluttering today that it has uncovered “93 diversity networks including 10 for gender issues” within the MoD, some of whom have put posters up, and have online messageboards to discuss staff issues including race, gender and mental health. The MoD has about 60,000 civilian employees, and the armed forces consist of about 185,000 people.\nSecurity minister Tom Tugendhat has been drawn into the debate during the morning media round, telling GB News:\n\nThis is a time when only our enemies want us to be divided and we have absolutely no time for this – sort of putting ideology before security. It is absolutely clear, and let me be totally clear, there is no way we are going to be easing up security requirements for ideological requests. That is simply not going to happen.\nYou know, the British armed forces have one purpose and one purpose alone, and that’s to defend the British people and bring death to the king’s enemies. There’s no way we’re going to be putting ideology before security.\n\n\n\n\n 10.11am GMT \n\nA few more quotes from shadow minister without portfolio Nick Thomas-Symonds who was out defending Labour’s Rochdale candidate on the broadcast round this morning. Azhar Ali has apologised after a recording emerged of hi, suggesting that Israel allowed Hamas’s 7 October attacks to take place to provide grounds to invade Gaza.\nAsked whether the incident reflected a problem at large with the Labour party in Rochdale, Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve got, as I understand it, a short clip from a meeting, so I think it would be unfair to draw a wider conclusion in that way. Let me first say the remarks that have been made are completely and utterly unacceptable. I was very shocked and appalled to see them and they in no way represent the views of the Labour party.”\nLabour recently suspended the MP Kate Osamor after she appeared to say the Gaza war should be remembered as genocide on Holocaust Memorial Day.\nOn Sky News, Thomas-Symonds was pressed about whether, should he win in Rochdale, Ali would be allowed to stand again by the party later in the year at a general election, but wouldn’t be drawn, saying “we are all subject” to a selection process for that.\n\n\nLabour under fire for standing by Rochdale candidate @CllrAzharAli The deadline to replace him as candidate for this month's by-election has passed, but will they stand by him in the general election?We ask Labour's @NickTorfaen#KayBurley PO pic.twitter.com/86zpI3AGsG— Kay Burley (@KayBurley) February 12, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.52pm GMT\n\n\n 9.58am GMT \nMinister: writing off £4.3bn in fraudulent Covid loans by government was 'unacceptable'\n\nThe writing off of £4.3bn in fraudulent Covid loans by the Conservative government was “unacceptable” a Tory cabinet minister has said, suggesting more should have been done to tackle fraud during the pandemic.\nTom Tugendhat, the security minister, has been touring the broadcasters to push the government’s announcement of new anti-fraud measures this morning. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he described as an “extremely good point” the suggestion it would be better to rethink now how Covid fraud was addressed.\n\nThe point I’m making is that £4.3bn is an awful lot of money. And, frankly, this is a completely unacceptable outcome for the British people.\n\nIn 2022, HMRC figures showed fraudulent claims for furlough and other business relief schemes had resulted in a loss of an estimated £5.8bn. Of that, £4.3bn was written off. The scandal led to the resignation of the anti-fraud minister Theodore Agnew, who called the oversight of the scheme “nothing less than woeful” and accused officials of “schoolboy errors” on multiple fronts.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords at the time, he accused the government of “arrogance, indolence and ignorance” in its attitude to tackling fraud estimated to cost £29bn a year.\n\n\n\n 9.52am GMT \n\nRishi Sunak has insisted the economy “has turned a corner”, despite the anticipation that official figures this week will show a rise in inflation and that the country has been in a “technical recession”.\nSpeaking to reporters while visiting a bus depot in Harrogate, Sunak said:\n\nAt the start of this year I really believe the economy has turned a corner and we are heading in the right direction. You can see inflation has come down from 11% to 4%, mortgage rates are starting to come down, wages have been rising consistently now.\n\nHe said recent years had been “undoubtedly difficult”, PA Media reports. \n“What is a technical recession?”, I hear some of you ask. The ONS defines it as “two consecutive quarters of negative growth”, with Darren Morgan, ONS Director of Economic Statistics saying “You could get a -0.1% or +0.1% change, but how different really was the economy at that point in time? I would say it was broadly flat, but some people do get excited about it.”\n\n\n\n 9.43am GMT \n\nBack to Rishi Sunak’s week for a moment, we know that he has already acknowledged that he has failed to keep his promise to cut healthcare waiting lists in England, with the situation worsening under his watch. Official figures on Thursday will show whether the UK slipped into recession, despite Sunak’s promise to grow the economy, the day after an anticipated rise in inflation is announced.\nChief secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott, fresh from her tricky appearance with Radio 4’s PM presenter Evan Davis last week, told the Sunday Times: “There will be bumps in the road and on Wednesday we can expect inflation to slightly increase when data for January is published.”\nUK inflation rose unexpectedly to 4.0% in December in the first increase for ten months. The Bank of England target is 2%.\nThe main challenge today for Sunak however is the House of Lords beginning its committee consideration of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill.\nThere are 38 pages of amendments to be debated, including moves that would insert into the bill clauses that require positive UNHCR advice on the safety of Rwanda to be laid before parliament before claims for asylum in the UK may be processed in Rwanda, would seek that the House of Commons have to reassert that Rwanda is still a “safe country” every six months, and delay any possible deportations until after all the clauses of the separate UK-Rwanda treaty, which require some reforms on Rwanda’s part, are implemented.\n\n\n\n 9.31am GMT \n\nA quick scoot around the newspaper front pages.

I would say we were expecting a quiet week in UK politics with most of our institutions – including Andrew Sparrow – enjoying a half-term break, but there are significant political headwinds gathering for both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer.\nSunak faces the prospect of potentially losing two byelections in Kingswood and Wellingborough later this week. Before that his flagship Rwanda deportation plan faces scrutiny in the Lords this afternoon, inflation figures are due out midweek, and Thursday’s GDP figures might show the country has been in a recession. He is out campaigning in Yorkshire today, and will sit through a one hour grilling from voters on GB News at 8pm, which will be another test of how well he is likely to hold up in contact with the public during an election campaign.\nIt is the Rochdale byelection on 29 February that is giving Starmer a headache, with George Galloway threatening the party’s votes from the left with his uncompromising stand over Gaza and Palestine, while Labour try to work out how to handle comments by candidate Azhar Ali back in October suggesting that Israel might have let the Hamas attack happen on purpose in order to justify significant military intervention. Shadow minister without portfolio Nick Thomas-Symonds has been having an uncomfortable time on the morning media round as a result.\nHere are the headlines …\n\nLabour’s candidate for the Rochdale byelection has “apologised unreservedly” to the Jewish community after comments emerged in which he claimed Israel had let the 7 October attacks happen. He remains the party’s candidate.\nA damning parliamentary report has said the UK government’s controversial Rwanda legislation that deems the African country as a safe place to deport people to is fundamentally incompatible with Britain’s human rights obligations and places it in breach of international law.\nUK workers can expect smaller pay rises this year, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) has said.\nMore than 1.5 million patients in England had to wait 12 hours or longer in A&E in the past year.\nDefence secretary Grant Shapps has ordered a review of Ministry of Defence diversity policies.\n\nThe Commons is in recess. The Lords is sitting from 2.30pm, and the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill will begin its committee stage there at 3,20pm. The Senedd and the Scottish parliament are not sitting. In Stormont there is a plenary session from noon.\nIt is Martin Belam here with you this week. I do try to read and dip into the comments when I can, but if you want to get my attention the best way is to email me – martin.belam@theguardian.com – especially if you have spotted an error or typo.\n\n"

        "content": "Keir Starmer has been urged to confirm disciplinary action for Labour’s Rochdale byelection candidate, Azhar Ali, if he becomes an MP, after he apologised for comments made about the Israel-Gaza conflict. Some Labour MPs and members have voiced their concern at the leadership’s continued support of Ali and his campaign, saying it marks a “huge and disappointing shift” from Starmer’s promises of taking a “zero-tolerance” to antisemitism, and all forms of racism. Ali, an adviser to the last Labour government on anti-extremism who worked for the Home Office from 2005 to 2010, sparked dismay and anger within the party on Sunday as comments he had made soon after the 7 October attacks surfaced. In them, he suggested Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat. “The Egyptians are saying that they warned Israel 10 days earlier … Americans warned them a day before [that] … there’s something happening,” Ali was heard saying in a recording obtained by the Mail on Sunday. “They deliberately took the security off, they allowed … that massacre that gives them the green light to do whatever they bloody want.” A frontbencher told the Guardian: “The leadership’s continued support could open the floodgates, allowing many others to think they can get away with antisemitism if they have posed with banners calling for an end to antisemitism without facing a reckoning. “The leadership must remove the whip from him if he wins and say they will conduct an investigation.” Another senior MP added: “What he said passes the threshold of what is acceptable and if he was a Labour MP would necessitate suspension of the whip if recent cases are a guide. So there needs to be indication of future action. “I know there’s a political argument about [George Galloway, who is running as a Workers party candidate in the byelection], however going back to EHRC politics cannot prejudice how we deal with antisemitism issues.” One Labour MP acknowledged the leadership’s difficult position and suggested Starmer was picking the “lesser of two evils”, adding: “Yes, Azhar Ali’s comments were bad. Way worse than Kate Osamor’s comments, but Galloway in parliament would be so much worse for the Jewish community.” They said Labour’s handling of the issue “proves that Labour runs its disciplinary process down factional lines”. Last year, Martin Forde KC, the senior lawyer commissioned by Starmer to investigate the Labour party’s culture, criticised the leadership for vowing to take a “zero-tolerance” approach to antisemitism and all other forms of racism without having “transparent systems in place”. Calling for an independent directorate to oversee Labour’s disciplinary processes, which has since been rejected, Forde said at the time: “I think part of the reason that factionalism has arisen around this is because there is a perception that different groups are treated differently.” Senior party activists have sought to justify the leadership’s reasoning for standing by Ali, citing his “sincere and full apology”. “When you look at his apology and his track record on stamping out antisemitism you can see his apology is sincere,” one said. Activists in Rochdale have told of their shock at Ali’s remarks, saying he was known for being an ally and supportive of rooting out antisemitism from the party. They believe this is why the leadership has treated him with sympathy. Osamor remains on suspension alongside Andy McDonald, who lost the whip in October for using the controversial phrase “between the river and the sea” at a pro-Palestine rally. Labour insiders will hope the row will go unnoticed by voters. In Rochdale, however, Graham and Susan Whitehead, 73 and 74, called Ali’s comment “completely unwarranted”. “We certainly wouldn’t vote for him,” says Graham. “We’ve not voted for Labour before. We’ve voted for various other parties but not for Labour.” In the Milkstone and Deeplish ward, which is 72% Muslim according to the 2021 census, Razia Shamin, a lifelong Labour voter, said she was “disappointed”. “I moved here during the 1960s, and have been canvassing for the Labour party since 1966,” she says. “However, this time I am disappointed because of how the Labour leader is with the Israel issue. I’m really annoyed at him, he’s not changing his view at all.” A spokesperson for the grassroots leftwing group Momentum said: “It is equally clear that Labour’s whip & selection processes are neither independent nor fair. The Labour Leadership is sacrificing anti-racism for political gain - and achieving neither.”"

        "content": "January had barely begun when Humza Yousaf made a vigorous pitch to neutralise Scottish Labour’s increasingly successful appeals to Scottish National party supporters.\nKeir Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland to win the general election”, the SNP leader said, in a direct counter to the Labour leader’s message that winning more seats in Scotland was fundamental to a Labour victory.\nInstead, Yousaf told SNP politicians and activists assembled at a bohemian arts venue in Glasgow, Scotland needed nationalist MPs to “keep [Starmer] honest” – and he set an ambitious target of winning all six Scottish Conservative seats at the forthcoming general election.\nThe mood was relaxed and convivial; a contrast to the presidential-style launches of his predecessor as first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who blindsided the party when she announced her resignation a year ago this week. \nThe stakes for Yousaf are very high. Ten years on from the independence referendum, Labour – which currently has only two Scottish MPs – is poised for a dramatic comeback. Most recent opinion polls show the SNP is facing heavy losses in the general election, potentially losing 24 of its 43 seats.\n Interactive\n\n“If the SNP gets around 30 seats then he may be able to hold on, but if it’s between 20-25 then it’s a different conversation,” says one former Holyrood minister. “Questions will have to be asked,” one SNP MP added.\nIf the losses are substantial, many assume he will face a leadership challenge in the shape of Kate Forbes, who has maintained a high profile after narrowly losing to Yousaf in the bruising contest to succeed Sturgeon a year ago.\nThe upbeat mood of early January has faded. “Activists are feeling flat,” said one usually positive SNP MP. “They’re not in the place they want to be ahead of a general election and they hate the ‘Tory-free Scotland’ strategy, which is a hard sell in constituencies that aren’t up against the Conservatives”.\nParty membership figures show a continuing decline, down from the post-referendum heights of 120,000 to just over 69,000.\nThere has been sympathy for Yousaf, who has faced an onslaught of political misfortunes since he took over: the arrest of Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murrell, in Operation Branchform, Police Scotland’s investigation into the SNP’s finances; infighting over the governing partnership with the Scottish Greens; a chastening court loss to the UK government over Holyrood’s gender recognition policy; and this week the resignation of the health secretary, Michael Matheson, over his astronomical parliamentary iPad bill.\nBut it is wearing thin. Many MP colleagues are now “just pissed off”, one said. “They’ve had enough. There’s mixed messaging from the leadership and that’s coming from the top down.”\nWhile activists and elected members believe the party benefits from Yousaf’s more inclusive style, they repeatedly identify a sense of drift – the defining big idea he promised when elected last April has not yet materialised.\nYousaf’s advisers accept that project was derailed by last year’s crises – not least his in-laws finding themselves trapped in Gaza by Israeli bombardment. But this year’s election gives him the platform he needs to lay out his vision, they say; this is the time when voters pay most attention.\nYousaf will focus on child poverty, fairness and social justice in the coming months, attacking Starmer’s caution and fiscal conservatism, for example on the two-child benefit cap and green measures.\nThey believe Yousaf’s stance on Gaza – immediately calling for a ceasefire and speaking movingly about his relatives’ plight – has already helped to shift voter perceptions. “There’s an ongoing task to define him but with Gaza, whether people liked it or didn’t, you began to see a clear definition of the first minister, who he is.”\nMost notably there was outrage from council and opposition leaders over Yousaf’s surprise decision to freeze council tax rates after the SNP’s crushing defeat by Labour in October’s Rutherglen byelection, yet the policy has proven to be extremely popular with voters.\n“The disconnection between the Scottish political bubble and Scottish electoral reality I don’t think has ever been greater,” said one government source.\nHe points to a new Ipsos poll giving the SNP a clear lead over Labour – seven points at Westminster and nine points in Holyrood constituencies. Although it tracked a steady decline in the SNP’s lead over Labour, the poll was conducted after the UK Covid inquiry revealed wholesale WhatsApp deletion, unrecorded meetings and accusations of politicising the pandemic by Scottish ministers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOther polls have found Labour neck and neck with the SNP in Westminster preferences, however, while the Scottish Election Study has highlighted a sharp drop in perceived competence for the SNP, once rock solid under Sturgeon.\nThey all underline a sea change in Scottish voting preferences that greatly benefits Labour: for the first time since the 2014 referendum, people’s constitutional beliefs are no longer tied to their voting intention.\nScottish Labour believes its polling numbers will hold up, as it encounters increasing disquiet about “SNP secrecy” on the doorstep. Voters “are talking about camper vans, WhatsApps and Michael Matheson’s iPad because they’re relatable,” said one senior Scottish Labour strategist.\nAnd a massive unknown is the police investigation – and the potential nightmare scenario of fighting a general election with some of the party’s senior figures facing trial for embezzlement charges.\nAs for Sturgeon, the raw emotion she displayed during her evidence at the Covid inquiry shocked many who had been following her chirpy social media output showcasing hill-walking and book festivals.\nHer tears were, friends say, “utterly sincere”, and evidence of the punishing intensity of leading the country through the pandemic. She knew the session would be gruelling and had prepared assiduously, with strong support from her parents and close friends, most of whom are not in politics.\nShe is forging ahead with her memoir, due to be published in 2025, which she is viewing as her opportunity to “tell her side”. One friend observes that Sturgeon continues to sell out SNP events, most recently a comedy fundraiser and Burns dinner: “The party hasn’t walked away, which gives her strength when the bad shit happens.”"

        "content": "Labour is facing criticism for standing by a parliamentary candidate who has been forced to apologise for suggesting that Israel allowed Hamas’s 7 October attacks to take place to provide grounds to invade Gaza. The comments made by Azhar Ali, the party’s candidate in the Rochdale byelection, have threatened to reignite the damaging row over antisemitism in the Labour party that blighted Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. “This man does not belong in a major political party, let alone in parliament, yet Labour is, incredibly, still backing his candidacy after a quick apology,” said Joe Glasman, the head of political and government investigations at Campaign Against Antisemitism. “This is distressingly familiar to days that Sir Keir Starmer promised were behind us. This is not tearing antisemitism out ‘by its roots’.” Ali apologised for the “deeply offensive” remarks after he was recorded telling a meeting of the Lancashire Labour party that Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat. The recording, obtained by the Mail on Sunday, had Ali saying: “The Egyptians are saying that they warned Israel 10 days earlier … Americans warned them a day before [that] … there’s something happening. They deliberately took the security off, they allowed … that massacre that gives them the green light to do whatever they bloody want.” Ali, a Lancashire county councillor and former government adviser who was made an OBE in 2020 for public service, has since apologised “unreservedly to the Jewish community” for the comments, which he acknowledged were “deeply offensive, ignorant and false”. He said: “Hamas’s horrific terror attack was the responsibility of Hamas alone, and they are still holding hostages who must be released.” He promised to “urgently apologise to Jewish leaders for my inexcusable comments”, saying that “the Labour party has changed unrecognisably under Keir Starmer’s leadership”. The party has stood by him, with its national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, saying that Ali’s comments were “completely wrong” and did not represent the party’s view. But he told Sky News: “He’s issued a complete apology and retraction. And I hope he learns a good lesson from it because he should never have said something like that in the first place.” The party’s shadow minister without portfolio, Nick Thomas-Symonds, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Ali had fallen for a conspiracy theory, and that his apology should be taken at face value. “Councillor Ali has apologised unreservedly, he’s retracted those remarks, and he’s also shown a sense of the gravity of the offence that has been caused, and the need now to do tremendous amounts of work to rebuild trust with the Jewish community, which is going to be absolutely essential.

But he stopped short of calling on Labour to drop the candidate, warning that the “alternative in Rochdale is George Galloway”, whose victory would “harm the Jewish community far more than electing Ali”. He added: “We know how far the party has come under Keir Starmer in tackling antisemitism and that the party, from Starmer down, is as shocked and disgusted by Ali’s comments as we are.” The deadline to remove Ali from the ballot paper has passed, but the party could withdraw campaign support. The Conservatives have called for the aspiring MP’s campaign to be suspended and his Labour party membership removed. The cabinet minister Michael Gove said: “Sir Keir Starmer cannot continue to support this candidacy.”"

        "content": "You excoriate the Labour leadership for “a humiliating rowback” on the green transition (Editorial, 8 February). But hold on! When the £28bn ambition was declared in the autumn of 2021, interest rates on government debt were about 1% but are now 4.5%, with repayments of debt coincidentally increasing by around the same proportion of GDP. Last December, the repayments hit £119bn. In realistic household terms, since 2021 your mortgage payments have soared, and your family income has stagnated, so don’t plan to buy a big electric car for some years. What the statement by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves makes clear (Opinion, 8 February) is that they are not going to promise to spend £28bn using power that they don’t yet have and might not get access to because of the dire state of the economy and public finances that they will inherit. That’s not “hawkish”, it’s plain honesty. And it’s better than emulating the ostrich or repeating a boosterish Johnsonian pyramid of piffle. You say many traditional Labour voters will “be left asking what the party is for”. It’s for Great British Energy (£7bn), the National Wealth Fund (£8bn), green steel (£3bn), and a housing and planning programme that can change the scale and strategy of public investment in generating growth, skills and jobs, and combating the climate crisis. That, as you say, “cannot wait” – but it cannot be fought by glowing, though notional, promises from a party still in powerless opposition. Better to have the truth about what will be done to secure the reality – not just the “hope” – of a “better life”. After years of corroded integrity and economic and social impoverishment, surely that can “inspire a generation”.Neil KinnockLabour, House of Lords • You note of Labour’s retreat from its green investment strategy that some will argue that “economic credibility is the rock on which everything redistributive rests”. That was the view of Labour first chancellor, Philip Snowden, exactly 100 years ago too. Unfortunately, it led in quite short order not to a mildly more equal society but to the 1931 national government.Keith FlettTottenham, London • Investing in a green future can’t be a mere ambition, it has to be a necessity. We have to do everything possible to reduce carbon emissions, but do so in a way that creates a more equal society. This is the essence of a just transition. By training a green army of workers to insulate every house in the country that needs it, we lower emissions, reduce the worrying burden of heating bills and provide good, well-paid jobs to people across the country who need them. Labour simply cannot be allowed to backslide on the commitment to such a just transition. Not just because it’s the right thing to do; it’s also the popular thing to do – 82% of potential Labour voters believe investing in renewable energy should be a priority. The pressure to cave in to the demands of rightwing politicians and the media is a direct consequence of our first-past-the-post voting system. Proportional representation creates a level playing field for ideas such as a just transition to flourish. To decarbonise, we must democratise. Labour has to put climate and equality first – and that means putting democracy first.Neal Lawson Director, Compass, Clare Short Former secretary of state for international development, Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords, Carla Denyer Leader, Green party, Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion, Tim Farron MP Former leader, Liberal Democrats • As a longstanding member of the Labour party, I am appalled by the apparent decision to abandon abolition of the House of Lords (Remaining Labour policies face ‘bombproof’ test to finalise manifesto, 9 February). The case for ridding us of this ludicrously bloated, undemocratic, archaic and expensive institution is surely overwhelming. Is it too cynical to suspect that part of the reasoning lies in the hope among those responsible that they too might one day enjoy the luxury of being members? That they could follow in the footsteps of the likes of Mandelson, Darling and Blunkett, to mention just a few?Dr David MervinEmeritus reader in politics, University of Warwick • With Keir Starmer’s ditching of the £28bn green pledge, I am left wondering, as I look back from my seat in the Emirates Stadium towards his, whether a belief in Arsenal is the only thing left that we have in common.Ian WilsonThames Ditton, Surrey • Oh dear – Green party here I come!Dr Tim Paine Bristol  • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "At the start of a week when the Conservatives face the prospect of two byelection defeats – possible tasters of the general election wipeout to come – voices on the party’s right calling for Boris Johnson to return in some form are growing louder. On Sunday they came not just through renewed pressure from the Tory-leaning press but from the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, who said that Rishi Sunak “should swallow some pride” and bring his rival back into the fold. For many who recall Johnson’s fall from grace after an investigation found he had misled parliament – and the bitter 1,000-word statement accompanying his resignation as an MP last year in which he attacked Sunak’s government – such a course of action is unthinkable. Yet the prospect of a return has lingered since Johnson himself planted the seed during his 2022 departure speech from Downing Street when he likened himself to Cincinnatus, the Roman political leader cum farmer who “returned to his plough” but staged a comeback to Rome to lead as a dictator. The former prime minister also continues to enjoy a hardcore following who yearn for the man who delivered the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher’s 1987 victory. David Campbell Bannerman, chair of the Conservative Democratic Organisation founded by the ex-PM’s allies to rally grassroots support, told the Guardian that bringing back Johnson would send a strong signal to Brexiter Conservatives swinging to Richard Tice’s Reform party. “But why should he help Sunak when Sunak allegedly threatened to bring him down again if he stood as leader last time – and Boris would have won the leadership. Sunak would have to go down on both knees and beg Boris to help save him,” Campbell Bannerman said. For the Mail on Sunday, which carried an editorial calling for the political return of the man who is now employed by its sister paper, he is the “star striker” sitting on the bench. Days after Andrew Griffith, the science minister, said Johnson was a “great voice” who would be welcomed back to the Tory election campaign, the Mail and Sunday Telegraph reported that it would take a personal phone call from Sunak to secure his return. But what difference would Johnson make beyond the Tory grassroots yearning for the “Boris brand”? One thing he would be unable to change is the stark economic reality, which the Treasury concedes will be underlined this week when data shows inflation rising again, a fresh blow to a key Sunak pledge. Nevertheless, Johnson loyalists insist he is a proven vote winner with the ability somehow to appeal to voters in so-called red wall seats taken from Labour in 2019. Johnson was an “electoral force” who should be weaponised, suggested Kwarteng, who urged Sunak to turn to the man with whom he badly fell out. “And if that means swallowing some pride and you’re suppressing a bit of ego by reaching out to someone who’s an approved campaigner then, yeah, then he should do that,” Kwarteng told GB News. Of course, such a scenario assumes that the ruthless ambition always associated with Johnson has somehow dissipated and that he would be content with anything other than wearing the emperor’s wreath. It’s a stretch but still not an insurmountable obstacle to imagine a Tory MP falling on their own sword to pave the way back to parliament for Johnson. Even then, and were he to pull off a truly Roman palace coup, polling last month by Ipsos UK gave him a favorability rating among 2019 Tory voters of 43%, while at 34% his unfavorability rating was higher than that of Sunak. For now, at least, enthusiasm among Tory MPs for a Johnson rerun appears limited to a handful of outliers and retiring parliamentarians. No 10 sources say that “Boris and everyone else” will be welcome as part of the “whole Conservative family” coming together to take on Labour. Expect Sunak to repeat variations on that theme through gritted teeth."

        "content": "In 2014, a BBC Panorama documentary revealed widespread, well-organised cheating in the English language tests that international students were required to take in the UK if they wanted to change their course or renew their visa. As a result of these allegations the Home Office revoked the visas of about 35,000 students. Most were thrown off their courses; 2,500 students were deported and 7,200 left the country after being warned that they faced arrest and detention if they stayed. Thousands of students have spent years protesting their innocence. Were students cheating? There was clear evidence that many students had paid money to people working at some test centres to ensure they passed the test; at least 21 people have received prison sentences for helping candidates cheat at the test centres. But over the past decade it has emerged that thousands were wrongly accused. The Home Office has itself been accused of rushing to penalise a whole cohort of international students. What went wrong? The Home Office website gave students details of four approved test providers where they could sit a test to prove they had a high enough level of English to be able to study in the UK. Panorama exposed cheating in two centres run by a UK subsidiary of the US-based company Educational Testing Service (ETS). The Home Office asked ETS to investigate. After reviewing recordings of the spoken part of the test, ETS found that of about 58,000 people who sat the Test of English for International Communication (Toeic) between 2011 and 2014, 58% had used deception, and their visas were cancelled. Another 39% of tests were questionable, and those students were later asked to resit the test. ETS said only 2,200 students who took its tests during that period had definitely not cheated. Could 97% of students who sat a test run by a Home Office-approved company all have been cheating? Campaigners acknowledge there was deception but say it is implausible that such a high proportion of students could have been involved. Some of those who have tried to clear their names were educated in English-medium schools and said they had no reason to pay someone to ensure they passed a relatively basic language test. How were students affected? Thousands of students were unable to complete their courses, wasting thousands of pounds of fees. Many say relations with their parents were catastrophically damaged because family members struggled to believe that the highly respected British judicial system could have made such an error. Others say an outstanding accusation of deception from the UK government has made it difficult to get visas to study elsewhere. Despite the seriousness of the allegation, students were initially given no right of appeal in the UK; it proved almost impossible for wrongly deported students to challenge the Home Office’s decision from abroad. Why is this still a problem? A decade after the Panorama broadcast, immigration tribunals are still dealing with attempts by former students to get the allegation reversed. About 3,600 accused students have won immigration appeals, although there are no records of whether these judgments indicate that they were found innocent of cheating or whether they won for other reasons. What evidence is there of cheating? Lawyers acting for students have argued that the evidence of cheating provided by ETS is unreliable. Initially, ETS provided no evidence, but after a few years the company released recordings for use in immigration tribunals of students speaking during the oral section of the exams. These voices rarely matched up with the voice of the accused student, lawyers say. The Home Office argues that this is evidence that someone else took the test fraudulently on the student’s behalf. The students’ lawyers argue that the mismatch may indicate that the ETS records are unreliable, or that dishonest people running the test centres may have submitted different recordings for everyone taking the tests, to ensure that students who had paid to pass were successful. Bona fide test-takers would not have seen anything suspicious in the test centres. What do wrongly accused students want? The charity Migrant Voice has been working with students since 2017 and says they are hoping for an acknowledgement that they have been wrongly accused, the chance to return to their studies in the UK and to have the allegation of deception lifted from their immigration records. What does the Home Office say? “Abuse of our immigration system will not be tolerated and those who do will face the appropriate measures against them. This includes cheating on English language tests.” ETS says it closed its UK subsidiary in response to the allegation and no longer operates English-language tests in the UK. It says its people and practices have changed."

        "content": "“George Galloway all the way!” cried Ali Dar, the assistant manager of Rochdale Chunky Chicken. “He came here a few days ago, he went in all the shops, and every person, even on social media, is voting for him. I voted last time Labour, but this time: definitely George Galloway.” Until now, he said, “the Asian community was supporting Labour unconditionally”. But not in the byelection on 29 February, because of Keir Starmer’s refusal to back an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. A Labour canvasser wearing a red rosette waited silently for his chicken. The Guardian asked: “Are you not going to try to persuade him?” “Above my pay grade,” the canvasser answered. Quietly, he said he did not think Galloway would win. He’d been out all morning knocking on doors elsewhere in the constituency, where the demographics were different, and “Galloway didn’t come up at all”. Chunky Chicken is in the ward of Milkstone and Deeplish, just outside Rochdale town centre, where 72% of people are Muslim, according to the 2021 census. Galloway, the former Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin (1987-97) and Respect party MP for Bethnal Green and Bow (2005-10) and Bradford West (2012-15), has been working the ward hard – when not hosting his YouTube talkshow or retweeting admiring posts about Vladimir Putin. He walks the streets in his black fedora and Palestinian scarf, megaphone in hand, urging people to “lend” him their vote as “the ultimate protest” against Labour. They have “an opportunity sent by the almighty to be a voice of Gaza in the world”, he says. Much of his campaigning happens online, with a team of enthusiastic young people spreading the message on social media. “It seems to be working,” said one well-connected Deeplish resident. “Every morning I open WhatsApp and more people have changed their profile pictures to ‘Vote Galloway.’” Galloway, who is now standing as the Workers party candidate, has also attracted a few unwelcome fans, including Nick Griffin, the former leader of the far-right British National party, who tweeted: “The man’s not perfect, but he’s streets ahead of any other possible winner.” Standing on a pile of wooden pallets outside the Bilal mosque on Friday, Galloway laid his message on thick: “How are you going to answer your children, your grandchildren, on judgment day when you are asked: ‘What did you do when Keir Starmer asked you to endorse what he has done?’” He received only muted applause from the 50-strong crowd, who had to be coaxed towards the front so that it didn’t look like Galloway was talking to an empty cul-de-sac on TikTok. Labour is focusing resources elsewhere, after its candidate, the Lancashire county councillor Azhar Ali, was repeatedly abused by Deeplish locals. A video doing the rounds online shows him in a takeaway being called “Keir Starmer’s bum chum” while diners shout “free Palestine”. Ali, who worked as a Home Office adviser for five years after the 7/7 bombings, has supported an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as well as the release of hostages on both sides. But it doesn’t seem to make much difference to many Muslim voters. He acknowledged “there is anger on the streets” and “some support has drained away”. But he insisted that “bread-and-butter issues” such as the NHS “trump the Gaza issue”. On Sunday, Ali was forced to apologise after the Mail on Sunday reported remarks he made in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks in Israel, in which he said the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, deliberately allowed 1,400 of its citizens to be massacred in order to give it the “green light” for military action. Pat McFadden, Labour’s election coordinator, said Ali was “wrong to say that, he should never have said it”. Asked by Sky News if Ali remained a Labour candidate, he said: “In the upcoming byelection? Yes he will.” However, McFadden’s remarks prompted some speculation that Ali could be suspended by Labour if he is elected, and replaced in the general election later this year. Galloway, said Ali, is “targeting just the Muslim community. He’s come in on his white horse trying to be the saviour, but all he’s doing is dividing the community.” He said he was “big and ugly enough” to engage with angry voters. “But what I’m not going to put up with is people being rude, disparaging and threatening abuse towards young women and men who go out campaigning for me.” Across the whole constituency, Muslims make up 30% of the population. In contrast, Galloway’s last byelection win took place in Bradford West in 2012, where Muslims made up 51% of the constituency. His last byelection loss was in 2021 in Batley and Spen, where 23% of the population were Muslim. To win in Rochdale, Galloway will have to overturn the 9,668 majority won in 2019 by Labour’s Tony Lloyd, who died from leukaemia last month. Strolling down Milkstone Road this week, Paul Hanson, a retired police officer, questioned whether Rochdale’s “indigenous” people would vote for a Pakistani Muslim, particularly after the town’s grooming scandal, where mostly Pakistani men exploited vulnerable white girls. “I have no problem with them – fantastic people, some of them, the ones that you get to know. But they have their beliefs and cultures and we have ours,” he said. In Littleborough, a wealthy and largely white village on the other side of the constituency, no one seemed to know Galloway was standing. Ann Robbins, out doing her shopping, said she would stick with Labour. She said she was a fan of Starmer, describing him as “a trustworthy man. I think he will try to do what he says.” In George Kelsall Booksellers, Ben Kelsall said he, too, would vote Labour, describing Starmer as “more serious than the government at the minute”. Simon Danczuk, Rochdale’s Labour MP from 2010 to 2017 who was suspended from the party after a series of scandals, is standing for Reform UK, the rightwing party co-founded by Nigel Farage. He said Ali had spoken repeatedly about the “plight of the Palestinians” but “had not once bothered to speak upon behalf of the Asian grooming gang victims”. This, said Danczuk, illustrated Labour’s “woke” agenda. “Why would a Labour politician be more interested in the plight of the Palestinians than he is of poor white working class?” he said. Ali said Danczuk was “living in cloud cuckoo land”. He said he chaired East Lancashire’s group against sexual exploitation and had “a strong record of calling out grooming, whichever community it’s in”. In his speech outside Bilal mosque, Galloway said he would perform a citizen’s arrest on any groomer. He then listed various northern paedophiles who were not Muslim, including Rochdale’s former Liberal MP, Cyril Smith. “Jimmy Savile wasn’t a Muslim,” he added."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak should “swallow some pride” and bring back the “electoral force” that is Boris Johnson, the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said. Kwarteng, who announced earlier this week that he would be standing down as an MP at the general election, also said the prime minister needed to “work on his outreach” with backbench Tory MPs also thinking about quitting. The MP’s candid criticism of his party leader on Sunday came amid fresh indications of a renewed clamour among supporters of Johnson for him to return in some form, with calls in the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Telegraph as the Tories face a potential electoral wipeout. The former prime minister and Conservative leader expects his successor to telephone him personally if he wants to ask for his help campaigning in the general election, the Sunday Telegraph also reported. On Sunday, Kwarteng said in an interview with GB News: “I’ve always been a big Boris fan. He had a very good success as an electoral force. You know, we’re 20 points behind, and the polls haven’t really moved in the last year. So it’s not time to simply say ‘more of the same’. Something has to change, for us to have a chance of winning. “And if that means swallowing some pride and you’re suppressing a bit of ego by reaching out to someone who’s an approved campaigner then, yeah, then he should do that.” A No 10 source said: “We want the whole Conservative family to come together to beat Starmer and Labour at the next election. Boris and everyone else united in that aim will of course be welcome.” Kwarteng, who oversaw the ill-fated “mini-budget” under the shortlived government of Liz Truss, said the prime minister had not called him to ask him to change his mind after announcing that he would not stand again as an MP. But while he said that he would not have expected that from a busy prime minister, he added that Sunak “needed to work on his outreach with backbenchers” if he was to have a chance of winning round others planning to quit. Kwarteng, who represents Spelthorne, in Surrey, said his decision to stand down had been a personal one because it was time “to move on” but conceded that his party’s poor standing in the polls was also a factor. “I think the fact that we’re facing a difficult election has something to do with it. You’ve got to be honest about that,” added the former chancellor, who joins dozens of other Tory MPs who have announced that they will not be contesting the election. More than 80 sitting MPs have announced they will leave parliament at the next election, more than the 74 who retired in 2019. As chancellor, Kwarteng was accused of delivering a reckless mini-budget for the rich after his £45bn tax-cutting package sent the pound crashing to its lowest level against the dollar in 37 years. He has since declared thousands of pounds from media appearances and was due to start advising an Australian iron ore mining company on its clean energy ambitions from last year October – a year after his disastrous mini-budget crashed the pound."

        "content": "Until last week’s U-turn on its pledge to spend £28bn on greening the economy, Labour had a coherent story to tell on the economy. It was not an especially exciting story but it made sense. The narrative went like this. Since coming to power in 2010, the Tories have made a right mess of things. Misguided austerity has resulted in weak growth and flatlining living standards. Public services have been starved of money and too little has been done to safeguard the future of the planet. Failure on such a comprehensive scale requires a different approach. After last week’s emasculation of its green prosperity plan, the storyline has changed. It now reads: the Tories have left Britain in a parlous state but if you vote for us little will change. We are continuity Conservatism. Previously, Labour was going into the election offering a mild form of green Keynesianism as the alternative to stagnation. It will now be appealing to voters on the basis that it can run the status quo more competently than the current lot. To be fair, that wouldn’t be all that difficult. After the psychodramas of a parliament that has given us three prime ministers in Downing Street and five chancellors at the Treasury, some stability would not go amiss. What’s more, Labour always needs to persuade a sceptical electorate that it can run the economy competently. Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are understandably reluctant to have the next election campaign dominated not by the government’s dismal economic record but by Labour’s £28b “tax bombshell”, which is what Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt would prefer. The scars of the 1992 defeat are still livid. All that said, the ditching of the £28bn pledge reveals an ideological vacuum at the heart of Labour’s economic policy and an acute lack of self-confidence. It is also storing up big problems for Starmer and Reeves once the election is won. The case for green Keynesianism was made just last month by a group of economists from the London School of Economics and Cambridge University, including Lord Stern, the author of the 2006 report on the economics of climate change. Last month’s report made the following points: the planned cuts in public investment over the next few years will lead to a continuation of stagnant productivity and weak growth; the UK requires an increase in public investment of 1% of national output (£26bn) to make up for decades of under-investment in the capital needed to tackle climate change and make the economy more efficient and productive; more public investment would crowd in private investment; and the investment by the state would pay for itself. On the last point, the authors of the report could not be clearer: “There will be upfront investment costs to delivering the transition to sustainable, inclusive and resilient growth, but targeted and temporary borrowing for good public net investment reduces the debt-to-GDP ratio over time and is fiscally responsible. “Once the UK’s sustainable innovation system is up and running, government support can be phased down, as new, more efficient and productive industries increasingly outcompete the old and generate their own global revenues and inward investment. By contrast, inaction would probably prove costly to economic competitiveness and financial resilience and require costly remedial support later on.” The Starmer-Reeves case for watering down the green prosperity plan is that economic and financial conditions have changed since it was originally announced at the 2021 party conference. This argument doesn’t really stand up to much scrutiny. Growth is actually much weaker than it was in 2021, when activity was recovering from the disruption caused by Covid lockdowns. Inflation certainly surged in 2022 as a result of supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine but is now on a declining trend. There may well be a small rise in the annual inflation rate announced this week, but it will be below 2% by the spring. Likewise, interest rates are heading downwards. The financial markets expect them to fall from 5.25% to just over 3% by 2026. The other reason for not diluting the green prosperity plan is that the news on the climate crisis has been getting worse, with 2023 the hottest year on record. The case for increasing public investment to green the economy is as compelling as in 2021, if not more so. In the meantime, Liz Truss managed to wreck the Conservative party’s reputation for economic competence in the way that Black Wednesday did 30 years earlier. That made a Labour victory much more likely but has also made the party even more determined to articulate a strategy that doesn’t risk spooking the markets. The paper by Stern and his colleagues demonstrates why borrowing to invest is consistent with financial prudence, but even were that not the case Labour could still fund its full green prosperity plan by raising tax. As the tax expert Richard Murphy pointed out last week, two simple changes aimed at the better off would raise almost £28bn: charging the same rate on capital gains as is paid on income tax would net £12bn while restricting tax relief on pension contributions so everyone gets relief at the same tax rate, whatever their income, would raise a further £14.5bn, and make the system fairer to boot. Labour has decided against borrowing £28bn and it has also decided that it won’t tax the wealthy to raise the £28bn either. Instead, the belief is that stability will produce higher levels of growth and free up resources to meet the public’s demands for better public services. What’s the difference between that and what Sunak and Hunt are saying? Not a lot as far as I can see."

        "content": "It was in late September 2022, as Labour gathered for its annual conference in Liverpool, that the party’s top brass began to believe. The financial markets were in turmoil after Kwasi Kwarteng’s kamikaze mini-budget the week before. Interest and mortgage rates were spiralling as the Liz Truss experiment imploded. The pound had crashed.\nMembers of Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet team tried to look and sound stern as the conference opened, reflecting the public’s fears of financial meltdown and worries about its effect on the cost of living, but secretly they could not believe their political good fortune.\nSome of the more forward-looking among them thought that thanks to Truss and Kwarteng, one of the keys to a general election victory was now within the party’s grasp – and it was marked “fiscal responsibility”.\nWhen shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves addressed delegates in Liverpool on the Monday, she fleshed out her party’s green prosperity plan, which had been launched 12 months earlier as the centrepiece of the party’s entire economic agenda. Labour, she said, would invest in solar, wind and tidal energy to “free ourselves from dependence on Russia” and build a modern sustainable economy.\nShe repeated two sentences, word for word, from her conference speech the year before. “I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain’s first green chancellor.”\nBut one thing – one important detail – was missing.\nThere was no mention in the 2022 speech of the figure she had announced 12 months earlier. The £28bn a year of green investment (which she had promised would be delivered throughout the first term of a Labour government) had suddenly gone missing, as the prospect of power loomed into view.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, almost 18 months on, some in the Labour party believe that even then, in the autumn of 2022, Reeves was having doubts about committing so much money to the policy. “I think even then that the fiscal hawks in the party were getting to her,” said one key source. “I think they were beginning to think this could put fiscal credibility at risk.”\nEarly last Thursday evening, after an excruciating and tortuously protracted policy row at the top of the party, which at times caused real tensions between Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Labour MPs were invited to an online briefing with Reeves and Ed Miliband.\nThe £28bn figure had at last just been officially declared dead and the entire plan had been sliced in half. They wanted to explain it to the footsoldiers who had been selling the plan as Labour’s big idea for the past two and a half years.\nMost Labour MPs were on their way home and could not tune in. But about 40 did so, and there were lively exchanges.\nNo one bought in fully to the Reeves/Miliband show of total unity, and some were furious. Everyone knew Miliband, the shadow energy and net zero secretary, had fought to keep the £28bn intact and that Reeves had wanted to water it down for months, if not much longer.\nThey knew too that Starmer had been uneasy about dropping it until days before the policy was dumped, fearing that if he did, people would think he did not believe in anything.\nThe whole episode was demoralising and dispiriting, said one senior figure on the backbenches on Thursday evening. “If we can’t invest for the long term in climate change without worrying about what the Tories are going to say, then when will be able to invest in anything for the long term?”\nOther MPs who were present at the briefing said colleagues with strong Liberal Democrat forces in their constituencies, such as Catherine West in Hornsey and Wood Green, were particularly hot under the collar, saying they had pushed the £28bn on doorsteps for more than two years only for the mat to be pulled from under them.\nPlenty of Labour MPs and activists are very uneasy. If this pledge, which had formed the cornerstone of Labour’s economic and green policy, could be thrown overboard, what, they ask, will ever be sacred? And, with the party now in the final stages of drawing up a manifesto for the next general election, what, when it comes to polling day, will be left?\nInevitably, after the deed was finally done, Team Starmer was quick to cast the “mother of all U-turns”, as it was rapidly (and justifiably) labelled, as merely good, pragmatic leadership.\n\n\nLabour wins when its agenda is radical but deliverable in the world as it is. Thank God that is the Labour party under Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves\n Josh Simons, Labour Together\n\n\n\nJosh Simons, director of the Labour Together group, which broadly supports the Starmer agenda, said the move had become inevitable because of the change in circumstances since Reeves announced it in 2021. The party should be unapologetic, he said. “The £28bn made sense then. Three years, three prime ministers, and one self-inflicted financial crisis later, it makes no sense at all. So often, the Labour party has lost elections because it clung to unachievable, pious, ideological purity. Labour wins when its agenda is radical but deliverable in the world as it is. Thank God that is the Labour party under Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.\n“It’s a harder path but a braver one, which appreciates the gravity of earning the British people’s trust. And it is how you change things. The £28bn number is dead. Good riddance. Now we can talk about Labour’s ambitious plan for Britain.”\nTo people on the left of the party, and plenty on its centre ground, that kind of thinking is precisely the problem, and typical of a right-of-centre Labour faction which claims that it alone understands and prioritises the pursuit of power. As one Labour official put it: “Those of us who believed in £28bn also believe in getting into office. They are wrong to think they have a monopoly on that.”\nMiliband told the Observer that Labour would “go into the next election with a world-leading climate agenda”. He added: “I am proud of our agenda and I relish the fight between Labour’s ambition and a Conservative party flirting with climate denial.”\n\n Related: Labour cuts £28bn green investment pledge by half \n\nOthers are less convinced. Neal Lawson, director of the soft left Compass thinktank, who is threatened with expulsion from the party for sharing a Liberal Democrat MP’s call on Twitter in 2021 for some voters to back Green candidates in local elections, said in an essay published last week that the U-turn was symptomatic of a wider process of stifling debate and innovative thinking. “They ‘burn the village to save it,’” he wrote. “And so, an iron cage is built for any ‘victory’, not a springboard for greater radicalism.”\nBarry Gardiner, the former shadow energy secretary, said: “Politically, it’s strategically incompetent,” while senior environmentalists were clearly dismayed. Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, suggested the UK under a Labour government could lose out in the race for green investment if it was seen to go cool on the environmental agenda: “If we want warm homes, reasonable bills, and energy independence, investment is required … There is a global economic race to build clean industries and Britain has to compete for green investment.”\nAs rumours of the U-turn swirled early last week Paul Johnson, director of the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there were no other big-ticket spending items on Labour’s list for the electorate to get excited about. “What is most remarkable about this pledge is not its scale, nor its affordability; it’s the fact that it is the only substantial spending pledge that Labour has made. It is quite the statement of priority. It has pledged next to nothing over and above the present government’s plans for anything else – health, welfare, social care, local government, education, anything.”\nAs well as raising important issues about the substance of Labour policy, the £28bn fiasco also raises questions about the party’s processes and the chain of command under Starmer.\nA remaining puzzle is why Starmer continued to use the £28bn figure in interviews just days before the U-turn. Was he in a pitched battle with Reeves in which, finally, he gave in? His supporters insist not, and say that he merely stuck to the official line until the figure was dropped, rather than opting for an interim “fudge” position. (This generous interpretation ignores the fact that Reeves had clearly avoided saying the figure for some time.)\nBut the level of indecision and confusion that had been allowed to endure for weeks and months, was, many MPs noted, off the scale. People who had worked with both Tony Blair and Starmer noted that while Blair had welcomed competing views, his own opinion on an issue was always easy to discern.\nStarmer’s approach, by contrast, was more gnomic – he would hear differing opinions before retreating to make a decision, with those involved left unclear about where he might land. That, they said, explained in part the confusion that had endured for weeks.\nIt was also due, insiders said, to Starmer’s insistence that if the figure were to be axed, Labour had to come up with a robust alternative that could not be moved again. That led to a lot of often painful meetings with various figures across the party and industry, inevitably leading to leaks.\nOnce the move was made, there was delight at the top of the party at the BBC News alert that followed. It said Starmer had dropped the plan because the Tories had “crashed the economy”.\n\n Related: Starmer’s £28bn green plan was bungled but Labour still has bold hopes for the country – and the planet | Polly Toynbee \n\nInternal supporters of the change are now bullish about what the U-turn allows them to do – attack the Tory economic record without being hampered by a borrowing figure they were struggling to justify.\n“We’ve got a platform now which we can agree on, and we can campaign on,” said one. “We’ve been able to remind people of a core part of our argument – that the Conservatives crashed the economy. Previously, we wanted to attack Jeremy Hunt after reports that he wanted to “max out” the government’s fiscal headroom with tax cuts. We weren’t able to do that because the [£28bn] figure became a distraction. Now we can.”\nBut while that may be true, the whole fiasco has reinforced doubts among MPs and activists on the left and in the centre who were never convinced about Starmer and his beliefs in the first place: “He dropped most of the 10 pledges he made during his leadership campaign. Now he undermines his five missions by dropping this. People will have a right, the Tories will have a right in the run-up to an election, to ask: what is this guy about? What does he really believe in?”\n• This article was amended on 11 February 2024. An earlier version said that the Labour Together group “grew out of Starmer’s leadership campaign [in 2020]”; it was officially launched in 2016."

        "content": "Conservative MPs on Saturday night predicted fresh attacks on Rishi Sunak’s leadership within days, as they accused their own party of surrendering to Labour without a proper fight in two formerly safe Tory seats where byelections will be held this week. MPs from across the party complained that losses in Wellingborough and Kingswood on Thursday had already been “priced in”, as one senior figure said defeatism had set in, with the party having descended into a “death spiral”. Ministers and MPs said they had not faced any of the normal demands to go to the two seats this weekend to drum up last-minute votes as is customary before byelections. One Sunak ally said the contests had been deliberately timed in the parliamentary recess to reduce the chances of anti-Sunak “chatter and plotting” at Westminster if the Tories lost. But senior MPs said not properly contesting the seats risked demoralising an already deflated party during the run-in to a general election, and at a time when Labour was vulnerable after performing a massive U-turn last week over its green economic plans. “The party hasn’t really tried,” said a former cabinet minister. “They’re expecting defeats. [It’s] rather demoralising.” Another influential figure said of the byelections: “They are very much priced into the death spiral.” In Wellingborough, the Tories are defending a majority of more than 18,000 while in Kingswood, its majority was in excess of 11,000 at the 2019 election.   Related: Rishi Sunak ‘up for the fight’ as Tories continue to lag in the polls   With Tory morale low, Sunak used an interview this weekend to champion tax cuts, while also insisting that he was “up for the fight” despite Labour’s stubbornly large poll lead. He also argued his plans for the economy were working, saying it was “pointing in the right direction” and that the “future is going to be better”. But economists say they expect data on whether the economy has gone through two successive quarters of negative growth – the definition of a recession – to be on a knife-edge when it is released this week. A senior MP added that there had been no indication the party believed it could retain the two seats: “A number of people have commented that normally you are inundated with messages from the whips’ office requesting – and in some cases requiring – that you go to each byelection on at least three occasions. That hasn’t happened in either seat, which is quite incredible. “It’s going to be a difficult week. You’ve got the potential of the country going into recession and you’ve got the potential of inflation going up. Trouble is brewing for Rishi, I’m afraid.” Labour, meanwhile, was trying to play down suggestions that it will win easily in both byelections, as it sought to maximise turnout. Chris Bryant, the Labour frontbencher who is the “political lead” in Kingswood, said: “Everybody is assuming that, just because we have won a few byelections recently, that we are going to win here. A lot of people are undecided. We have to fight for every vote, door by door.” Tory strategists say that instead of pouring resources into the byelections, they are prioritising the party’s general election campaign. Rightwing Conservatives are increasingly focusing their hopes on chancellor Jeremy Hunt cutting tax in the budget, with their focus being inheritance tax. The party is also trying to coordinate attacks on Labour’s economic policies. However, a report on Labour’s windfall tax on oil and gas companies, published on Saturday, appeared to admit it referred to a policy that Labour no longer held. “This policy costing was completed and signed off on 22 January 2024,” it states. “Since then further announcements have been made by the Labour party, which would impact the costs of this policy.” Labour said the Tories had “costed somebody’s policy, but it is not Labour’s”. The news comes amid initial signs that Labour’s huge U-turn on spending £28bn a year on green investment has not dented the party’s poll lead. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that Labour’s lead stands at 18 points – up 2 points from a fortnight ago. Keir Starmer now has an 11-point lead with regard to who voters think would make the best prime minister. The Tory campaign has been hamstrung in Wellingborough, where the local party insisted on selecting the partner of ousted Tory MP Peter Bone, who was removed after a watchdog found he had bullied a staff member and exposed his genitals to them, which Bone denies. “It has not gone well,” said one senior Tory. “MPs would rather that we had more resources to put into their seats that they have to defend at the general election.” In Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, where Conservative MP Chris Skidmore resigned over Sunak’s plan for a new law that “promotes the production of new oil and gas”, Labour is also the strong favourite in the seat. Over the past week Tory MPs were left frustrated by a series of errors by Sunak. Some complained of the prime minister’s decision to deride Starmer in the House of Commons over Labour’s position on transgender people while the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery. Others despaired of a party political broadcast in which Sunak used a whiteboard to explain his plans for the country. One departing MP said the week had been “very bleak”."

        "content": "Labour MPs are warning they face a growing challenge from a well-funded slate of independent candidates opposed to Keir Starmer’s position on the Israel-Gaza war, amid an increasingly coordinated campaign in the build-up to the next election. With several MPs warning they continue to face anger over the party’s handling of its position on the Middle East, the Observer has been told that meetings have been taking place in recent days to identify, fund and champion a list of independent candidates to take on Labour MPs who failed to back an immediate ceasefire in a parliamentary vote last November. The Bethnal Green and Bow seat in east London, held by the shadow business minister Rushanara Ali, is among the constituencies being discussed. An independent candidate has already been installed to stand against shadow health secretary Wes Streeting in Ilford North, with a major fundraising campaign already under way to back her. One MP said that the funds being talked about were substantial and would cause concern among colleagues with large Muslim populations, as well as those with a significant share of voters willing to back a candidate to the left of Labour. It is understood a meeting about running rival candidates, which included potential financial backers, was held in London last week. “People are talking to some independent candidates and donating serious amounts of money to help them run against the Labour party,” said one MP. “It’s astonishing – I’ve never known this level of funding and organisation. The anger is off the scale. We have to do so much to get those communities back on side. They want to teach the Labour party a lesson.” Another MP who voted in favour of a ceasefire said: “There is a lot of anger. There is more organisation taking place than ever before – it’s not yet clear where that goes. It isn’t just the Muslim community. Liberal voters are also exercised about this. It isn’t necessarily that these candidates will win – but could they take important votes away?” Labour MPs have already been alerted to a new website, themuslimvote.co.uk, which is directing Muslim voters to back a slate of locally approved candidates. It states it is “focused on seats where the Muslim vote can influence the outcome” and will not back anyone “who voted against or abstained on the ceasefire vote”. It already lists a series of backers, including NGOs, community groups and Muslim-run businesses. Starmer initially refused to back a ceasefire last year, with Labour MPs told not to vote in favour of the SNP motion backing one. He also faced criticism for an interview in which he appeared to support Israel’s right to cut off power and water in Gaza. He later clarified this was not his view. Labour now supports a “sustainable ceasefire”, alongside the government. Given Labour’s dominant position in the opinion polls overall, political analysts have said there is little chance of potential seats being lost following a collapse in support from Muslim communities. Real nervousness remains among individual Labour MPs, with reports of some being barred from events in their constituencies over demands for Labour to strengthen its support for Gaza. The first test of the electoral impact of the issue will come later this month in the Rochdale byelection. George Galloway, the former Labour MP who previously secured a byelection victory in Bradford West in 2012, is running on a pro-Palestinian platform. While about one in three Rochdale voters is Muslim, Labour is widely expected to retain the seat. Several figures, including Jess Phillips, resigned from the frontbench to back a ceasefire last year. There are now rumours that the SNP is planning to hold another vote on the issue in the coming weeks. Some MPs appear to have changed their position in the wake of the original vote. John Cryer, the Leyton and Wanstead MP and chair of the parliamentary Labour party, did not back the SNP motion, but subsequently wrote to constituents saying “we should now be calling for a ceasefire”. Several concerned shadow ministers also attended a recent meeting with Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador in the UK. Figures in Starmer’s shadow cabinet are under serious pressure locally. Shabana Mahmood, the shadow justice secretary and one of Labour’s most senior Muslim MPs, said this week that there had been “a loss of trust” in her party among British Muslims and called for Labour to rebuild it. Some Labour MPs are already on edge after a recent poll suggested the party had lost more than a quarter of the Muslim voters that backed it at the last election. However, Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, said that while Labour risks losing “significant numbers of Muslim voters”, it was unlikely to lose “even a handful of seats” as a result at the coming election. “Labour is shielded from an immediate impact if they do gain three or four million voters nationally by being 10% up on the last general election,” he said. “The formative political experiences of young Muslim first-time voters may matter more in future general elections – if a Labour government becomes less popular in office than it is now in opposition, then it could become dangerous if it seems to take its diverse urban vote for granted. “The general election challenge for independent candidates is that almost no Westminster constituencies could be won with an appeal to a single minority group. Even where half the voters are Muslim, there is never going to be a 100% community block vote, so it will take a cross-community alliance of voters to win a seat. “The Muslim vote may matter most in 2024 where there are marginal seats with a large Muslim presence, such as in SNP-Labour marginals in Glasgow, or Conservative-held seats like Peterborough or Wycombe – not because they have the most Muslim voters but because minority votes can be the tipping point in a marginal seat.”"

        "content": "Labour is considering a ban on the sale of energy drinks to children if it wins power in the general election, it has been reported. The proposal has been put forward for inclusion in the party’s manifesto, according to Sky News, as concern grows about health risks to young people from high-caffeine products. The ban is not currently Labour policy, a source told the Guardian, and its manifesto commitments will be unveiled closer to the election, expected to take place in the autumn. A government-commissioned study reported that up to a third of UK children consume at least one energy drink each week. Popular among young people in particular, millions consume the products, which contain an average caffeine content of 150mg per litre as well as sugar, vitamins, minerals and amino acids. They are associated with insomnia and poor-quality sleep, according to a large study that suggests that just one can a month raises the risk of disturbed sleep, but are marketed as boosters of mental health and physical performance. The study, involving more than 53,000 people aged between 18 and 35 in Norway, shed fresh light earlier this year on potential negative effects. Researchers found those who consumed them every day slept about half an hour less than those drinking them occasionally or not at all.   Related: ‘Adults and kids pushed each other to grab as many bottles as they could’: how the world got hopped up on energy drinks    The higher the frequency of consumption, the fewer the hours of nightly sleep. But even just the occasional can – one to three times a month – is linked to a heightened risk of disturbed sleep, the researchers found. Their findings were published in the BMJ Open journal. Men who have two or three drinks a week were 35% more likely to have a bedtime after midnight, 52% more likely to sleep less than six hours and 60% more likely to wake in the night than those who rarely or never drank them. Women were 20% more likely to have a bedtime after midnight, 58% more likely to sleep less than six hours and 24% more likely to wake in the night. People who consume the drinks daily had more issues overall with waking after falling asleep, took longer to fall asleep and slept less overall than those not who do not drink them.  For women who drink energy drinks daily, 51% reported suffering insomnia, compared with 33% of women who occasionally or never drank them. Among men, 37% of daily drinkers suffered insomnia, compared with 22% of those who rarely or never had the drinks."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has said he is “up for the fight” as the Conservatives continue to lag far behind Labour in the polls. In an interview with the Times, the prime minister said hard work ought to be rewarded with tax cuts and that he would slash taxes as soon as it was “responsible to do so”. “At the beginning of this year there is a sense that the country is pointing in the right direction,” he told the newspaper. “Because economic conditions have improved, because the plan is working, you are starting to see mortgage rates come down and we have been able to cut taxes. “I do believe those pressures are starting to ease and that hopefully over the course of this year we can continue to make even more progress.” Hopes that a pre-election giveaway, as well as an improved economic outlook, will help close the polling gap on Keir Starmer’s Labour party are central to the prime minister’s optimism that he can turn his party’s fortunes around. A renewed promise to cut taxes came after the publication of his own tax summary showed his UK tax bill was more than £500,000 last year, as his total income rose to £2.2m. Critics pointed out that he paid the same effective tax rate, about 23% of his annual income, as a teacher, despite raking in millions more. That is because most of his earnings were in the form of capital gains, which is taxed at a lower rate than income. It comes as the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, sought to temper expectations about the size of tax reductions in his spring budget, despite clamouring within the Tory ranks for cuts. Sunak said: “None of us ever talk about this stuff before budgets. Other people are. I think they’re over-interpreting. What the chancellor and I have said is that of course our long-term plan is to cut people’s taxes.”   Related: Jeremy Hunt claims Nigel Lawson’s mantle as he teases tax cuts   The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, told the Times: “Rishi Sunak’s words will ring hollow to the millions of families across Britain who have been left worse off after 14 years of Conservative failure. “There have been 25 Tory tax rises since the election and the average household is set to be £1,200 worse off under Rishi Sunak’s tax plan. It’s time for a change and a Labour government with a plan to invest in Britain’s future.” Meanwhile, Sunak was described as out of touch earlier this week for accepting a £1,000 bet with broadcaster Piers Morgan on the success of the government’s Rwanda asylum scheme before the election. The former investment banker and hedge fund manager’s vast wealth was highlighted by the release of his tax documents on Friday. His total income was up 13% from the previous year, rising to £2.2m, and taking his total earnings over the last four years to about £7m. His effective tax rate of 23% is the same rate paid by a teacher on a salary of £41,600 a year, according to Tax Justice UK. Its executive director, Robert Palmer, said: “This is a feature of our broken tax system. At the moment, someone who earns most of their money from their wealth, like the prime minister, pays a much lower tax rate than someone who relies on going out to work for their living.” PA Media contributed to this report"

        "content": "Mental health inpatients have been told to attend jobcentre meetings relating to their benefits claims, including one claimant who was told to turn up for a work-related appointment, the Observer can reveal. Three patients at Forston clinic, an NHS mental health inpatient service near Dorchester, were told to attend meetings or risk their benefits being cut in recent months – sparking complaints from the local Citizens Advice branch, which has an adviser based at the clinic. Despite appearing to contradict national guidance from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), local jobcentre managers have refused requests from Citizens Advice Central Dorset to guarantee that no further demands of mental health inpatients will be made. “It’s just ridiculous. It’s beyond ridiculous,” Daphne Hall, south-west England representative at the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers (Nawra), told the Observer. “There should be no way somebody in hospital for whatever reason – mental health or physical – should be expected to attend a work-related appointment. They’re in hospital. They can’t possibly do that.”   Related: Gordon Brown slams ‘obscene’ levels of destitution in the UK   Last week employment minister Jo Churchill clarified that DWP guidance did not require hospital inpatients to attend jobcentre meetings, in response to a parliamentary question from Stephen Timms, chair of the work and pensions committee. “Anybody in those particular units, which are for seriously mentally ill people, should not be required to engage in any kind of work search, work preparation, work-related ­activities – they should be completely ­outside of that,” said Caroline Buxton, business and partnerships manager at Central Advice Central Dorset. “Surely the fact that he’s sectioned is enough to know this person is not at a stage in their claimant journey when they could come and discuss ‘Should I do an IT course?’ or whatever. This is just totally inappropriate.” Two of the patients did not have to attend after Citizens Advice intervened, while staff at the clinic decided to send a third patient to a jobcentre, so as not to delay their universal credit claim. “If [the meetings] didn’t go ahead, that was because we have some funding for a dedicated Citizens Advice adviser, able to be in that unit, picking up the phone or emailing somebody and saying: ‘Hey, what are you doing this for? Why are you asking this person to come?’” said Buxton. Universal credit claimants who are out of work and not judged to be severely disabled are generally required to look for work and attend face-to-face meetings otherwise they are “sanctioned” for a period of time and their benefits cut. But national DWP guidance on work-related requirements lists “mental health issues (eg low self-confidence and self-esteem, anxiety state or depression)” as a “complex need” that means “it would be unreasonable to expect [claimants] to meet their current work-related requirements”. “Putting any sort of pressure on somebody who’s going through a mental health crisis is likely to be extremely detrimental to their health,” Nawra’s Hall told the Observer. A DWP spokesperson said: “There are no references within our guidance which state we would require a hospital inpatient to attend a meeting at a jobcentre. “Work coaches have the discretion to personalise the work-related requirements for individual claimants based on the impact of their health condition. “In exceptional circumstances, where a claimant is absolutely prevented from making any commitments in return for receiving their benefit, the requirement to do so can be temporarily lifted. This includes, but is not limited to, instances where a claimant is undergoing medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital.”"

        "content": "Sandwiched between speeches by Jacob-Rees Mogg and Lee Anderson, a less familiar figure took to the stage at Tuesday’s launch of the Popular Conservatives group. Looking slightly nervous, she glanced at her notes and began: “Margaret Thatcher … ”\nAnyone wondering about Mhairi Fraser’s political views even after those opening words were soon left in no doubt, as the Conservative candidate for the safe Surrey constituency of Epsom and Ewell launched into a full-throated attack on the “nanny state”.\nThe former parliamentary staffer turned City lawyer lambasted Rishi Sunak’s policy to ban smoking, saying – in a point that public health experts may quibble with – that there was no link between controls on tobacco and smoking rates.\nFraser went on to call Covid lockdowns “the nanny in her most monstrous form”, arguing that if people choose to have “a cigarette after a long day at work” then officials should just keep out and let them do it.\nConservative conference attenders will have heard full-fat libertarianism espoused many times, especially at fringe events. What was interesting about Fraser’s brief, six-minute speech, is what it may say about a post-election Tory party.\nFraser overcame tough competition in January to be adopted for ex-minister Chris Grayling’s old seat, and is very likely to make it into the Commons, even if a heavy defeat pares the parliamentary Conservatives to a rump of MPs.\nOnce there, her long history in the party, beginning as what one peer called “your classic low-tax tartan Tory” in the University of Edinburgh’s Young Conservatives, could see Fraser shape its trajectory in the post-Sunak era.\nAnd if Fraser is an augury of things to come, then this future could be distinctly populist, even Trump-like. Shortly before her speech to the PopCons, the Liz Truss-helmed Tory fringe group, Fraser made headlines after comments she made in 2016 about the former US president re-emerged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFraser, then working for the Conservative Young Women organisation, told STV she had “never been as excited about a political candidate as I am about Trump” and that she planned to travel to the US for the election.\n“I don’t see Russia as a natural enemy,” she added, saying she backed Trump’s plan to instead focus on Islamist groups.\nWhile Fraser has backed away from this stance – a “friend” told the Times, which unearthed the comments, that “a lot has changed” in the intervening eight years – such leaning into populist concerns could help her fit well as a new MP into a party led by someone such as Kemi Badenoch or Suella Braverman.\nFraser was educated at private schools in Hong Kong and Bangkok, and has three siblings.\nAfter university, she worked in parliament and took a series of other politics-related jobs, taking time off to finish a very distant third in the North Lanarkshire seat of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill in the 2015 general election.\nSeveral people who knew Fraser at the time said that while it was no secret she was a Conservative, if she was already an unfettered libertarian she kept this to herself.\n“She’s genuinely lovely, a very nice human being,” one person who worked with her said. “That’s partly why I was a bit appalled to turn on the TV this week and see her hanging out with Liz and co.”\nAnother said: “She was always very hard-working and diligent, so I expected big things. But it’s fair to say this was a surprise.”\nWhile her current views may make her popular within the party, it remains to be seen if this would be the case with voters more widely.\nTim Bale, the professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, and a historian of the Conservative party, said libertarianism had a long if not always successful history for them.\n“It goes right back to the 19th century, when the Liberal party was very much seen as the party of interfering do-gooders and the Tory party was seen as the friend of the common man and the good life, partly in alliance with the brewers,” he said.\nWhile Truss and her allies argue her radical free market ideas have majority support, “in fact all the polling suggests it’s very much a kind of minority pursuit”, Bale said.\n“Neoliberalism is shared by very, very few voters. And throwing off the constraints of the nanny state doesn’t actually square with polling either.”"

He has personally donated £119,500 to the party and another £56,500 through his company. A series of reports named Marks as among those nominated for peerages in Johnson’s resignation honours list, along with MPs including Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams. However, Marks, Dorries and Adams were among several names reportedly removed from the list.   Related: Labour pledges to ‘clean up politics’ after outrage over Liz Truss honours list   Another donor handed a peerage on Friday night – as the Commons began a week of recess – was Franck Petitgas, who has worked for Rishi Sunak as a special adviser on business and investment. He has previously given £35,000 to the Conservatives. Other new Tory peers include Paul Goodman, the former MP who edits the ConservativeHome website; the businesswoman and disability campaigner Rosa Monckton; and two senior councillors – John Fuller, leader of South Norfolk council, and James Jamieson, formerly chair of the Local Government Association. Labour nominated four people for peerages, including Ayesha Hazarika, the broadcaster who was formerly a special adviser; John Hannett, head of the Usdaw shopworkers’ union, Jane Ramsey, the Labour party’s former standards and ethics adviser, and lawyer Gerald Shamash, who is solicitor to the Labour party. Plaid Cymru nominated one peer, Carmen Smith, a former chief of staff in the Welsh Senedd, who is aged 27. The new nominations push the size of the Lords to only a few peers away from 800 – there were 784 peers still active before the latest crop. It is the biggest legislative chamber in the world apart from China’s National People’s Congress. A series of reports and recommendations have suggested the upper house be cut in size. A committee set up by the then-lord speaker, Norman Fowler, recommended in 2017 that it be reduced to no more than 600 members, with new peers limited to 15-year terms. However, since then a series of prime ministers have created yet more peers, some of whom have been more active and diligent than others. A Guardian analysis in 2022 found that of 318 possible sittings that newspaper proprietor Evgeny Lebedev could have attended since Johnson made him a peer, he had been to four, 1.25% of the total. In the four-plus years since he was made a peer in November 2019, Lebedev has spoken twice, totally less than 10 minutes in all, and never voted."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak paid more than half a million pounds in tax in 2023 after making a £1.8m profit on his holding in a US investment fund, a summary of his tax affairs shows. The prime minister published the document on Friday, showing he paid a tax bill of £508,308 in the financial year 2022-23 on overall earnings and gains of £2.23m. This means he paid an effective tax rate of 23% in the UK – much lower than the top rate of 45% – because some income was taxed at source in the US and the rate of capital gains tax is lower at 20%. Sunak has in effect been raising income taxes because of the freeze on the tax thresholds and the temporary rise in national insurance, but headline rates on capital gains have remained unchanged during his time as chancellor and then prime minister. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) tweeted after the release: “It really is a mystery why Rishi Sunak raised income tax but not capital gains tax.” His £139,477 salary as prime minister represents just 7% of his total income that year. In addition to the £1.8m gain, he received a £276,218 dividend, and £17,189 of interest on savings and an investment fund in the US. The tax return will raise questions about why Sunak appears to hold much of his wealth in the US rather than the UK. According to the summary provided by Sunak’s accountants, those investments were held under a “blind management arrangement”, which meant he did not receive the gains as income but had to pay tax on them nevertheless. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, published his tax return at the same time. It showed he paid tax of £117,418 on income of £208,547 plus a capital gain of £208,058. Within his earnings, Hunt made £27,370 from a rental property and £35,997 in dividend income. Sunak first published his tax return in 2023, showing he had made nearly £5m over the previous three years due mostly to his US investment fund income. Sunak’s personal wealth and his links to the US have been a sensitive issue for the prime minister. A former Goldman Sachs banker and hedge fund manager, he joined one of India’s richest families when he married Akshata Murty, the daughter of Narayana, the billionaire founder of Infosys. Sunak was criticised in April 2022 after it emerged he had held a US green card while in office – meaning he had declared himself a “permanent US resident” for tax purposes for 19 months while he was chancellor and for six years as an MP. Murty was also criticised when it emerged she was a non-dom, and she subsequently pledged to pay tax on all worldwide income in future. The prime minister and his family own several properties, including the home in his constituency of Richmond, in North Yorkshire, a Grade II-listed manor with a private lake and a new heated swimming pool. The pool will make such a large demand for energy that Sunak had to pay for the local electricity network to be upgraded. Robert Palmer, the executive director at Tax Justice UK, said: “People will be shocked to learn the prime minister has such a low tax rate despite bringing in millions. But this is a feature of our broken tax system. At the moment someone who earns most of their money from their wealth – like the prime minister – pays a much lower tax rate than someone who relies on going out to work for their living. We need to fix this to make sure that income from wealth is taxed at the same rate as income from work.”"

        "content": "  4.59pm GMT  End of day summary  Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day:  Ministers have held talks about an alternative to Rishi Sunak’s plan to exonerate those wrongfully convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal. No 10 insisted it was pressing ahead with the bill announced last month, which would immediately quash the convictions of hundreds of post office operators. The British Medical Association (BMA) has announced further junior doctor strikes in England, from February 24 to 28. The union said the government had “failed to meet the deadline to put an improved pay offer on the table”. More than 100,000 patients in England face having their NHS care cancelled this month due to the fresh wave of strike action. Health leaders expressed alarm, warning the five-day walkout would jeopardise all efforts to tackle the record waiting list and push other services to “breaking point”. Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, has spoken of receiving death threats after she was described by former Tory MP Nadine Dorries as aligned to a plot controlling the top of the Conservative party. Badenoch said death threats had intensified since the publication of Dorries’s book The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson. Rachel Reeves has defended Labour’s U-turn on its pledge to spend £28bn a year on green projects. The shadow chancellor blamed the Tories and the economic impact of Liz Truss’s mini-budget, as she told BBC Breakfast she would not “make any apologies” for fiscal responsibility. Keir Starmer said he believes the British public “appreciate” Labour being “straight” about its plans for the economy, after the party announced a major U-turn on its green spending pledge. Rishi Sunak again refused to apologise for his transgender jibe at Keir Starmer in the Commons this week, rebuffing calls from Peter Spooner, Brianna’s Ghey’s father, for him to say sorry. The prime minister, appearing on BBC Radio Somerset, rejected the idea he had been making a joke. Brianna Ghey’s murder has “humanised the debate” around transgender people in her native Warrington, and stopped local Conservative politicians from using trans issues for “culture war” attacks, according to Brianna’s local Labour MP. Rishi Sunak has published his personal tax return. The tax return shows that the prime minister paid more than half a million pounds in UK tax last year.  We are closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us.      4.46pm GMT   Ed Miliband has insisted he did not consider resigning over Labour’s junking of its pledge to spend £28 billion a year on green projects. The shadow climate secretary, seen as a key proponent of the policy, said the party’s plans still meet his criteria of moving the dial on climate, PA News reports. He was said to have argued strongly for sticking with the £28bn figure as the Labour leadership considered a U-turn. But he publicly rowed in behind Keir Starmer as the Labour leader announced its axing. Asked whether he thought about quitting over the issue, Miliband told Channel 4 News on Friday:  Absolutely not. Because the test I apply is are we going to go into the next election, if we’re the next government, am I going to be able to be the energy secretary who can genuinely say Britain is leading the world? Britain is going to move the dial on climate and that is the test. That’s why I’m in frontline politics because I care so much about this cause and my test of what we’ve come up with is - does meet the criteria I have? And absolutely it does.  He argued Labour still has a “massive agenda to invest in the future of the country” and that he has a “responsibility” to “make a difference” should he become energy secretary. He said:  The only thing I can do, the only right thing to do, is to fight for the maximum possible ambition. And to make sure that in government we can make a difference. I’m confident we can.      4.44pm GMT   Rishi Sunak has published his personal tax return. The tax return shows that the prime minister paid more than half a million pounds in UK tax last year.  Updated at 4.49pm GMT    4.38pm GMT  Ministers discuss alternative plan to exonerate Post Office Horizon victims  Ministers have held talks about an alternative to Rishi Sunak’s plan to exonerate those wrongfully convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal. No 10 insisted it was pressing ahead with the bill announced last month, which would immediately quash the convictions of hundreds of post office operators. But this week the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, and business minister, Kevin Hollinrake, held discussions about an alternative put forward by the judiciary, under which the courts would overturn wrongful convictions, a process likely to take much longer. Some senior lawyers have expressed concerns that quashing convictions by statute sets a dangerous precedent by allowing parliament and politicians to overturn the decisions of courts. Critics also say it lumps together innocent and guilty. At least three MPs and one peer were briefed by ministers about the details of the alternative option. A fourth MP was told by a senior minister that the government was examining a new approach. The alternative plan would bundle together wrongful convictions and overturn them through the court system, according to four people briefed on the details. They all said the new plan would require some more limited legislation. The fact that the judiciary has proposed an alternative demonstrates the concern among its members. But Downing Street said the alternative route would not deliver swift justice to post office operators. A government spokesperson said:  The prime minister was clear – we will introduce primary legislation that will exonerate those impacted by the historic Horizon scandal.  A different government spokesperson said:  Ministers are absolutely committed to introducing new primary legislation to make sure that those prosecuted by the Post Office are swiftly exonerated.  Read more on this exclusive from my colleagues Eleni Courea and Pippa Crerar here:   Related: Ministers discuss alternative plan to exonerate Post Office Horizon victims       3.48pm GMT   My colleague Rowena Mason has the full story on Kemi Badenoch’s comments about Nadine Dorries in The Times. Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, has spoken of receiving death threats after she was described by former Tory MP Nadine Dorries as aligned to a plot controlling the top of the Conservative party. Badenoch said death threats had intensified since the publication of Dorries’s book The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson, which claims a sinister cabal called “the movement” have “set out to control the destiny of the Conservative party” for 25 years. In an interview with the Times, Badenoch said: “She [Dorries] thinks she’s just writing stuff, but people who have that kind of mindset latch on to it. “If you get the unhelpful coalition of mental health issues and propensity to violence, then you read the Nadine Dorries conspiracy theory and decide you want to kill someone, it’s very, very nasty.” Badenoch is a political ally of Michael Gove, who is portrayed by Dorries as part of the plot along with a Conservative aide, Dougie Smith, and former adviser Dominic Cummings. However, the business secretary suggested in the interview that her friendship with Gove has suffered recently. “He did something that was very, very annoying,” she said. Asked whether it had ended their friendship, she said: “It’s not what it used to be, but he’s somebody I have to work with.” The business secretary also complained that she is portrayed by Dorries as a puppet of Gove “as if I have no thoughts and no opinions of my own”, adding: “Like they’re saying, ‘She’s not that bright. It’s some man who is doing this.’” In relation to the idea that she is manipulated by powerful men, Badenoch said her husband, Hamish, was more of an influence: “If there’s somebody who is doing that, wouldn’t it be the person who goes to bed with me every night and pays for my home and so on? Hamish is a huge influence on how I do things. Which I think is right, because this job affects his life.” Read more here:   Related: Kemi Badenoch says death threats intensified after Nadine Dorries book       3.19pm GMT   My colleagues Kiran Stacey and Eleni Courea have analysed Starmer’s plans to create a “bombproof” manifesto.  Labour has spent the past few weeks performing a series of U-turns on previously announced policies as it finalises its manifesto, culminating in Thursday’s announcement of a huge cut to its green spending plans. Beyond the cuts to the £28bn annual spending pledge, party insiders have also let it be known they no longer intend to abolish the House of Lords, might reduce their planned tax on private equity profits and will not legislate to create a National Care Service. All this is part of Starmer’s plans to create a “bombproof” manifesto, which he set out at the end of last year and is intended to ensure the party is ready in case the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, calls an election in May. That process reached its first major deadline on Thursday, but is likely to dominate much of the leadership’s thinking for several months to come. “Part of the timing around today … is that all the shadow cabinet had to have their final proposals in today, fully funded, so that we can start putting them together for a manifesto,” Starmer told reporters on Thursday as he laid out the reasons for dropping the £28bn-a-year green plans. A shadow minister added: “The [£28bn] green prosperity plan looked like a massive slush fund so it didn’t survive bomb-proofing.” Starmer and his advisers have a sense of the main elements of the manifesto. The remaining green pledges, including a publicly owned energy supplier and a green sovereign wealth fund, remain. So does a set of proposals to strengthen trade union rights and employment protections known as the “new deal for working people” – despite pressure from corporate lobbyists to drop it. More retail proposals will include a promise to set up free breakfast clubs in every primary school and to use money from taxing non-doms to train more nurses and midwives.

The former MP and author shared a screenshot of a small part of the interview where Badenoch claims Dorries suggested she ought to be running for mayor of London rather than as an MP, leaving her livid and feeling that Dorries was putting her back in her “urban” box and setting a cap on her ambition. Dorries claims in a further tweet that it was not her suggestion that Badenoch run for London mayor but a party donor who was involved in the interview process for Mayoral candidates.   Kemi Baddenoch gives an interview in the Times today where she obsesses slightly about THE PLOT and makes this untrue claim. I’ll post the WhatsApp exchange next to prove it. pic.twitter.com/9wAoywk7cA— Rt Hon Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorries) February 9, 2024    Updated at 2.26pm GMT    1.43pm GMT   Sinn Fein’s Stormont first minister Michelle O’Neill said her attendance at a police graduation ceremony “fulfils” her commitment to be first minister for all. Speaking at the event in Belfast, O’Neill said:   It’s a great day for the six graduates who have now been attested this afternoon and I wish them the very best for their future career in policing. I think it’s so important that our policing service reflects the diversity of our society that we have, so I wanted to be here and be part of wishing these new constables the very best in their journey. I became first minister last Saturday. I said I would be a first minister for all and that includes these new constables who have graduated today. I also think it fulfils my commitment of being first minister for all. When the invite came in for today, I wanted to be here because it is such an important time.      1.26pm GMT   The government must increase fines on utility companies that dig up pavements for roadworks, then pour in concrete rather than fixing the mess, a government adviser has said. Telecoms and water companies are creating “street scars” in a “wasteful process” that is marring British high streets, Nicholas Boys Smith, who chairs the Office for Place in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has said in a report. He uses the term “street scars” to describe black or grey slabs of concrete that disfigure the paving of streets and pavements, examples of which can be seen all over the UK. Boys Smith told the Guardian: “It’s a ridiculous and wasteful process. One set of workers turn up and ruin the road. And then, if you’re lucky, months later another set turn up and put it back together again.” The government adviser, who runs the thinktank Create Streets, blamed the privatisation of utility companies for the number of street scars.   Related: Call for UK utility firms to face higher fines for ‘street scars’ on pavements       12.58pm GMT   Keir Starmer called on the prime minister to resolve the dispute with junior doctors and end the strike. He told broadcasters:  I don’t want these strikes to go ahead. I don’t think anybody who uses the NHS wants the strikes to go ahead, I don’t think the doctors want them to go ahead. What I do want is for the government to get in the room and negotiate and bring this to an end. Around Christmas time they were dancing around saying ‘well, there may be a deal but we won’t go in the room first’. I thought that was pathetic. We now learn from officials that it is the prime minister himself who is personally blocking deals which could resolve this issue. I think the public will be frustrated, bordering on angry now, with the prime minister for letting this drag on for so long. Resolve it.      12.57pm GMT   Keir Starmer was pressed on Labour’s shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood’s claim that the party has seen a “loss of trust” from Muslim voters over its stance on the war in Gaza. He told broadcasters:  I think everyone can see that the conflict in the Middle East has caused great concern across the country, and in the end I think we all want to see the same thing. The terrible terrorist attack on October 7 – 27,000 people now have been killed in Gaza – that’s intolerable, many of them children. So we have to get to a ceasefire, a sustainable ceasefire, and that means stopping the fighting, creating the space for humanitarian aid to get in, which is desperately, desperately needed, getting the hostages out and creating the first step of the process, the only way this will be resolved, which is a two-state solution.  You can follow our liveblog on the Middle East crisis here:   Related: Middle East crisis live: Destruction in Gaza a ‘war crime’, says top UN diplomat; starving people there ‘eating grass’, charity says       12.55pm GMT   Keir Starmer defended his decision to extend the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. He told broadcasters:  What I have done is go to Aberdeen and talk to the oil and gas industry for a two-day intensive discussion about the transition that we want to make, which is going to have to be made. They know that, they’re investing a huge amount in renewables. What they want is a government that is going to work with them on that transition and that is why the British jobs bonus is so important, because I want to ensure that as we transition we get the new jobs of the future and don’t lose any jobs. So yes I’ve been having those discussions with them, very productive discussions, because I want to ensure that those jobs in Scotland are preserved and we add further jobs too.      12.54pm GMT  Starmer says British public 'appreciate' Labour being 'straight' with them over major U-turn  Keir Starmer said he believes the British public “appreciate” Labour being “straight” about its plans for the economy, after the party announced a major U-turn on its green spending pledge. Speaking on a trip to the West Midlands, the Labour leader said:  Every family knows that they’ve had to adjust their plans. We’ve now had to adjust our plans. And I think the British public appreciate us being straight and saying because of the damage the Tories have done, we can’t now do everything that we wanted to do. I would much rather be straight with the British public than make a promise I can’t keep.  Asked whether there was anything he could guarantee would be in the party manifesto come the election expected this year, Starmer said:  Since we announced the green prosperity plan, we’ve made a number of very important commitments to gigafactories, to tidal development, to Great British energy... national wealth fund... all of the commitments I’ve made on outcomes, they all remain, and they’re fully costed.  He added:  What we’re not going to do is make further announcements of further investment. Everything we’ve announced so far... all of that remains.” about its plans for the economy, after the party announced a major U-turn on its green spending pledge.   Updated at 12.56pm GMT    12.23pm GMT   Raising the state retirement age to 71 would condemn millions of middle-aged people to misery as they get older, Britain’s biggest independent organisation of older people and a former pensions minister have said. The National Pensioners Convention (NPC), which represents more than 1.15 million members, said the proposals “in no way reflects the harsh reality of getting older in the UK”. The general secretary, Jan Shortt, said: “These proposals will affect everyone currently in their early-50s and younger, and will considerably add to the one in four pensioners already living in poverty. They will condemn even more people to a miserable retirement, as well as increasing pressure on already struggling public services.” Shortt said the proposals favoured only higher-income groups because although the number of people living longer had been increasing, the number of those living with ill-health – and therefore not able to work longer – was also rising. She said:  Making those already living with ill-health wait even longer to claim their pension will only increase poverty and the demand on already-creaking services, such as health and care.  Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, agreed. She said:  Raising the state pension age to 71 should be unconscionable. Only the top 10% of the UK population stay healthy into their early 70s, so cutting costs by making unwell workers wait longer, favours the well-pensioned, higher paid. Chronological age is too inflexible as a unique criterion of eligibility for a state pension, which is part of every worker’s social contract. In addition, neither the NHS nor the UK labour market are prepared for this policy – the former because of the big health differentials across the country and the second, because it is rife with ageism.  Read the full story here:   Related: Raising UK state pension age to 71 will bring ‘misery’ to millions       11.52am GMT   Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said Rishi Sunak bears responsibility for the latest planned strike by junior doctors. He said:  Rishi Sunak is personally blocking a deal with the junior doctors. He bears responsibility for the cancelled operations and appointments desperate patients will face once again. This can’t go on. Patients are desperate and staff are worn out. If the Conservatives have given up on governing, they should step aside so Labour can get the NHS back on its feet.      11.45am GMT   Rishi Sunak has criticised local councils for putting up council tax too much, even as authorities struggle to cope with funding shortfalls that have left several on the brink of bankruptcy. The prime minister criticised councils in England for requesting permission to raise council tax by more than 5% as they look to balance their budgets amid a national crisis in local authority funding. Council leaders looking to raise tax by more than the 5% cap either have to be granted permission from central government or hold a local referendum on doing so. Bedfordshire is the only council ever to have held such a referendum, holding a vote in 2015 in which local residents rejected the idea of higher tax rates. This week the government granted permission to a series of councils to raise taxes by more than the 5% cap, including Thurrock, Woking, Slough and Birmingham. Ministers refused to allow Somerset to do the same, however, as council leaders there look to close a £100m budget deficit. Sunak told BBC Radio Somerset:  It’s important that councils manage the cost of living for their residents, and councils that are asking the government to just allow them to whack in incredibly high council tax rises – [that] is not right. We can strike the balance between councils raising the money they need, but making sure they don’t unnecessarily burden people.

Ministers, health officials and representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA) had been locked in negotiations for weeks since last month’s record six-day stoppage, trying to find a resolution to the pay dispute. But the Guardian understands a last-ditch meeting on Thursday between Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, and the BMA failed to result in any immediate solution to end the stoppages. As a result, the BMA’s junior doctors’ committee has voted unanimously for another five days of strikes this month. Junior doctors in England will strike from 7am on 24 February to midnight on 28 February. The decision was announced a day after the latest NHS figures revealed that 7.6m health treatments were waiting to be carried out in England at the end of December, relating to 6.37 million patients. The announcement from the BMA will alarm medical leaders and NHS bosses, who are becoming increasingly concerned about the deteriorating health of many of those stuck on waiting lists. The Guardian revealed last month a warning from health officials that thousands of cancer patients could die early if ministers and junior doctors did not urgently resolve their bitter pay row. On Thursday, the latest performance statistics showed more than a third of cancer patients in England were facing potentially deadly delays, with thousands of people forced to wait months to begin treatment. Earlier this week Rishi Sunak was accused of personally holding up a deal to end doctors’ strikes despite warnings from the health department and NHS England that waiting lists would continue to soar unless the dispute was resolved. Read the full story here:   Related: Junior doctors in England to strike again after pay talks break down       11.28am GMT  Junior doctors 'not ready to be reasonable', says health secretary  The planned strike action by junior doctors shows that they are not “ready to be reasonable,” Victoria Atkins has said.  In a statement, the health and social care secretary said:  I want to find a reasonable solution that ends strike action. This action called by the BMA junior doctor committee does not signal that they are ready to be reasonable. We already provided them with a pay increase of up to 10.3% and were prepared to go further. We urged them to put an offer to their members, but they refused. We are also open to further discussions on improving doctors’ and the wider workforce’s working lives. I want to focus on cutting waiting times for patients rather than industrial action. We have been making progress with waiting lists falling for three months in a row. Five days of action will put enormous pressure on the NHS and is not in the spirit of constructive dialogue. To make progress I ask the Junior Doctors Committee to cancel their action and come back to the table to find a way forward for patients and our NHS.   Updated at 11.31am GMT    11.15am GMT   BMA junior doctors’ committee co-chairs Robert Laurenson and Vivek Trivedi said in a statement:  We have made every effort to work with the government in finding a fair solution to this dispute whilst trying to avoid strike action. Even yesterday, we were willing to delay further strike action in exchange for a short extension of our current strike mandate. Had the health secretary agreed to this, an act of good faith on both sides, talks could have gone ahead without more strikes. Sadly, the government declined. The glacial speed of progress with the government is frustrating and incomprehensible. The health secretary was quite clear in media interviews during our last action that she would meet us ‘in 20 minutes’ when no strikes were planned. She also made clear that she had a further offer to make. It turned out to be more than 20 days before we were offered a meeting with a minister. When we did it wasn’t with the Health Secretary, and there was no offer on the table. Time has been lost that could have been used to negotiate with us, or at least with the Treasury and the prime minister for the mandate to make a credible offer. From the very start of the industrial action, we have been clear that there is no need for strike action as long as substantial progress is made, and we remain willing to carry on talking and to cancel the forthcoming strikes if significant progress is made and a credible offer is put forward.  The BMA said the new round of strikes would be the last on their current mandate with members but “we are already balloting for six months more”.     11.09am GMT  Junior doctors to strike in England again from 24-28 February  The British Medical Association (BMA) has announced further junior doctor strikes in England, from February 24 to 28. The union said the government had “failed to meet the deadline to put an improved pay offer on the table,” PA News reports. It added:   In a show of goodwill, the BMA provided the Health Secretary with an option to delay further strike action. She was asked to extend the current strike mandate for a short period - and thus allow talks to continue with the aim to achieve a resolution for this year’s dispute. Disappointingly, she declined to agree to extending the mandate.  The BMA said the strikes could still be called off “if a credible offer is made”.  Updated at 11.31am GMT    11.07am GMT  Kemi Badenoch says death threats have 'intensified' since publication of Nadine Dorries book  Kemi Badenoch has said she has received more death threats since the release of The Plot, Nadine Dorries explosive book on the downfall of Boris Johnson. In The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson, Dorries put forward elaborate conspiracies about those at the top of government and claimed a sinister cabal called “the movement” have “set out to control the destiny of the Conservative party” for 25 years. Badenoch made the comments in a profile interview with The Times. While being interviewed, the business secretary showed journalist Janice Turner a phone message from her Westminster office manager reporting a death threat to the police. These threats have intensified, she said.  She [Dorries] thinks she’s just writing stuff, but people who have that kind of mindset latch on to it. If you get the unhelpful coalition of mental health issues and propensity to violence, then you read the Nadine Dorries conspiracy theory and decide you want to kill someone, it’s very, very nasty.  She pointed out that Dorries, who blames Badenoch for abetting the downfall of Johnson when she resigned as cabinet minister, claimed in The Plot that the minister is being manoeuvred by powerful men and portrays her as a puppet of Michael Gove. “As if I have no thoughts and no opinions of my own,” Badenoch said, complaining that her best speeches are attributed to him. “Like they’re saying, ‘She’s not that bright. It’s some man who is doing this.’”  Updated at 1.20pm GMT    10.36am GMT   Scotland’s hospitals have experienced “a significant fall in productivity” despite record spending and staffing levels, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned, and are making slow progress to recover from the Covid pandemic.A new IFS analysis has found Scotland’s NHS, which is run by the devolved government in Edinburgh, handled 8% fewer elective patients, 8% fewer outpatient appointments and 21% fewer emergency admissions in the second quarter of 2023 compared to pre-pandemic. That was despite Scottish health spending being 10% higher in real terms, with 9% more hospital consultants and 6% more nurses, than in 2019. The number of people on elective waiting lists has leapt by 87% since the start of the pandemic.While England’s NHS has worse A&E and elective waiting times, its staffing and spending levels are increasing faster and its recovery from the Covid crisis has been faster. In the first half of 2023, England’s hospitals provided 4% more outpatient appointments than in 2019, while Scotland’s delivered 6% fewer.NHS funding in England is also growing at a far greater rate, comparatively, closing the gap on per capita spending. At the start of devolution, Scotland spent 22% more than England; in 2019, the gap was 3%.These findings raise questions about Scottish government rhetoric around NHS reform. Humza Yousaf, the first minister, and former health secretary, hit back at Scottish Labour revelations in Holyrood yesterday that 12,000 died waiting for ambulances or emergency treatment in Scotland last year by asserting spending and staffing were at an all-time high.Max Warner, a co-author of the IFS study, said cuts in bed numbers, sicker patients and continuing Covid hospitalisations contributed to the situation. He said:  Without a substantial boost to hospital productivity, there is a risk that even additional funding and staffing will not bring the Scottish NHS back to pre-pandemic performance.      10.20am GMT   Brianna Ghey’s murder has “humanised the debate” around transgender people in her native Warrington, and stopped local Conservative politicians from using trans issues for “culture war” attacks, according to Brianna’s local Labour MP. Charlotte Nichols, elected to parliament in Warrington North in 2019, said:  Most people haven’t necessarily met a trans person. And I think what happened to Brianna really gave people someone that they identify with and made them think about some of these issues with an actual human being.  Nichols said the discussion about transgender identities was “very abstract” for most people, but that her constituents had collectively grieved for a transgender girl and learned that being trans “isn’t something that’s bad or scary”. She added:  It has really humanised the debate.  The MP said her local Conservative opponents would now not dream of following the lead of Rishi Sunak, who joked at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that Keir Starmer could not define a woman. Sunak has refused to apologise for the jibe, made as Brianna’s mother was sitting in the public gallery with Nichols. Nichols said:  I did previously find myself getting flak from local opposition parties if I raised LGBT issues. They would say, ‘this isn’t important’ or ‘you’re woke’ or whatever, the usual nonsense. That is not a thing that is said any more. It would be seen as being hurtful to Brianna’s family and her friends.  She noted that while she was mocked by some in the national media for a recent parliamentary question about trans people, the local Warrington Guardian reported it supportively. Nichols asked the minister for women and equalities to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 to allow transgender people who are deceased to be legally remembered by the gender they lived by. The MP said Brianna’s parents, Esther Ghey and Peter Spooner, had set a powerful example by being so open about their love for their daughter, who transitioned when she was 14.

He said:  I think what Labour announced yesterday just demonstrates what we’ve been saying - they absolutely don’t have a plan. Their signature economic policy is in tatters, and when you don’t have a plan, you can’t deliver any change for the country. In contrast, our plan is working. If you look at what’s happening with the economy, inflation has come down from 11% to 4%. Mortgage rates are starting to come down, wages are rising and, because of that, we’ve been able to start cutting people’s taxes. So someone earning £35,000 getting a tax cut of £450 kicked in in January, that shows that when you have a plan, you can make a difference. And if we stick to our plan, I can give everyone that peace of mind that the future is going to be better. And as we saw yesterday, the alternative is the Labour Party who have no plan and that means no change and just going back to square one.   Updated at 10.08am GMT    9.55am GMT   Rishi Sunak was grilled on potholes and the lack of NHS dental care during an appearance on BBC Radio Devon. The prime minister, who is on a visit to the South West, brushed off criticism of his dental recovery plan from the British Dental Association (BDA), telling the station:  Everyone will have their views, I’m confident that it will make a difference. It’s a significant amount of money. It’s two-and-a-half million appointments, which will take us back to pre-Covid levels.  On Thursday, the BDA said the government’s recovery plan was “unworthy of the title”, stating nothing in it can meet the government’s stated objectives of providing NHS care to all who need it, or the prime minister’s pledge to “restore” NHS dentistry. Pressed on claims government funding to fix potholes is only a “drop in the ocean”, Sunak said:  Well, I think the numbers I’ve got show that it’s growing next year. And that’s why we have to make priorities and decisions right. Obviously, I think everyone knows there isn’t a bottomless pit for these things.   Updated at 9.56am GMT    9.48am GMT   The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has hinted at plans to launch a tax-free “British Isa” investing in UK company shares at the spring budget, as part of efforts to revive the country’s stock market. A British stock Isa would allow investors to buy a certain amount of UK company shares, without paying tax. Currently, the government charges a 0.5% tax, known as the share purchase stamp duty, for any shares bought in the UK. It comes as Hunt tries to find cost-free announcements that could help win over voters and businesses as the Tories lag well behind Labour in the polls before a much-anticipated general election. The incentive, which some expected Hunt to announce as part of the autumn statement last November, could also complement government plans to sell shares in NatWest – which is still 38.6% government owned since its 2008 taxpayer bailout – to retail investors later this year.

Brianna, 16, was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered in February last year. Last Friday, Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were jailed for at least 22 and 20 years respectively. Ratcliffe was found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna’s transgender identity. Sunak is under continued pressure to apologise for making a joke at the expense of transgender people at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, just after he was told by the Labour leader, Starmer, that Brianna’s mother, Esther Ghey, was in the public gallery. The prime minister, appearing on BBC Radio Somerset, rejected the idea he had been making a joke. He told the station:  That is not what I did, it is wrong to say that. What happened was a tragedy and using that to try and detract from the completely separate and very clear point I was making about Keir Starmer and his proven track record of U-turning on multiple policy issues because he doesn’t have a plan.   Updated at 12.06pm GMT    9.23am GMT  Rachel Reeves defends Labour's green investment U-turn  Rachel Reeves has defended Labour’s U-turn on its pledge to spend £28bn a year on green projects. In a move that prompted an angry response from environmental groups, unions and some in the energy sector yesterday, Keir Starmer and Reeves jointly announced they would slash the green prosperity plan to under £15bn – only a third of which would be new money. The shadow chancellor blamed the Tories and the economic impact of Liz Truss’s mini-budget, as she told BBC Breakfast she would not “make any apologies” for fiscal responsibility.  I’ll make no apologies for ensuring that our plan is fully costed, fully funded and deliverable within the inheritance we’re going to get. It is going to be a bleak inheritance after the damage the Conservatives have done to our economy.  She said:  In the almost three years that I’ve been shadow chancellor, I think people have heard loud and clear from me that fiscal responsibility, economic responsibility, are the most important things for me because it is absolutely essential that the public finances are managed well. And when economic circumstances change, your plans have to change as well.

        "content": "The Green party incorrectly removed a spokesperson over his views on transgender rights, a court has ruled, while saying the wrongdoing was largely procedural and that parties are allowed to sack people because their views contravene policy. Shahrar Ali, a former deputy leader of the Greens in England and Wales, began legal action last year after the party had sacked him as the spokesperson for policing and domestic safety in February 2022. Ali’s views on transgender issues – he has described the biology of sex as “real and immutable” – are contrary to the party’s official stance and have been at the centre of previous internal rows over the issue. In 2021, Siân Berry quit as the party’s co-leader over what she said was the tension between her support for transgender rights and “the message sent by the party’s choice of frontbench representatives”, understood to be a reference to Ali’s position.   Related: ‘A politically toxic issue’: the legal battles over gender-critical beliefs   In a ruling released on Friday, the mayor’s and City county court in London said that Ali’s removal had been procedurally unfair, and it could not be ruled out that this was due to Ali’s beliefs on transgender issues. He was awarded £9,100 for injury to feelings. Ali said outside the court that this was “a landmark case”, likening it to other recent cases where people with so-called gender critical views were found to have been wrongly discriminated against. However, the ruling itself was more caveated. While Judge Stephen Hellman found for Ali on one count, he rejected other complaints. He also set out that, while the way Ali had been dismissed was unfair and could have been based on his views, more generally, political parties are able to remove spokespeople for advocating non-party views as long as they do so fairly. Ali took a different view, saying: “This is about women’s and children’s rights, and our right, within politics, to be able to articulate, ventilate and foster genuine debate on matters of great consequence without fear of disproportionate consequence.”   Related: The law is now clear: you can’t be sacked for having gender-critical views. So why does it keep happening? | Susanna Rustin   Jon Nott, the chair of the Greens’ executive, said: “We are pleased that the court has recognised that a democratic political party has the right to select those who speak for it on the basis that they can and will communicate and support party policy publicly. “We welcome the findings in the judgment that members of political parties have ‘fundamental party rights’ which include the right to disagree, to advocate for and against policies and positions adopted or proposed in the party, and to organise for those who agree with them and against those who do not, and that the Equality Act is not intended to interfere with those rights. “The party acknowledges that there were procedural shortfalls in how we deselected one of our spokespeople. We apologise for failing in this instance to live up to the standards that both we and the court expect.” Ali has long campaigned on transgender issues in the Green party. While he has some support, he has also been criticised. After serving as deputy leader from 2014 to 2016, he has stood to be the party’s leader three times, in 2018, 2020 and 2021, coming second in 2018 and third on the other occasions. • This article was amended on 12 February 2024. An earlier version said Shahrar Ali came last in the election for Green party leader on two occasions; in fact he was third out of three candidates in 2020, but third out of five in 2021. The headline, subheading and introduction were amended on 27 February 2024 to clarify it was his claim that was upheld in part, not that he was sacked “in part over transgender views”."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-09T14:50:43+00:00",
        "content": "Labour has spent the past few weeks performing a series of U-turns on previously announced policies as it finalises its manifesto, culminating in Thursday’s announcement of a huge cut to its green spending plans. Beyond the cuts to the £28bn annual spending pledge, party insiders have also let it be known they no longer intend to abolish the House of Lords, might reduce their planned tax on private equity profits and will not legislate to create a national care service. All this is part of Starmer’s plans to create a “bombproof” manifesto, which he set out at the end of last year and is intended to ensure the party is ready in case the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, calls an election in May. That process reached its first major deadline on Thursday, but is likely to dominate much of the leadership’s thinking for several months to come. “Part of the timing around today … is that all the shadow cabinet had to have their final proposals in today, fully funded, so that we can start putting them together for a manifesto,” Starmer told reporters on Thursday as he laid out the reasons for dropping the £28bn-a-year green plans. A shadow minister added: “The [£28bn] green prosperity plan looked like a massive slush fund so it didn’t survive bomb-proofing.” Starmer and his advisers have a sense of the main elements of the manifesto. The remaining green pledges, including a publicly owned energy supplier and a green sovereign wealth fund, remain. So does a set of proposals to strengthen trade union rights and employment protections known as the “new deal for working people” – despite pressure from corporate lobbyists to drop it. Other proposals will include a promise to use money from taxing non-doms to set up free breakfast clubs in every primary school and to pay for more doctors’ appointments at weekends and evenings. “Most of us got our policy proposals in a long time ago,” said one shadow cabinet minister. “Anyone who is still trying to work out what they want to do at this stage has just not done their homework.” Another added: “For most of us, this process has been stress free, but for some it has forced them to answer questions they have not properly resolved until now.” Important policy questions remain. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, has promised to end the current free hours system of funding childcare and replace it with something else entirely. But a review she has commissioned into what the new system should look like will not report until later this year. Phillipson has also promised to reform university tuition fees to help bring graduates’ monthly repayments down, but has still not said how this would happen. Labour officials will now spend the next few weeks scrutinising the policy proposals in detail to work out if they can be achieved and afforded. Ravinder Athwal, the policy chief in charge of writing the manifesto, has been told to have a final text ready by mid- to late-March. Unlike in previous elections, the party will not produce separate manifestos for different policy areas. One senior official said it would be a “lean, muscular document with a narrative running through it, rather than just a long list of policies”. Alongside the manifesto, Labour also plans to publish a costings document setting out how its policies will be funded. The same official said it would be “almost of equal importance to the manifesto itself – we will make a real virtue of that”. When an election is finally called, the party will hold a “clause V meeting” with party officials and trade union leaders to formally approve the manifesto, and only then will the public get to see it. Meanwhile, work will continue on finalising the text. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, has been “red-teaming” the proposals, looking for ideas that might fall apart in the intense scrutiny of a general election campaign. Once that has been done, Lucy Powell, the shadow Commons leader, will lead a separate process to check the policy proposals can actually be turned into legislation. Shadow cabinet ministers will be called into meetings with Powell and a team of others including Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, to thrash through how their policies would work in law.   Related: Labour’s mixed messages on £28bn green pledge put it in worst of all worlds   Those meetings will happen later in the year and possibly into government, party officials say, and are likely to prove one of Gray’s most important contributions to the party’s policy platform. For now, by junking the £28bn-a-year green spending plan, Starmer has given his party two important signals: first, that he is not willing to let anything undermine Labour’s claim to fiscal responsibility, and second, that he will not tolerate the manifesto being delayed. “I don’t want to hold it up because whatever has been said about when it might be, whatever Sunak needs to do for an early election, he has done,” he said. “I can’t afford to let my deadline slip.” • This article was amended on 9 February 2024. An earlier version said that Labour’s manifesto would “include a promise to set up free breakfast clubs in every primary school in England and to use money from taxing non-doms to train more nurses and midwives”. The money from non-doms would be used to fund a range of initiatives, including extra dental appointments and the aforementioned breakfast clubs, but not to train more nurses and midwives; that was a feature from a previous proposal.

        "content": "Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, has spoken of receiving death threats after the former Tory MP Nadine Dorries claimed she was aligned to a plot to control the top of the Conservative party. Badenoch said death threats had intensified since the publication of Dorries’ book The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson, which claims a sinister cabal called “the movement” has “set out to control the destiny of the Conservative party” for 25 years. In an interview with the Times, Badenoch said: “She [Dorries] thinks she’s just writing stuff, but people who have that kind of mindset latch on to it. “If you get the unhelpful coalition of mental health issues and propensity to violence, then you read the Nadine Dorries conspiracy theory and decide you want to kill someone, it’s very, very nasty.” Badenoch is a political ally of Michael Gove, who is portrayed by Dorries as being part of the plot along with a Conservative aide, Dougie Smith, and the former adviser to Johnson, Dominic Cummings.   Related: Nadine Dorries on cabals, cosmetic work and Cameron’s peerage: ‘If you’re an Etonian, someone just has a word with the king’   However, the business secretary suggested in the interview that her friendship with Gove had suffered recently. “He did something that was very, very annoying,” she said. Asked whether it had ended their friendship, she said: “It’s not what it used to be, but he’s somebody I have to work with.” The business secretary also complained that she was portrayed by Dorries as a puppet of Gove “as if I have no thoughts and no opinions of my own”, adding: “Like they’re saying: ‘She’s not that bright. It’s some man who is doing this.’” In relation to the idea that she was manipulated by powerful men, Badenoch said her husband, Hamish, was more of an influence. “If there’s somebody who is doing that, wouldn’t it be the person who goes to bed with me every night and pays for my home and so on? Hamish is a huge influence on how I do things. Which I think is right, because this job affects his life.” Dorries later tweeted to say Badenoch was “obsessing” over her book and had wrongly characterised an exchange between them, after the business secretary claimed she was approached by Dorries to be London mayor instead of running for leader. The former Tory MP said she had texted Badenoch after she was knocked out of the leadership race to pass on a message about the mayoralty from a donor. She added: “In The Plot, the assertion is made that Rishi was only ever a stopgap. That Kemi was the project. Kemi didn’t need the help. “She knew, whoever won, Rishi or Liz, they were just the caretaker until her closest friend, Dougie Smith and mentor and the rest of the plotters were ready to pop her into place. And, that is exactly what is happening before your very eyes right now and you heard it first in The Plot.” Dorries’ book has been serialised in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. She is a staunch ally of Johnson, and the book claims the cabal ousted him from No 10 and also “brought down Iain Duncan Smith as party leader, created havoc for Theresa May and undermined Liz Truss”. According to excerpts in the paper, Dorries wrote that after Johnson made Cummings his chief of staff, the “movement” instigated its plan to replace the prime minister after his December 2019 election victory as he had already served his purpose by winning an 80-seat majority."

Hunt made the comments in front of hundreds of City bosses, who were gathered in the Raffles hotel in Westminster for an annual dinner hosted by the financial services lobby group TheCityUK. When asked whether he would consider a British Isa, he said: “So there’s a certain category of questions that I’m not really able to answer … Those are things that might appear in the budget. And that is one of them.” “Do I want to do things that mean that more UK capital is invested in our most promising companies? Absolutely. I think that something like a British Isa could be very good at that.” It comes as the City faces growing threats from rival financial hubs including New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, particularly post-Brexit. London’s stock market has experienced an exodus of companies chasing capital outside the UK, with Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power, Betfair and FanDuel, saying last week that it was considering moving its primary listing to New York “as soon as practicable”. However, Hunt stopped short of suggesting he was ready to slash the 0.5% stamp duty levied on direct share purchases, which some City campaigners have claimed is a larger roadblock for local investors. Both proposals – the British stock Isa and the scrapping of stock stamp duty – have been lobbied for by City groups, including the industry body UK Finance. UK Finance’s spring budget submission paper, released earlier this week, said: “While the reforms in autumn statement 2023 to evolve the Isa regime were welcome, officials need to work with providers to ensure these changes can be properly implemented. The government should explore introducing a ‘British Isa’ focused on UK domestic equities to offer an easily accessible, trusted vehicle to incentivise investment in UK equities for individuals.” Hunt also reiterated ambitions to make the UK the next Silicon Valley, unleashing growth akin to the big bang changes to City regulations that some credit with unleashing a boom in British financial services. That would extend to a boost in tech-focused stock market listings. “We want the London Stock Exchange to become Europe’s Nasdaq,” he said."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-08T19:40:11+00:00",
        "content": "When Rachel Reeves announced Labour’s £28bn climate plan in 2021, she was so confident it was the right thing to do that she issued a dire warning about what would happen if the scheme was held up or scaled back. “The greatest cost to our public finances, as well as to our planet, will be if we delay and let the costs mount up for future generations to pay,” she told a packed hall at the party conference in Brighton. On Thursday, Reeves stood alongside the party leader, Keir Starmer, in front of about 30 journalists in a draughty room in parliament and reversed all of that. The £28bn was gone, as was the reasoning behind it. “We want to bring jobs to Britain, to bring energy bills down, to boost our energy security, and also to decarbonise the economy,” Reeves told reporters. “If you don’t need to spend £28bn in doing that, that’s great.” The reversal of Labour’s central economic and environmental policy has come after weeks of agonised decision-making by Starmer and Reeves, in conjunction with Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary. Thursday’s confirmation that the policy would be cut back to half its original scale is a key moment in Starmer’s leadership and could redefine the election campaign. It also marks a shift in Reeves’s entire economic philosophy. No longer is the shadow chancellor arguing for public investment for its own sake as a way to stimulate the economy and galvanise private capital. Instead, she says she wants to achieve Labour’s green targets using as little public money as possible. The story of how that change came about in the course of just over two years is indicative of the broader shift in approach from Starmer and Reeves in that time, as they have enacted a series of U-turns in an attempt to shed the baggage they fear could weigh them down in an election contest. From determination to doubt Reeves’s initial announcement in 2021 was regarded in senior Labour circles as a triumph. The Brighton conference had been fractious until then. The party had been plagued by splits between Starmer and Miliband on the question of whether energy companies should be nationalised. Senior figures had been followed wherever they went by protesters calling for a “green new deal”. The party’s members had defied the leadership by voting for a motion calling for a “socialist green new deal”. Reeves’s announcement brought an end to all that, answering the criticisms that Labour did not have a green policy and that it did not have an economic strategy. “I am committing the next Labour government to an additional £28bn of capital investment in our country’s green transition for each and every year of this decade,” she told delegates. “I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain’s first green chancellor.” Labour stuck to the plan for many months. At the party conference a year later, Starmer announced that a significant chunk of the money would be spent on a new national energy company, to be known as Great British Energy. Other schemes included a new sovereign wealth fund to invest in green schemes and a £6bn-a-year home insulation scheme to improve the energy efficiency of 19m properties. Gradually however, senior Labour figures became nervous. After Liz Truss’s turbulent 45 days in power, Labour’s pitch to the electors was no longer to be the party of radical change, but instead to offer reassurance where the Conservatives offered turmoil. Truss’s economic plans, coupled with the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, sent interest rates on UK government debt spiking from just over 1% at the beginning of 2022 to 4.5% by the middle of 2023. Reeves was growing concerned about the economic consequences of the £28bn policy, especially after a crucial meeting she had in Washington DC in June 2023 with Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary. People briefed on that meeting have told the Guardian that Yellen warned Reeves against making the mistake the Biden administration had of announcing major new climate investments without first reforming planning laws so they could get built. Reeves came back from that trip determined to make a change. She wrote an article for the Times announcing the £28bn figure would not be hit until the second half of the parliament, and that it would only be hit if Labour could meet its promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output at the end of a five-year period. Given the forecasts at the time predicted the government could borrow only an additional £6bn a year and still have debt falling in that time period, Reeves’s announcement all but killed her original policy. Decision time And yet Labour politicians continued to use the £28bn figure, putting the party in the awkward position of defending a figure they had no intention of hitting and could not say how it would be spent. Shadow ministers and advisers began pitching their ideas for how to change the policy. Some wanted to junk it altogether. Others wanted to use the money to fund other investment schemes, such as new schools and roads. Some suggested putting all the existing spending commitments in a single bill and abandoning the rest. As those around Starmer argued over what should happen, the leader continued to defend it publicly. “‘It’s absolutely clear to me that the Tories are trying to weaponise this issue, the £28bn,” he said in January. “This is a fight I want to have … If they want that fight on borrow-to-invest, I’m absolutely up for that fight.” Privately however, Starmer was becoming convinced of the need to make a change. He, Reeves and Miliband began working intensively on a compromise which would protect existing schemes such as GB Energy and the sovereign wealth fund, but scale back the home insulation scheme and clarify that no further spending would be announced. Labour officials insisted on Thursday the three had developed the plan together, downplaying talk of a split at the top of the party. The final decision was reached jointly just days ago, they added. Some of Starmer’s advisers urged him to wait until after Jeremy Hunt’s budget to make the final decision, not least because the chancellor was promising more tax cuts which would further reduce the room to borrow. The Labour leader, however, had told shadow ministers to have their manifesto policies ready by Thursday in case of a May election, so he knew a decision would have to be taken by then. Besides, reports in the Guardian and elsewhere about the fate of the £28bn were making it increasingly hard to hold the line. “Today is the deadline for shadow cabinet teams to get their proposals in and fully funded so we can begin the next stage of the process of the manifesto,” he told reporters on Thursday. “We knew we would have to get to a decision on this around about now.” Political ramifications The eventual U-turn was met with anger among green campaigners and some MPs, including the former shadow energy secretary Barry Gardiner, who called it “economically illiterate, environmentally irresponsible and politically jejune”. And while the party has recommitted to parts of its investment schemes, important question remain. Can Labour really decarbonise Britain’s energy sector by 2030 with this level of spending? What does the reduction in the home insulation programme mean for the legal requirement to eradicate fuel poverty by 2030? Many in Labour expressed relief at the change, however. “At least we know what the policy is now,” said one shadow minister. “At least we have something to defend.” But if Labour believes it now has something to defend, the Tories insist they still have something to attack. Senior advisers to Rishi Sunak insisted on Thursday they intended to keep using the £28bn figure, arguing Labour would have to end up spending that much when they realised they might miss their green targets. “Nothing has changed,” said one. But in a sign of how Thursday’s announcement by Starmer has made life more difficult for his opponents, the Conservatives were simultaneously accusing him of enacting another “flip-flop”. “The problem is the Tories now have to decide,” said one Labour figure. “Is it that nothing has changed, or have we flip-flopped? They can’t get their attack right.”"

        "content": "Labour has ditched its pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, blaming the Conservatives for “crashing the economy”.\nThe policy, the main component of Labour’s green prosperity plan, has been at the centre of a public and private struggle since it was announced, with factions inside the party arguing against moves to water it down.\nThe plan has now been drastically scaled back to under £15bn a year, only a third of which – just over £4.7bn a year – would be new money. Below are some of the key moments leading up to this point.\n27 September 2021\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, pledges to become the UK’s first “green chancellor” and invest £28bn a year for the rest of the decade, in front of cheering Labour members at the party’s conference in Brighton.\n23 September 2022\nLiz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget leads to what is later estimated to be a £30bn fiscal black hole, setting the scene for a recalibration of Labour’s own spending plans and pledges.\n\n Related: The Guardian view on Labour’s green retreat: wrong, wrong, wrong | Editorial \n\n9 June 2023\nLabour scales back plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry. Citing the poor economic backdrop and interest rate rises since the Truss mini-budget, Reeves delays plans for a green prosperity fund to start in the first year of a Labour government.\nDecember\nDiscussions within Labour about scaling back the £28bn plans increase amid fears the Conservatives will use the policy as a central line of attack in the general election campaign.\nBut sources also express concern about how a Labour government would improve economic growth without the green plan, and whether it could leave Keir Starmer open to charges of “flip-flopping” by the Tories.\n31 January 2024\nA pushback against plans to water down the pledge gathers pace among leading economists and business experts. Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens and a figure advising Labour on transport and infrastructure, describes £28bn a year as an “absolute minimum”.\n1 February 2024\nThe Guardian reveals that the £28bn a year pledge is to be ditched. Asked 10 times on Sky News if she backed the target, Reeves refuses to use the number at all, saying instead: “The importance of economic and fiscal stability … will always come first.”\nJonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, says the figure remains an ambition but it is unclear “if we can get there”. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, all but confirms a day later that the commitment is going.\n6 February\nStarmer says in a Times Radio interview that the pledge to spend £28bn a year is “desperately needed”, as he reopens the issue and supporters view his comments as a recommitment. The Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant says a day later: “On the £28bn, we are not scaling back. We intend to deliver that.”\n7 February\n\n Related: Circumstances have changed, our ambitions have not. That’s what you need to know now about our green plan | Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves \n\nBryant, the shadow culture minister, says in a morning interview that Labour will spend £28bn. Hours later, after prime minister’s questions in parliament, a Labour spokesperson tells reporters the party is committed to “£28bn, subject to the fiscal rules and subject to what the government leave on the table”.\n8 February\nLabour confirms the party does not now believe it will be able to meet the commitment of £28bn a year in its green prosperity plan, blaming the Conservatives for “crashing” the economy, and what it described as the government’s plan to “max out the country’s credit card”.\nInstead, Labour “reconfirms” its commitment to policies under the plan to create jobs and cut bills.\nIt says the policies would represent £23.7bn of investment over the course of the next parliament, funded in large part by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, with the remainder coming through borrowing within its fiscal rules."

        "content": "Labour has cut its green investment plans by half, ending weeks of speculation and confirming the biggest and most controversial U-turn of Keir Starmer’s leadership.\nIn a move that prompted an angry response from environmental groups, unions and some in the energy sector, Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, jointly announced they would slash the green prosperity plan from £28bn a year to under £15bn – only a third of which would be new money.\nIt ended a protracted internal battle within Labour over the policy, with some senior officials urging Starmer to stick to his green commitments and others warning it would be an electoral liability.\nWhile intended to shield against repeated Conservative attacks on the scale of borrowing required, the climbdown infuriated environmental campaigners, who said it would push up costs in the long term and make it harder for Labour to reach ambitious green targets.\nThe Unite union said Labour risked “outsourcing their policymaking to the Conservatives”, while the energy industry’s trade group said it was concerned about the reduced ambition for “the future of our sector in the UK”.\nSpeaking to reporters in Westminster, Starmer said: “We will not reach the £28bn – the £28bn, therefore, is stood down and we focus on the outcomes. We want to get to that place because at the moment all you are ever asked about is the size of the cheque and we want to have an argument about the outcomes, which is what matters.”\nHe added: “We announced the £28bn two and a half years or so ago, when interest rates were very, very low. Since then, Liz Truss crashed the economy and other damage has been done. [Interest rates] are now very, very high – interest on government debt is already tens of billions of pounds a year.\n“We’ve always said we have to be within the fiscal rules and fiscal rules come first.”\nLabour announced the £28bn spending plan in 2021, as Reeves promised to be the UK’s “first green chancellor”. She said at the time the money would be spent on battery manufacturing, hydrogen power, offshore wind, tree planting, flood defences and home insulation.\n\n Related: How Labour ditched its flagship £28bn green investment pledge \n\nSince then the party has come under increasing attack over the plan, as Starmer and Reeves struggled to explain how they could stick to the spending commitment and keep a separate promise to cut government debt levels in the long term.\nThe Guardian revealed last week that Starmer had decided to scale back the plan after lengthy internal discussion and heavy lobbying from aides, such as Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s campaign chief, who said sticking to it would be an electoral liability.\nEd Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, had pushed back against diluting the plan. There was even speculation, denied by his team, that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming the U-turn.\nStarmer had continued to cite the £28bn target as recently as Tuesday, telling Times Radio it was “desperately needed” for the party’s mission of achieving clean power by 2030.\nOn Thursday, he told reporters he no longer believed this was needed. Instead, Labour would spend just over £4.7bn a year, on top of £10bn of green schemes it says the government has already committed to.\nAbout half of that money would come from changes to the government’s oil and gas windfall tax, with Labour planning to raise the rate from 75% to 78% and extend it until the end of the parliament. The other half would come from new borrowing.\nThe biggest cuts have been to the party’s home insulation scheme. Labour had previously promised to spend up to £6bn a year insulating 19m homes over a decade.\nUnder the revised plans Starmer and Reeves intend to spend just £6.6bn over the parliament – an average of £1.3bn a year.\nThe cuts will mean the party reducing its targets for the number of properties it can insulate. Starmer said Labour now intended to insulate 5m homes over the first five years of government, and that it would take as long as 14 years to reach the 19m target.\nOther schemes, including a £7.3bn national wealth fund and an £8.3bn national energy supplier called Great British Energy, will remain, in an effort to meet the clean power pledge.\nReeves said: “Something had to give if we were going to be within our fiscal rules and to achieve clean power by 2030. We have got to get on with the national wealth fund and GB Energy, and so we have scaled back our ambition on warm homes.”\nLabour’s U-turn dismayed many green campaigners, who said their energy targets would be difficult to hit without the promised level of spending.\nAreeba Hamid, the co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said Starmer had “caved like a house of cards in the wind”.\nMike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said Labour had “turned its back on the people who most urgently need these essential upgrades – the many millions of low-income households suffering from living in poorly insulated homes”.\nEmma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said the issue was less the actual sum spent than “the signal it sends”. She said: “The party has been engaging constructively with business over recent months, but retaining the confidence of the market is dependent on not making U-turns that damage the UK’s investability.”\nA number of Labour MPs simply expressed relief that the policy had been decided. One shadow cabinet minister said: “The policy is the main thing. To put a number on it was always a hostage to fortune with a flatlining economy and a government spending all that it has.”"

        "content": "Humza Yousaf has carried out a mini cabinet reshuffle after his beleaguered health secretary quit over a parliamentary investigation into how he racked up a near-£11,000 bill on his work iPad. The first minister attempted to refresh his government after enduring intense cross-party attacks at Holyrood over the resignation of Michael Matheson on Thursday. Matheson had previously refused repeated demands to stand down. Matheson, who resigned three hours before he was due to confirm the minimum unit price for alcoholic drinks in Scotland would rise by 30%, said he did not want to “become a distraction”. He is under investigation by Holyrood authorities after he admitted his sons had used his parliamentary iPad as a hotspot to watch football matches on their Christmas holiday in Morocco, running up a £10,935 data bill. Matheson’s resignation letter offered no apology or explanation for the timing of his decision but Yousaf’s official spokesperson said there was “clearly a very strong possibility” Matheson faces significant sanctions as a result of the investigation. “Obviously Michael believed [those were] compelling grounds to offer his resignation this morning,” he said. Holyrood authorities confirmed Matheson had not yet seen its draft conclusions, which were finalised by its corporate body on Wednesday. He will now be paid £12,712 in ministerial severance pay. Informed sources say the investigation, which is likely to be published in late February, has new evidence about his handling of the roaming bill. That raises the prospect Holyrood’s standards committee will recommend his suspension from parliament. Yousaf’s spokesperson appeared to confirm that was uppermost in Matheson’s resignation decision, and said the first minister and his aides had already been planning a reshuffle as a “contingency” exercise. Several hours later Yousaf appointed the highly regarded Neil Gray as the new health secretary, in his first reshuffle since taking office last March, with Màiri McAllan, another well-regarded younger minister, given Gray’s job of wellbeing economy secretary. Kaukab Stewart became the first woman of colour to be a Scottish minister, covering culture and international development. Rumours that Kate Forbes, Yousaf’s right-of-centre leadership rival, could be invited back into government proved unfounded. Matheson had initially claimed that the iPad bill was so large because he had not realised his sim card was out of date and no longer in contract, but insisted it was a legitimate parliamentary expense. Holyrood officials accepted his word, and agreed that £3,000 of that would be paid through his office expenses while the remainder would be funded by parliament. Matheson knew in February that £8,666 had been incurred on 2 January. In November he admitted that his wife had told him a week earlier that his sons had used his iPad as a hotspot to stream a match between bitter rivals Celtic and Rangers on that date. Yousaf, who spoke privately to Matheson on Thursday morning, said he accepted his resignation “with sadness” and that he had given the country “tremendous service”. The resignation comes a day after Elena Whitham, the drugs and alcohol policy minister, also stepped down after revealing she was suffering from post-traumatic stress. Matheson’s resignation dominated a rowdy first minister’s questions on Thursday after the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, attacked Yousaf for showing weakness by failing to sack Matheson for lying last year. Yousaf said it was “quite galling” for a Tory to lecture any other party on integrity and honesty, given repeated scandals over ministerial conduct at Westminster. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said: “This weak first minister can reshuffle the pack all he wants – the fact is that all the cards left are jokers. After 17 years it is clear that this tired SNP government is out of ideas and out of road.”"

They don’t need another leg-up from the Tories” (Tories fuelling ‘greed is good’ with lift of cap on bankers’ bonuses, says TUC, 31 October). Now Rachel Reeves promises similar support from Labour (Frustration in Labour ranks over Reeves’s refusal to reinstate bankers’ bonus cap, 1 February). How different from her response in the Commons when Kwasi Kwarteng announced his plan: “Of all the things that he could save from the wreckage of the kamikaze budget that he chooses to press ahead with, it is their plan to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses. At a time when he is urging wage constraints for everybody else, how can he remotely claim that that is fair?” Unless Labour is now urging wage increases for everyone else, it is very sad and damaging if the party commits to retaining one of the few legacies of Liz Truss’s premiership.Mike SheaffPlymouth • When Labour supporters go knocking on doors, I wonder how many report back and say: “You know what people are asking for? They are asking for there to be no cap on bankers’ bonuses.” My guess is none. So who was asking for this? This outrageous decision by the shadow chancellor fuels the belief of many who say they don’t know what Labour stands for, given that Labour has previously criticised the Tories for removing the cap, saying they were out of touch with the public. For me, this could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, and I may well resign from the Labour party.Barry NormanDrighlington, West Yorkshire • If this is a sign that Rachel Reeves wants to rebuild the economy based on being a leading financial services centre, someone needs to tell her that we’ve been there before and we don’t want to go back. On the other hand, the green investment plan that appears to be downgraded by her with each new mention is forward-looking and urgent, and continues to attract widespread support. She should be leading the economic challenges by inviting critics to answer the question: an economy built on dealing with money or one that sets out to build resilience in the face of accelerating climate change? It’s a no-brainer.Les BrightExeter  • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

He made the remark after he was told by Starmer that Brianna’s mother, Esther Ghey, was in the public gallery.\n\n Related: Whether driven by Sunak’s callousness or clumsiness, trans jibe is PM’s new normal \n\nBrianna’s father, Peter Spooner, said Sunak’s comment had been “dehumanising” and urged him to apologise. Brianna was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered by two teenagers in February last year.\nOn a visit to Cornwall, Sunak told reporters: “Like everyone, I was completely shocked by Brianna’s case. To have your child taken from you in such awful circumstances is almost impossible to come to terms with, and for Brianna’s mum to talk with such empathy and compassion about that, I thought, was inspiring and it showed the very best of humanity. I’ve nothing but the most heartfelt sympathy for her entire family and friends.”\n“But to use that tragedy to detract from the very separate and clear point I was making about Keir Starmer’s proven track record of multiple U-turns on major policies, because he doesn’t have a plan, I think is both sad and wrong, and it demonstrates the worst of politics.”\nThe prime minister’s remark drew fierce criticism from opposition parties and some Conservatives. Starmer told Sunak: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAsked to respond to Spooner’s request for an apology, Sunak said his comments had been “absolutely legitimate”. “If you look at what I said, I was very clear, talking about Keir Starmer’s proven track record of U-turns on major policies because he doesn’t have a plan.”\nEarlier on Thursday, the policing minister, Chris Philp, said Sunak was “very keen” to meet Brianna’s family.\nEsther Ghey wrote on Peace & Mind UK, the Facebook page she set up for a campaign in her daughter’s memory, that she did not “wish to comment on reports of wording or comments recently made. My focus is on creating a positive change and a lasting legacy for Brianna.\n“Through Peace & Mind, we want to improve lives by empowering people, giving them the tools they need to build mental resilience, empathy and self-compassion through mindfulness. In developing these skills, I hope that we can create a more understanding, peaceful and stronger society for everyone.”\nSeveral Tory MPs have criticised Sunak’s remark. The former minister Paul Scully told the BBC’s Politics Live: “If it was me, I would probably pick up the phone to Brianna’s father, frankly.” Another former minister, Jackie Doyle-Price, told Times Radio that while she advocated balancing transgender rights with the protection of single-sex spaces, Sunak’s comment “trivialises something that’s very important” and was “frankly very ill-judged”.\nDehenna Davison, another former minister, said on X that it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense”, adding: “Our words in the house resonate right across our society and we all need to remember that.”\nBrianna’s mother had been in Westminster during PMQs with her local MP, Charlotte Nichols, as she campaigned for mindfulness lessons to be taught in schools after her daughter’s murder.\nBrianna was stabbed to death by Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe in a Cheshire park last year. During their sentencing last week, the judge said the “exceptionally brutal” murder had elements of sadism on the part of Jenkinson and transphobic hate on the part of Ratcliffe."

        "content": "The home secretary, James Cleverly, has apologised and arranged for compensation to be paid to a human rights activist after officials unlawfully detained him at Gatwick airport on his return to the UK from a UN meeting in Switzerland. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, a prominent Bahraini human rights activist and advocacy director of the London-based NGO Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, is a torture survivor who was granted asylum in the UK in 2012 after he fled persecution at the hands of Bahraini authorities. Alwadaei was stopped by UK Border Force officials on 29 September last year after returning from Geneva, where he had addressed the UN human rights council about abuses experienced by political prisoners in Bahrain. He was detained for two and a half hours at Gatwick and said he was not provided with a sufficient explanation for why he was stopped. His lawyers started a legal challenge against the home secretary for unlawful detention at the airport that the government settled with a compensation payout of hundreds of pounds and an apology in writing from Cleverly. A letter from government lawyers in response to the legal claim states: “Following your client’s complaint, the SSHD [secretary of state for the home department] has reviewed his records and accepts that your client was unlawfully detained. The SSHD apologises to your client for the actions of his officials and offers … compensation for the distress caused. “Your client’s immigration records have been checked and the records updated to make sure this does not happen in the future. The secretary of state is unable to discern what powers were purported to be exercised.” The government letter was written in response to the legal challenge and addressed to Alwadaei’s lawyer, Ben Keith of 5SAH, who filed a pre-action protocol letter to challenge Gatwick detention. Keith argued that Border Force officials were unlawfully exercising powers to stop, detain and arrest an individual without suspicion under immigration rules. He asked the Home Office to update Alwadaei’s record in a way that removed any possible flag that would trigger future automatic checks at the border. The government letter states: “The secretary of state for the home department of course is unable to provide any assurance that your client will never be stopped and questioned by Border Force officers in the normal course of their duties, as it would be inappropriate for him to do so.” Alwadaei said: “Exposing human rights violations of the Bahraini regime has often come at a personal cost and reprisals against me and my family back in Bahrain. To be detained upon my return to the UK was very distressing and came soon after the Bahraini regime pledged to invest £1bn into the UK economy and was rewarded by the UK government removing it from its human rights priority list.” He said he has been stopped at least eight times at UK airports. “The UK government must abide by its laws, ensuring that nobody is unjustly detained, particularly those advocating for human rights.” Keith said: “It is concerning that my client has been detained unlawfully. No reasons have been put forward by the Home Office. So we are left to speculate as to whether he was stopped because of an unpublished watch list, an Interpol notice or simple incompetence.” Last year, some MPs raised concerns after Bahrain was dropped from the Foreign Office list of “human rights priority countries” just days after the kingdom’s pledge to invest £1bn in Britain. In May 2023 a secret Home Office policy to detain people at airports who have the right to live in the UK and who have NHS debts was found to be unlawful. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Border Force’s number one priority is to keep our borders safe and secure, and we will never compromise on this. Officers may stop any arriving passenger for the purposes of further examination where they are not immediately satisfied that they qualify for entry.”"

        "content": "  5.45pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Labour has cut its green investment plans by half, as Keir Starmer ended weeks of speculation to confirm the biggest U-turn of his leadership in a move designed to bolster the party’s chances at the general election. Here is an analysis from Fiona Harvey as to what this means.    Related: ‘A make-or-break moment’: what does Labour’s U-turn mean for the UK’s green transition?   And here is an extract:  Estimates from thinktanks and academics suggest 10s of billions a year are needed for the shift to a low-carbon future: the IPPR thinktank came up with a figure of £30bn a year of public investment in a study in 2021, while earlier this year the London School of Economics suggested £26bn a year. And as a result, the UK is now lagging behind. As Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the E3G thinktank, put it: “A lack of investment in our clean energy transition has left the UK off track to meet our climate targets and uncompetitive in the global clean tech race. Securing climate safety and future prosperity requires a major uplift in public green investment.”   Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise to Brianna Ghey’s father and said it was “sad and wrong” to link his jibe about transgender people to the murdered teenager’s case.      5.41pm GMT   These are from Faisal Islam, the BBC’s economics editor, on what Labour is doing.  Bottom line:Opposition prioritising ability to attack Government over the rise in mortgage rates as their central election strategy, versus defending an economic strategy of borrowing to invest in a green Industrial Revolution, in a US/ Biden way…— Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) February 8, 2024   Bottom line:Opposition prioritising ability to attack Government over the rise in mortgage rates as their central election strategy, versus defending an economic strategy of borrowing to invest in a green Industrial Revolution, in a US/ Biden way…   Essentially the strategy here is  Relentlessly saying “Tory Mortgage Premium” is being prioritised over defending “£28bn green borrowing”   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    5.36pm GMT   This is from Common Wealth, a leftwing thinktank, on Labour’s £28bn U-turn. Its director Mathew Lawrence said:  Labour’s retreat from their green investment plan – on the same day scientists have confirmed last year was a record for global heating – is a deeply disappointing reversal. Our homes will be colder, our energy dirtier, our economy weaker, the transition slower and more expensive as a result. What’s more, the shrinking of ambition is taking place exactly as other countries are pouring record levels of investment into the green industries and jobs of the future. Despite the U-turn, the outlines of an agenda – GB Energy, clean power by 2030, and green wealth fund – remain. However, if these ideas are to be more than rhetoric, Labour needs a strong commitment to what remains of their plans to delivering serious public investment and deep and meaningful change.   Updated at 5.41pm GMT    5.29pm GMT  Labour gives details of what's in green prosperity plan  As well as dropping the £28bn annual target, Labour has also released some details of what is still in the green prosperity plan. Journalists have been given a briefing paper which does not seem to be online yet. A lot of this has been announced before, but some elements are new – in particular relating to the insulation plan, where Labour says there will be “a slower initial roll out than we had hoped to deliver”. Here are the details. This is a relatively long post, but since there is a lot of comment around these days about Labour not having a plan, given that they have published it, it seems worth showing what it actually says. Setting up Great British Energy, costing £8.3bn Labour says:  We will create a new publicly owned company – Great British Energy - to invest in homegrown clean energy across the country and give us real energy independence from foreign dictators.   GB Energy will be headquartered in Scotland. It will accelerate new nuclear and position Britain as a leader in technologies such as floating offshore wind and tidal. It will also partner with the private sector to accelerate the rollout of more mature renewable energy generation technologies such as wind and solar.   We already have public ownership of energy in Britain, just by foreign governments such as the French and Chinese, rather than our own. Great British Energy will aim to emulate the success of domestic energy champions in other European countries.   A Labour Government will capitalise Great British Energy with an initial £8.3bn (inclusive of the £3.3bn Local Power Plan) – over the first parliament, investing in partnership with the private sector.  Having a local power plan, using £3.3bn of the 38.3bn for GB Energy Labour says:  Whilst the Conservatives block cheap homegrown renewables with an onshore wind ban that is costing families £180 on their bills every year, Labour will back the builders and not the blockers, so that communities in all four nations of the UK can put up wind turbines, solar panels, and other forms of low carbon power to cut bills.   To drive the energy transition and crowd in investment, as part of its initial capitalisation, Great British Energy, Labour’s publicly owned energy company, will partner with energy companies, local authorities and cooperatives to develop 8GWs of clean power by 2030 - double the power of the world’s largest windfarm.   That is why Labour is allocating resources to support local power in partnership with communities. Of Great British Energy’s capitalisation, £3.3bn will be available in grants for local authorities and loans to communities to create one million owners of local power.  Setting up a national wealth fund, valued at £7.3bn Labour says:  Labour will set up a National Wealth Fund, which will create good well paying jobs in a zero-carbon economy by investing in industries where one pound of public investment can crowd-in a further three pounds of private sector investment.   This plan will help to re-industrialise the UK with hundreds of thousands of good jobs for plumbers, electricians, engineers, and technicians across the country.   A Labour Government will invest £7.3bn in our National Wealth Fund, with investment deployed in every region and nation of the UK, including:  • Steel: investing £2.5bn in a bright future for our steel industry, benefiting communities in Cardiff, Rotherham, Sheffield, Port Talbot and Scunthorpe. This reflects our original £3bn commitment, of which £500m is now in the government’s spending plans. Due to the perilous state of the steel industry, we are accelerating this scheme from over ten years to five.  • Ports: upgrading our ports so they are renewable-ready, with an investment of £1.8bn, which would inject investment into nine clusters, including; Forth and Tay, Humber, East Anglia, Solent, North West and North Wales, Belfast Harbour, North East Scotland, North East England and the Celtic Sea.  • Gigafactories: breaking the ground for new electric vehicle and battery factories, with £1.5bn investment in our automotive heartlands in the West Midlands, the North East, and the South West. This is in addition to the £500m already committed by the UK Government.  • Industrial hubs: decarbonising carbon-intensive heavy industrial hubs in every corner of the country, with an investment of £1bn, benefiting Scotland, South Wales, the Humber, Teesside and Merseyside.  • Hydrogen: channelling up to £500m into green hydrogen manufacturing, which could benefit the North West, Sheffield and the South East.   Taken together, these policies will support the creation of over 200,000 direct jobs and up to 260,000-300,000 indirect jobs over the decade. This will directly address geographical inequalities, with 50,000 new jobs each in both the North West and Yorkshire, as well as 30,000 new jobs each in the North East, the East Midlands, the West Midlands, and the East of England.   The National Wealth Fund will use a range of tools of support, including equity stakes in return for those investments.  British jobs bonus, costed at £500m a year  We will boost investment and jobs in Britain’s industrial heartlands and coastal communities, by rewarding clean energy developers with a British Jobs Bonus if they invest in good jobs and supply chains in those areas.   Labour will allocate a fund of up to £500m per year, starting from the 2026-27 contract for difference auction round, to provide capital grants to incentivise companies developing clean technologies like offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage, to target their investment particularly at the regions that most need it.  Warm homes plan, with £6.6bn on top of the £6.6bn already being spent by the Tories  The national emergency of rising energy bills has again highlighted the urgent importance of insulating as many homes as possible. The UK spends more money on energy wasted through the walls and roofs of our houses than any other country in Western Europe.   Labour’s Warm Homes Plan would start a national programme that will upgrade up to five million of the UK’s 16 million homes below an EPC rating of C over the parliament. Our aim will remain to ensure that every home below EPC C that can be practically upgraded, is done by 2035 - this is aligned with the government’s target, but offers a credible plan.   This programme will go street by street, installing energy saving measures such as loft insulation and low-carbon heating, saving families on low-incomes hundreds of pounds per year, slashing fuel poverty, and getting Britain back on track to meeting our climate targets.   Our investment will be split between: energy efficiency grants, delivered hand-in-glove with local authorities to target the areas and families in most need; government-backed zero-interest loans for green home upgrades like solar panels; and grants to make sure heat pumps are affordable for people who want them. We will work with commercial banks to ensure they offer mortgage products that support retrofit. This is a slower initial roll out than we had hoped to deliver when we originally planned this policy, due to the fiscal situation. On the Tories’ watch, insulation rates have crashed 90% - one of the reasons the UK had one of the most acute energy price crises in Western Europe.  Proper windfall tax on oil and gas companies  Labour will introduce a proper windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies, so we can invest in the clean power we need to cut bills for families.  Labour will fix the holes in the Energy Profits Levy by:  • Increasing the rate to 78%, the same rate of tax as in Norway.  • Ending the loopholes in the levy that funnel billions back to oil and gas giants.  • Extend the sunset clause in the windfall tax until the end of the next parliament, provided there continue to be windfall profits.   Together, these changes would raise £10.8bn over the next five years from 2024-25 to help fund the Green Prosperity Plan.   This amount is based on current OBR forecasts. The amount raised will depend on outturn oil and gas prices and production levels, as well as the level of investment and the amount offset against taxation.   Updated at 5.29pm GMT    5.12pm GMT  Labour has 'world-leading agenda on climate and energy', says Ed Miliband, after £28bn target dropped  Labour’s news release confirming the abandonment of the £28bn annual green investment target contains these quotes from Labour figures. From Keir Starmer  I have changed the Labour party to put it back in the service of working people. Our Green Prosperity Plan is about turning a corner on fourteen years of Conservative decline and investing in Britain’s future. It is a plan for more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills. It’s a plan to get our country’s future back.  From Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, said:  Labour is ambitious for Britain’s future. There is a global race taking place in the jobs and industries of the future, and we are determined to lead it. All the Conservatives are offering the country is five more years of economic failure that will working people choice. Labour has a plan to invest and to get Britain’s future back.  And from Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said:  Labour will be fighting the election with a world-leading agenda on climate and energy with every single individual policy already announced now confirmed for the manifesto: Great British Energy, a National Wealth Fund, a Warm Homes Plan, a British Jobs Bonus, a Local Power Plan and no new oil and gas licences as well as our 2030 clean power mission.  It is thought that, of these three, Miliband will have been the one most reluctant to see the £28bn target go, because of his particularly strong personal commitment to the net zero agenda. He has not been doing interviews recently, and the Conservatives have been running a social media campaign suggesting he’s in hiding.  Updated at 5.24pm GMT    5.03pm GMT  Labour says it won't be able to spend £28bn per year on green investment because Tories crashed the economy  Labour has confirmed that it has formally dropped its target of spending £28bn a year on green investment. It made the announcement in a briefing to journalists giving new details of its green prosperity plan. The party said:  Labour has today announced plans to invest in Britain’s future, with Keir Starmer setting out further details of Labour’s mission to kick start growth and deliver clean power by 2030. As part of the party’s finalisation of policies for a general election campaign, Labour has reconfirmed its commitment to the policies announced through the Green Prosperity Plan, to create jobs, cut bills and unlock investment. The Green Prosperity Plan will be funded by a windfall tax on the oil and gas giants, and borrowing to invest within Labour’s fiscal rules. The party also confirmed that, due to the Conservatives’ crashing the economy and Jeremy Hunt’s plans to ‘max out’ the country’s credit card, it would not be possible to reach the previous commitment of £28bn a year. The centrepiece of the package is Great British Energy, a publicly owned energy company to take back control of the energy system on behalf of the British people.   Updated at 5.25pm GMT    4.55pm GMT  Gordon Brown defends dropping £28bn green investment target, saying Labour has to show 'fiscal discipline'  Gordon Brown has also defended Labour’s decision to drop £28bn as the annual target for spending on green investment. Asked about the move being confirmed today, Brown told LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr:  I haven’t seen any official announcement actually. But if that’s what he’s decided, it is because [Keir Starmer] and [Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor] have decided that they’ve got to abide by some fiscal discipline, given the state of the public finances.  You have got to remember when we left power in 2010, debt was below 40% of national income. It’s now 100% of our national income, I got criticised for allowing it to rise to 40%. Now it’s 100% and the Conservatives have got to take some responsibility for leaving a mess for the incoming government, whoever it is.      4.50pm GMT   Rishi Sunak deliberately visited a dental practice that’s not accepting new adult NHS patients, Downing Street have said. (See 3.21pm and 3.26pm.) The prime minister went to Gentle Dental in Newquay to promote his plans to offer cash incentives to dentists to accept more patients as more than 12 million were unable to get an appointment last year. Sunak insisted the announcements this week will make a significant difference, and quickly”. When asked if Sunak couldn’t find a practice accepting new patients, the prime minister’s deputy spokesperson said:   The prime minister wants to hear about the challenges surgeries are facing, and the challenges we’re trying to address through our dental plan … It’s right for the prime minister to hear from people on the frontline.      4.39pm GMT   The Labour announcement about the future of the commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment is coming at 5pm.     4.34pm GMT   Rishi Sunak was in Cornwall today where he visited an dental surgery that does not accept adult NHS dental patients. (See 3.26pm.) He also visited Nancledra preschool where one of the people on the advisory board is Hannah Ray, a former colleague at the Guardian. I know that readers often wonder what the point of these visits is. Hannah was there, and she has been wondering about it too. She sent me this.  Rishi Sunak visited our preschool today, and completely missed the point. He did a puzzle with one of the children, looked at the guinea pigs, looked at the garden, and then took questions from the local press. But while the press asked about second homes, his response to Brianna Ghey comments made at PMQs, and local council funding, no one – including the PM – seemed at all interested that the very preschool he was sitting in is under constant threat of closure due to lack of government funding into early years provision and lack of investment in early years staff training and incentives. Government funding is now available for nearly all two-year-olds. However, the living wage has gone up by 9.8%. Staff are barely paid above the minimum wage yet have the biggest responsibility, working long hard hours to care for the most vulnerable people in society. The preschool is bursting at the seams with working parents wanting to get the childcare they need, but there aren’t the spaces. Why did Rishi visit our preschool, in one of the most under-funded areas of the country, and one of the most deprived, if he didn’t really care about how it was doing?   Updated at 4.44pm GMT    4.21pm GMT  Gordon Brown says he apologised as PM when he made mistakes, and Sunak should too  The former prime minister Gordon Brown has added his voice to those saying Rishi Sunak should apologise for his anti-trans jibe at PMQs yesterday. Asked about it in an interview for Sky’s Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge, Brown said:  Well, when I made mistakes, I did apologise. And look, every prime minister makes mistakes. I don’t think you can say that every prime minister will fail to make some mistakes, but I think you should apologise if you get things wrong and I mean it is a very sad and really tragic, tragic case of a family in grief.  I know he’s said he’s compassionate about the family, but perhaps he should do what I had to do on one or two occasions and apologise. And I do accept that if you make mistakes, you’ve got to correct them quickly.  Brown was giving an interview to highlight his concern about rising levels of extreme poverty in Britain, and his proposals for what should be done to address this. He has written about this in an article for the Guardian.   Related: Homes without heating, tables without food.

Helena found out about this using a freedom of information request. But this came as a surprise to the Liberal Democrats, because the party had also submitted FoI requests to try to find out what hospitality the Environment Agency boss has been receiving and this dinner was not disclosed. The Lib Dem MP Tim Farron suspects some sort of cover up, and he has written to Sir Laurie Magnus, the PM’s ethics adviser, to ask if the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for the Environment Agency, is in breach of the ministerial code. He has posted the letter on X.  Enough is enough. This is starting to stink of a cover up. I’ve called for an investigation into a possible breach of Ministerial code.

Scotland’s finance secretary, Robison also confirmed that ministers are considering demands for a new public health levy to claw-back the excess profits that shops earn from MUP, although she said the government already spends £112m a year on alcohol and drug treatment units.The Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde university estimates retailers have earned around £30m a year in unearned profits from MUP because they keep the difference between the higher price paid for drinks and the wholesale price of the product.Scottish Labour and public health charities argue the case for a claw-back is now even greater; a higher 65p minimum price means higher unearned profits. Labour said the levy’s on proceeds should be spent on alcohol treatment and recovery projects.Robison said they were consulting businesses and health experts on doing so, with a decision due before the next Scottish budget later this year. Scotland had a public health levy on large retailers between 2012 and 2015, which raised £95m.The Scottish Retail Consortium said it welcomed the increased unit price but was furious at the prospect of an “unevidenced and unreasonable” new levy. “Any mooted tax rises are nothing more than a thinly veiled cash grab at the expense of an industry already under immense pressure,” it said.     3.37pm GMT   Liz Truss is going to publish her book, Ten Years to Save the West – Lessons from the only conservative in the room, on 16 April, the publishers, Biteback, have announced. In a news release about it, they say:  In Ten Years to Save the West, former prime minister Liz Truss reflects on the battles she fought – and too often lost – against the establishment during her ten years in government and sets out what conservatives and their allies across the western world must do in the years ahead if hostile regimes and increasingly extreme left-wing ideologies are to be defeated …  Ten Years to Save the West offers a timely warning about the perils facing conservatism in the years ahead if the agenda continues to be set in so many institutions – from the media to academia and the corporate world – by those espousing extreme ideologies, from the net zero zealots to the radical trans activists questioning basic scientific facts. If the west is to preserve the economic and cultural freedom and institutions that it holds so dear, Truss’s warnings need to be heeded.  Truss has secured a plug for her book from Boris Johnson, her predecessor, who says:  Liz Truss is right about one big thing – the old establishment economic models are failing. That’s bad news for the entire western world. And she is right that the last thing any of us now needs is more socialism, more taxes and more regulation. We need to reject that tiresome refrain of the global left and instead pursue an agenda that unleashes enterprise and boosts economic growth. I commend this invigorating tract!      3.26pm GMT   The British Dental Association says that, in visiting a dental practice that is not taking new adult NHS patients (see 3.21pm), Rishi Sunak was seeing what the reality is for millions of people. The BDA’s chair Eddie Crouch said:  Rishi Sunak is seeing what life is like for millions across this country. The difference is he has options The PM won’t have to queue around the block to get an appointment. He won’t face travelling hundreds of miles for care. He’ll never find himself reaching for a set of pliers. The paucity of the government’s plan means many patients will keep facing these horrific choices.  The BDA has been fiercely critical of the government’s dental recovery plan published yesterday, saying it is “incapable of even beginning to honour Sunak’s promise to ‘restore’ NHS dentistry, or in any way meet the government’s stated ambition to provide access to NHS dentistry for ‘all who need it’”.     3.21pm GMT   The dental practice Rishi Sunak visited in Cornwall today to promote his government’s dentistry plan is not accepting new adult NHS patients, PA Media reports. PA says:  The prime minister met staff and patients at Gentle Dental in Newquay on Thursday. He told broadcasters that “it hasn’t been easy enough for people to access NHS dentistry over the past couple of years” but claimed “the announcements this week will make a significant difference, and quickly”. “It’s a very significant new investment in dentistry so that everyone can get the access that they need,” Sunak said. But the practice’s website states that it is not taking on new adult NHS patients or those entitled to free dental care.      3.17pm GMT   Esther Ghey, whose daughter Brianna was murdered and who was in parliament yesterday when Rishi Sunak made an anti-trans jibe at PMQs, has said she does not want to comment on the row. In a post on Facebook page of the Peace & Mind UK campaign she set up in her daughter’s memory, she wrote:   I don’t wish to comment on reports of wording or comments recently made. My focus is on creating a positive change and a lasting legacy for Brianna. Through Peace & Mind, we want to improve lives by empowering people, giving them the tools they need to build mental resilience, empathy and self-compassion through mindfulness. In developing these skills, I hope that we can create a more understanding, peaceful and stronger society for everyone.      2.53pm GMT  119 schools in England affected by Raac will have buildings replaced, DfE says  The government has announced that 119 schools and colleges in England affected by reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) will have buildings replaced as part of its long-term school rebuilding programme.In a written statement, Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, said:  Our priority will always be to ensure the safety of pupils and staff, which is why we took a cautious approach for schools and colleges. Although the technical advice does not recommend removal in all cases where it is present, we have taken a precautionary approach for the education estate in England to remove Raac.  The Department for Education said its national survey of schools and colleges, with buildings dating from when Raac was widely used in construction, was now complete. Its final update added three more, including Barking and Dagenham College, a further education college in east London, and Thornleigh Salesian College, a secondary school in greater Manchester.The DfE said that of the 234 found to have Raac-infested buildings, 119 are to get new buildings through its rebuilding programme, while 110 will receive grants to renovate or remove the affected parts. It said that “a small number” are still carrying out additional checks.There are roughly 500 schools in England awaiting rebuilds, with about 50 completed every year, meaning that some schools could be waiting for several years before the work is completed. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the rebuilding effort was welcome but raised further questions over funding. He said:  Given the severe pressures on the school estate as a whole, we need assurances that this work will be funded wholly through additional capital expenditure and money will not be diverted from other sources. There must also be clear timelines set out for when this work is going to be completed.  The Raac crisis was exposed at the end of last summer, after the government received further evidence that buildings including Raac were in danger of decay and collapse. By the end of August, days before the start of the new school year, the Guardian revealed that the DfE was telling schools to make contingency plans against the risk of collapse. It then abruptly ordered more than 100 schools to close. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said:  While dealing with Raac is crucial, we really need to see more ambitious investment from the government to bring the schools estate up to scratch overall – from Raac, to asbestos, to general disrepair – it needs a plan to tackle all school building issues before they become the next big crisis. That can’t happen without more money from the Treasury.   Updated at 2.54pm GMT    1.47pm GMT  No-fault evictions up 49% in England year-on-year as campaigners complain renters reform bill being stalled  Campaigners have criticised the government for delaying plans to ban no-fault evictions as new figures show a steep rise in repossessions in England, PA Media reports.  The latest statistics published by the Ministry of Justice show that some 26,311 accelerated possessions have been made from the second quarter of 2019 until the end of 2023. Landlords can apply for an accelerated possession order if their tenants have not left by the date specified in a section 21 notice. Section 21 of the Housing Act allows no-fault evictions. There were 9,457 such repossessions last year, up from 6,339 in 2022 – a 49% rise. As the figures were released, Commons leader Penny Mordaunt outlined upcoming business in parliament but made no mention of the renters (reform) bill. Labour’s Lucy Powell, responding in the Commons, complained that the report stage of the bill “was promised by early February, but it’s nowhere to be seen”. In a statement, the party’s shadow minister for housing and planning, Matthew Pennycook, said: “The stark rise in section 21 notices served last year lays bare the devastating impact that the Tories’ failure to abolish them is having on hard-pressed renters.” He vowed that if the government does not “get on and quickly pass the Bill abolishing section 21 evictions, that the next Labour government “will get the job done”. Tom Darling, campaign manager of the Renters’ Reform Coalition, described the bill as “on life-support after being deprioritised by the government”. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: “It’s utterly shameful that the government is bowing to vested interests while renters are marched out of their homes in their thousands.” And Ben Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, said: “Today sees the continuation of an awful trend that has been blighting the lives of renters across our country. As long as landlords can evict tenants through no fault of their own with just two months’ notice, homelessness in England will continue to soar. “Renters have been waiting five years since the government promised to end these evictions, and yet today we find out the government is delaying their plans again. Since that promise, almost 90,000 households have been forced out because of no-fault evictions – and this number is rising every day.”      1.21pm GMT  DfE says its Raac survey now complete and 234 schools in England found to have problem concrete  The number of schools and colleges in England with buildings affected by crumbling concrete, known as reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac), has risen to 234, the Department for Education today revealed. Three more schools have been added to the list since the DfE’s last update in December, including Barking and Dagenham College, a further education college in east London, and Thornleigh Salesian College, a secondary school in greater Manchester. The DfE said that of the 234 with Raac-infested buildings, 119 are currently listed to get new buildings through its school rebuilding programme, while 110 will receive grants to renovate or remove the affected parts. The DfE said its Raac identification programme launched last summer was now complete, with all schools and colleges with buildings likely to have used the material having responded to its survey.  All schools or colleges that advised us they suspect they might have Raac have had a survey to confirm if Raac is present. A small number of schools and colleges are carrying out additional checks for further assurance.   Updated at 1.53pm GMT    1.15pm GMT  Penny Mordaunt implicitly criticises Sunak's anti-trans jibe at PMQs, saying he should 'reflect' on his comments  Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has implicitly criticised Rishi Sunak for his anti-trans jibe at PMQs yesterday. Speaking during business questions, she suggested he made a mistake and she contrasted Sunak’s much-criticised joke with the emotional mini-speech given by a backbencher who recalled trying to take his life. She told MPs that she was sure that Sunak had “reflected” on what he said, and particularly what it might have meant to people who are trans. Sunak would be issuing a comment, she said. She implied Sunak might be about to express some regret for what he said.  But, in the statement he gave to the media this morning, Sunak did the opposite, refusing the accept that his remark was anti-trans and claiming that it was Labour that was in the wrong because it was using the murder of Brianna Ghey to criticise him. (See 11.07am.) Speaking in the Commons, referring to Brianna’s parents, Mordaunt said:   We’ve also seen a mother meeting the brutal murder of her child with the most profound grace and compassion, turning her anguish into positive action to protect other children.  And we’ve seen a father speak about how the love for his child enabled him to overcome his worries about her being trans. These are things that our nation is made of: compassion, fairness, tolerance, responsibility, service and love.  We see these things every day in the people that sent us here and we look on them with pride. Sometimes that pride is reciprocated. I’m sure it was for [Elliott Colburn] in what he said yesterday. [Colburn spoke very movingly at PMQs about how he tried to take his life and about the need for people feeling suicidal to realise “whatever you are going through, you are not alone, that help is out there, and better days lie ahead”.] And sometimes that pride is not reciprocated. Whatever the rough and tumble of this place, whatever the pressures and mistakes that are made in the heat of political combat, we owe it to the people who sent us here to strive every day to make them proud of us and this place. The prime minister is a good and caring man. I am sure that he has reflected on things and I understand he will say something later today, or perhaps even during this session. And that is not just about Mr and Mrs Ghey that he should reflect on, but I am sure he is also reflecting about people who are trans, or who have trans loved ones and family, some of whom sit on these green benches.  Mordaunt also said she thought Keir Starmer should reflect on his actions too, but her comments were seen as primarily aimed at her own party leader, not him. Mordaunt is one of the most liberal members of the government on trans issues. But during the Conservative leadership contest in 2022 her views on this topic badly damaged her campaign because she faced relentless criticism, led by papers backing Liz Truss, claiming she favoured self-identification for people wanting to change gender.  Updated at 1.16pm GMT    12.29pm GMT  Green industralist Dale Vince backs Labour's move on £28bn, saying it's 'arbitrary figure' and economic responsibility matters  Dale Vince, the green industrialist and Labour donor has come out in support of plans by Labour to ditch the £28bn number attached to its flagship green pledge, which he described as “an arbitrary figure which is distracting from the bigger picture”. In a statement he said:  Whether this policy is being ditched or being nailed to the mast, the truth is somewhere in the middle. I think Labour are entirely right to say the economy matters. I think voters want a responsible next government. The current Conservative government hasn’t been responsible with the nation’s money.This £28bn is an arbitrary figure which is distracting from the bigger picture.  Vince, who said last year that he ws to stop funding direct action climate groups such as Just Stop Oil and instead funnel money towards getting the vote out for Labour at the next general election, added that he was “confident a Labour government will pave the way to the biggest economic opportunity we have, and that’s to achieve energy independence”.     12.24pm GMT  Starmer to scale back home insulation scheme as part of green policy U-turn  Keir Starmer is cutting back his ambitious home insulation scheme as part of his decision to scale down Labour’s green policy, Kiran Stacey reports. Kiran says:  The Labour leader will announce on Thursday that he is drastically reducing the scale of the £28bn “green prosperity plan” after weeks of uncertainty over the fate of the plan. People briefed on the scaled-back plan say the party’s home insulation scheme, which was singled out for attack by the Conservatives earlier this week, would be the major victim of the cuts. One person added they expected Labour to promise an additional £5bn a year of additional green spending on top of what the government has already committed, allowing the party to stick to its separate pledge to cut government debt levels.  The full story is here.   Related: Starmer to scale back home insulation scheme as part of green policy U-turn        12.21pm GMT   Here is more criticism of Labour’s decision to drop its £28bn target for green investment spending from environmentalists, progressive campaigners, and policy experts (or people who qualify as all three). From Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, a leftwing thinktank  It is deeply disappointing that on the day scientists say global warming has exceeded 1.5C across an entire year for the first time, Labour is set to ditch its £28bn green investment plan.  This figure is not an arbitrary number. It is what the UK needs to lower emissions and create an economy that improves lives.   From Fatima Ibrahim, co-drector of the campaign group Green New Deal Rising  Scrapping Labour’s £28bn commitment is a cowardly and shortsighted capitulation to the government, and leaves Starmer with no plan for growth and no way of tackling climate change …Young people are watching and will hold Labour to account to deliver a Green New Deal that responds to the scale of the cost of living crisis and climate catastrophe we face.  From Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank  A lack of investment in insulating homes and building more British renewables over the past decade left UK households on the hook for high gas prices, which cost bill payers and taxpayers in the region of £50-60bn in one year alone. Each home could have saved up to around £2,000 last year had we made those investments. If we want warm homes, reasonable bills, and energy independence, investment is required. Switching to heat pumps will leave us less dependent on foreign gas imports, running our home heating instead on electricity from British renewables. There is a global economic race to build clean industries and Britain has to compete for green investment. Investors are looking for policy certainty and a clear plan from policy makers.  From Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK  Dropping the green investment pledge would be weak political, economic and climate leadership from Starmer before he’s even got his feet under the table … Investing around £28bn extra per year in green technologies of the future will be needed from any future government willing to fix this broken country, insulate our homes, better our health, restore nature, improve public transport and slash emissions. Without this level of serious investment Starmer risks leaving the door wide open for the EU, US and China to overtake us in the global green tech race. This is a vision worth fighting for, not retreating from. Or voters will start wondering what the Labour party actually stands for.      12.08pm GMT  Streeting says latest NHS figures show people 'waiting longer for NHS treatment than ever before'  Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, says today’s NHS England waiting time figures show that people are waiting longer for hospital treatment than ever before. He has released a statement saying:  People are waiting longer for NHS treatment than ever before, and waiting lists are 400,000 longer than when Sunak became prime minister. The last Labour government cut the maximum waiting time from 18 months to 18 weeks. After 14 years of Conservative vandalism of the NHS, more patients wait longer than 18 weeks than ever before, and the number of patients waiting 18 months has doubled in the past few months. Things are getting worse and worse. Labour will get patients treated on time with 2 million more weekend and evening appointments, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status. Only Labour can get the NHS back on its feet.  The headline waiting list figure for NHS hospitals in England has fallen marginally, according to today’s figures. (See 9.54am.) But Streeting is referring to figures showing that only 56.6% of patients get seen within 18 weeks, the target set out in the NHS constitution. This is the lowest proportion in recorded data going back to 2007. And the median wait is 15 weeks, which is also the worst figure in the recorded data.     11.47am GMT  NHS figures show big increase in January in long waits in A&E in English hospitals  There has been a sharp rise in people facing long waits in A&E, though the overall NHS waiting list continues to fall, PA Media reports. PA says:  An estimated 7.60 million treatments were waiting to be carried out in England at the end of December, relating to 6.37 million patients, down slightly from 7.61 million treatments and 6.39 million patients at the end of November, according to NHS England. But hospitals were clearly under pressure as winter took hold, with the number of people waiting more than 12 hours in A&E departments from a decision to admit them to actually being admitted hitting 54,308 in January, up sharply from 44,045 in December. This is the second highest figure on record, just below the record 54,573 in December 2022. The number of people waiting at least four hours from the decision to admit to admission has also risen, from 148,282 in December to 158,721 last month – again, the second highest figure on record. NHS England said A&E and ambulance services experienced their busiest ever January. It said there were 2.23 million A&E attendances, with more than a 10% increase in emergency admissions from A&E, compared with the same month last year. Junior doctors in England staged the longest strike in NHS history in January, for six full days from 3 January to 9 January. Today’s waiting times data also revealed some NHS waits for planned treatment are getting worse. Some 13,164 people in England had been waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment at the end of December, up from 11,168 at the end of November. The government and NHS England set the ambition of eliminating all waits of more than 18 months by April 2023, excluding exceptionally complex cases or patients who choose to wait longer. Elsewhere, 337,450 people in England had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start treatment at the end of December, down from 355,412 at the end of November.   Updated at 11.52am GMT    11.33am GMT       11.31am GMT  Michael Matheson resigns as Scotland's health secretary over iPad roaming charges controversy  Michael Matheson has quit as Scotland’s health secretary, saying he was leaving the post so the row over his iPad roaming charges “does not become a distraction” to the government, PA Media reports. PA says:  Matheson had been under fire since November last year when details of an £11,000 bill on his Holyrood-issued iPad were made public. In an emotional statement to MSPs, he revealed his teenage sons had been using the device as a hotspot so they could watch football while on a family holiday to Morocco. The then health secretary, however, had originally insisted the charges had been run up while he was using it for constituency work during the break. When he learned of his children’s use of the device, Mr Matheson paid back the charges, which had originally been picked up by the Scottish Parliament. With the Scottish parliament corporate body conducting an investigation, Matheson said he was “conscious that this process will conclude in the coming weeks”. In a letter to the first minister, Humza Yousaf, he said: “It is in the best interests of myself and the government for me now to step down to ensure that this does not become a distraction to taking forward the government’s agenda.”  Matheson has posted his statement on X.  Statement pic.twitter.com/4Fc5XPnjyD— Michael Matheson MSP (@MathesonMichael) February 8, 2024      11.25am GMT  Sunak claims Labour's U-turn show he's right to say Starmer 'doesn't have a plan'  Rishi Sunak has claimed that Labour’s U-turn over £28bn as the target for Labour’s green investment spending confirms Tory claims that Keir Starmer “doesn’t have a plan”. Speaking to reporters in Cornwall, where he was asked about the Labour story, Sunak said:  This is a serious moment. This was the flagship plank of Labour’s economic policy and it now looks like he’s trying to wriggle out of it. I think it demonstrates exactly what I’ve been saying, that he U-turns on major things, he can’t say what he would do differently because he doesn’t have a plan. And if you don’t have a plan, then you can’t deliver change for our country. In contrast, our plan is working and people can see that. Inflation has come down, mortgage rates are starting to come down and because economic conditions have improved, we’ve been able to start cutting people’s taxes.  This is slightly different from the argument the Conservative party was making last night, which was that in reality Starmer remains committed to green plans that would cost £28bn a year. (See 10.26am.)     11.07am GMT  Sunak refuses to apologise for anti-trans jibe, saying linking what he said to Brianna Ghey tragedy was 'worst of politics'  Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise for the anti-trans jibe he made about Keir Starmer at PMQs yesterday, after being told Brianna Ghey’s mother would be listening in the public gallery. Speaking to journalists in Cornwall, Sunak insisted that he was just making a point about Starmer. And he said that to link what he said to the death of Brianna, whose murder was partly motivated by transphobia, was “the worst of politics”. Labour and other opposition parties have said Sunak should apologise for what he said and Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, backed those calls, saying Sunak’s remark was “absolutely dehumanising”. But, when asked today if he would apologise, Sunak said:  If you look at what I said, I was very clear, talking about Keir Starmer’s proven track record of U-turns on major policies because he doesn’t have a plan. A point only proven by today’s reports that the Labour party and Keir Starmer are apparently planning to reverse on their signature economic green spending policy. That just demonstrates the point I was making. He’s someone who has just consistently changed his mind on a whole range of major things. I think that is an absolutely legitimate thing to point out and it demonstrates that he doesn’t have a plan for the country.  Sunak said he was “completely shocked” by the murder of Brianna, and he said he had “nothing but the most heartfelt sympathy for her entire family and friends”. He went on:  But to use that tragedy to detract from the very separate and clear point I was making about Keir Starmer’s proven track record of multiple U-turns on major policies, because he doesn’t have a plan, I think is both sad and wrong, and it demonstrates the worst of politics.  This is an echo of the argument used by Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary and minister for women and equalities, yesterday when she argued that it was Starmer, not Sunak, who was disresepecting the Ghey family. During PMQs Sunak said: “I think I counted almost 30 [Starmer U-turns] in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.” The 99% joke was primarily aimed at Starmer, but it also entailed implicit mockery of trans people because it was a reference to an interview Starmer gave in which he said 99.9% of women did not have a penis.   Updated at 11.21am GMT    10.33am GMT   Environmental campaigners are also criticising Labour for abandoning £28bn as its target for green investment. This is from Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuels campaigning at Global Witness.  Today’s announcement will give confidence to the oil and gas industry and those who stand to benefit from a fossil fuel energy system. For the rest of us, faced with unaffordable energy bills, fossil fuel-funded wars, and the floods, storms and droughts that the climate crisis brings, this is a deeply disappointing signal on the low level of ambition a future government has when it comes to the biggest challenge the world is facing.  And this is from Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth.  Green investment doesn’t just deliver for the planet; it also benefits our health and economy. Cutting it would be shortsighted and cost the country dearly. The UK is already lagging behind in the race to manufacture green steel, build electric vehicles, and develop giga-battery factories. Thousands of jobs are at risk if we don’t match the investment the US and the rest of Europe are making in these industries … For years UK climate action has been undermined by dither, delay and lukewarm support from government. We urgently need real political leadership to confront the climate crisis and seize the huge opportunities that building a greener future would bring.   Updated at 10.38am GMT    10.26am GMT  Tories claim that, despite Labour's 'attempted U-turn', Starmer still committed to £28bn green investment plan  The Conservative party issued their initial response to the news that Labour is formally dropping £28bn as the annual arget for its green investment spending last night. Having attacked Labour obsessively for having the target in recent weeks, arguing that it would have to be funded by higher borrowing or higher taxes, or both, the Tories could embrace the U-turn and argue that it shows Keir Starmer is unreliable. Alternatively, they could argue that in practice the target has not been dropped because Labour is still firmly committed to clean energy goals that require spending on that scale. But, at the risk of causing some confusion, CCHQ is trying to run both lines of attack. Its new release described the move as an “attempted £28bn U-turn” and included this quote from Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury.  This is a serious moment which confirms Labour have no plan for the UK, creating uncertainty for business and our economy. On the day that Labour are finalising their manifesto, Keir Starmer is torpedoing what he has claimed to be his central economic policy purely for short-term campaigning reasons. He must explain how he can keep the £28bn spending when he is finally admitting he doesn’t have a plan to pay for it. This black hole will inevitably mean thousands of pounds in higher taxes for working people. That’s why Labour will take Britain back to square one.  In an explanatory note in the news release, the Tories said “Labour remain committed to their ‘Green Prosperity’ policy, which Labour have costed at £28bn a year”.  Updated at 10.38am GMT    10.10am GMT  Minister defends Sunak’s transgender jibe amid calls for apology  Chris Philp, the policing minister, has defended Rishi Sunak’s transgender jibe after the father of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey called on the prime minister to apologise. Eleni Courea has the story here.   Related: Minister defends Sunak’s transgender jibe amid calls for apology       10.09am GMT   This is what Momentum, the leftwing Labour group, said about the party dropping £28bn as the target for its green investment plan in posts on X last night.

By breaking every promise, they are sewing distrust in the party & politics.  By capitulating to Tory attacks, they are strengthening the Right and a false economic narrative.  By watering down what few progressive policies remain, they are undermining Labour’s chances of tackling Britain’s crises in government.   Politics is about choices.  Last week Starmer & Reeves chose to cap corporation tax & uncapped banker bonuses.  This week, they’re choosing to water down investment in climate action, green jobs & warmer homes.  We need real Labour values      9.54am GMT  Hospital waiting list for England fell slightly in December, for third month in row, figures show  The waiting list for routine hospital treatment in England has fallen for the third month in a row, PA Media reports.  An estimated 7.60 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of December, relating to 6.37 million patients, down slightly from 7.61 million treatments and 6.39 million patients at the end of November, NHS England said.     9.50am GMT  Britain needs 'more not less investment', says Unite, as it urges Labour to resist Tories' 'false accusations'  Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, has criticised the Labour move on the grounds that the UK needs more investment, not less. She said:  The retreat from Labour’s £28bn green investment pledge will confirm workers’ scepticism of the endless promises of jam tomorrow and it will be ‘alright on the night’ rhetoric on the green transition. If different choices aren’t made Britain will again lag behind other nations. The German government investment bank already has in its funds equivalent to 15% of German GDP. The Labour movement has to stand up to the Conservatives’ false accusations of fiscal irresponsibility. There is a catastrophic crisis of investment in Britain’s economic infrastructure. Britain needs more not less investment.      9.43am GMT  Labour's U-turn 'will destroy Scottish jobs', says SNP  The SNP claims Labour’s U-turn will damage the Scottish economy. This is from Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster.  Keir Starmer’s damaging decision to cut energy investment will destroy Scottish jobs, harm economic growth and hit families in the pocket by keeping energy bills high. It’s a weak and short-sighted U-turn, which shows Westminster is incapable of delivering the investment Scotland needs to compete in the global green energy gold rush and secure strong economic growth. As our partners and allies across the world press ahead with investment to attract jobs and secure economic and energy security, the UK has turned away. It’s as depressing as it is predictable.      9.41am GMT  Labour's U-turn on £28bn green investment pledge 'a massive backward step', says Green party  The Green party has described the Labour U-turn as a “massive backwards step”. This is from Carla Denyer, the party’s co-leader.  This is a massive backward step – for the climate, for the economy and for good quality jobs. Both the security of our planet for future generations and the UK’s future prosperity is dependent on greening our economy and that requires large scale investment.  Labour have chosen to wear their fiscal rules as a millstone around their neck. A different approach through tax reforms, in particular by introducing a wealth tax on the super-rich, could help pay for the green transition. There is more than enough money in the economy to pay for this. Indeed, the Green party would go further and faster, investing at least double what Labour originally pledged, so we can turbo charge the transition to a green economy.      9.27am GMT  'Economically illiterate, strategically incompetent' - Labour's left criticises Starmer's £28bn green investment U-turn  Good morning. It will come as no surprise to anyone who has been following Westminster news in recent weeks, particularly if they have been reading the Guardian, to learn that Labour is no longer committed to spending £28bn a year on its green investment plan. The soft U-turn, the informal abandonment of the policy as a firm commitment, happened some time ago. But the Tory attacks on the policy, and today we are expecting a proper, hard, bells-and-whistles U-turn – public confirmation that the £28bn target has been consigned to the policy dustbin. Kiran Stacey and Pippa Crerar broke the news last night.   Related: Starmer to announce scaling back of £28bn green investment plan   As they explain, it’s a gamble. The case for getting rid of it is that it allowed the Tories to claim Labour would have to put up taxes to fund it, perhaps reviving the almost primordial fear felt by the British electorate that a Labour government would cost people more. With £28bn off the table, it is harder what policies the Conservatives would attack during an election campaign. But, if the U-turn inoculates Labour against the “higher taxes” attack, it validates the other key message coming out of CCHQ, which is that you can’t trust Keir Starmer on anything because he keeps changing his mind. It also makes it harder for Labour to argue that it is offering a distinctive alternative policy at the election because one of its main economic policies has, in effect, been redrafted at the behest of CCHQ. This latter point is one that Starmer’s critics on the left – both within the Labour party, and outside it – have been making vigorously this morning. There are strong statements to this effect from the SNP, the Green party, Unite and Momentum, but let’s start with the Labour MP Barry Gardiner, who served as shadow climage change minister under Jeremy Corbyn. This is what he told the Today programme when he was asked for his reaction to the U-turn.  It’s economically illiterate, it’s environmentally irresponsible and it’s politically jejune.  Gardiner said he could understand why Labour wanted to minimise the risk of its policies being attacked. But he went on:  If you make [your manifesto] so bland, if you stand for nothing, then the opposition and government will actually write your policies for you, they will say ‘You see, Labour’s not telling you what they’re going to do, it’s going to be this it’s going to be that’, and they can paint their own picture. So I think politically, it’s strategically incompetent.  I will post more reaction shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: NHS England publishes hospital waiting time figures. 9.30am: The ONS publishes homicide figures for England and Wales. Morning: Rishi Sunak is on a visit to Cornwall where he is expected to speak to the media. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Noon: Humza Yousaf takes first minister’s questions at Holyrood. Afternoon: Keir Starmer is expected to make an announcement confirming the £28bn green investment plan U-turn.

        "content": "There was a deep despair hanging over No 10. A slough of despond. Staff tiptoed from room to room, anxious not to create a disturbance or catch one another’s eyes. Few words were spoken and then only in whispers. “Where’s Rishi?” asked Isaac Levido. “He’s locked in his study,” replied James Forsyth. “He won’t come out. He’s been sobbing for hours. All he can do to distract himself from his PMQs disaster is to watch his new two-and-a-half-minute flipchart party political broadcast on repeat.” Levido: “Hmm. That bad. Well, let’s just hope he doesn’t notice that he made three spelling mistakes. The halfwit can’t even get ‘furlough’, ‘priorities’ and ‘mortgage’ right … ”  Forsyth: “I’m sure no one will notice. And it’s not as bad as Jezza. He can’t count. My main worry is he will realise he forgot to list ‘Brexit’, ‘Liz Truss’ and ‘14 years of Tory fuck-ups’ in the list of reasons why the economy was tanking.” But this was all comparatively minor stuff under the circumstances. They could live with yet another video clip that made them look as if they didn’t know what they were doing. The Tory Top Team were more worried about getting through the next 24 hours without looking as if they were insulting the parents of a murdered child. Levido took Forsyth to one side. “We need a plan. Urgently,” he said. So far nothing had worked. They had tried Kemi Badenoch. She had merely started yet another culture war, claiming it had been Keir Starmer’s fault that Sunak had made a joke about trans issues while Brianna Ghey’s mother had been in parliament. It had been Labour who had politicised the parents’ grief. It was just that the parents were too dumb to realise this. Then they had sent out Jeremy Hunt. He had merely insisted nothing was true and that none of this had ever happened. Jezza is finding reality increasingly hard to bear. For a last hurrah, the terminally dim Laura Trott had tried to convince herself that Rishi hadn’t been making a joke. Which made you wonder why he, Victoria Atkins and dozens of Tory MPs had been laughing hysterically. Perhaps they were all just having a collective breakdown. “We’ll need a useful idiot for the morning media round,” said Levido. “Someone too stupid to realise he’s been set up. Someone completely expendable. Someone we can rely on to say the unsayable.” Isaac and James looked at each other and spontaneously shouted in unison. “Send for Chris Philp.” Provided they could extract his nose from someone’s arse in time, he would be ideal. So shortly after 7am, Philp appeared on BBC Breakfast. The presenter, Naga Munchetty, was unimpressed. Six times she asked whether the minister felt that Sunak’s joke had been appropriate and respectful and six times Philp had just shrugged and avoided giving an answer. He really wasn’t that bothered. Hell, it wasn’t his child who had been murdered, so just relax. Maybe Brianna’s parents should learn to take a joke. You could sense the disbelief in Munchetty. Regardless of the rights and the wrongs of the trans debates, how about some sensitivity and decency? Brianna’s father had said he found the prime minister’s comments dehumanising and had asked for an apology. Was Philp saying that Peter Spooner was wrong? Well … yes, that’s precisely what he was saying, come to think of it. Maybe Brianna’s parents were a bit thick and had missed the point. They needed to chill out and listen a bit more carefully before they rushed to take offence. Because he, Chris, the Mighty Philpster, had gone back to listen to what Sunak had said. And what he had heard was an outpouring of tenderness from Rishi and vile, transphobic hate from Keir Starmer. So maybe everyone should shut up a bit and listen to the Philp remix. There would be no apologies. No nothing. This was a battle the Tory right were prepared to fight to the death. Sure it would have been better if Esther Ghey had not been there, but there was a principle at stake. Which was that it’s fine to make trans gags in parliament. A short while later, a red-eyed Rishi sneaked into the Downing Street kitchen. Levido was there waiting for him. “Cheer up,” he said. “I’ve got a fun day planned for you. We’re going to forget your inability to read the room and depart from a script when required. You’re going to go for a nice, pointless ride in your favourite helicopter to Cornwall. You’ll like that. And here you’re just going to double down and say it’s Brianna’s parents who ought to be apologising for having misunderstood you. Where’s their gratitude? In any case, it’s not as if we’re going to win the election so it will make no difference. So might as well be true to our Inner Bastard.” It wasn’t just the Tories who were thinking about the election. Over at Labour HQ, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were deep in conversation over the fate of their £28bn a year green commitment. “Maybe it would be best if we didn’t have any plans at all,” said Starmer. “That way, the Tories can never accuse us of making unfunded spending promises.” “Look,” replied Reeves. Talking extra slowly because she knew Keir had difficulty with large numbers. “All I’ve said is that the economic climate has changed since we came up with the plan two years ago. Interest rates have rocketed and the Tories have spunked all the money on tax cuts. So we don’t have to abandon the whole policy. Just say we will do as much of it as we can under the fiscal rules.” This sounded far too sensible to Starmer. He had always been secretly more impressed by Jezza, who couldn’t operate a pocket calculator, than his own shadow chancellor who had worked at the Bank of England. “The Tories keep saying we flip-flop,” he squeaked, the panic evident in his voice. “So maybe the best thing we can do is to flip-flop. At least that shows we’re being consistent.” What people wanted was nothing in which to believe. After 14 years of big ideas from the Tories, they wanted really small ones from a Labour government. Ones that really wouldn’t make a difference. Quantum policies. Ones that could be both there and not there. “I’ll tell you what I’m going to do,” said Starmer. “I’m going to summon the press to a secret Q&A where no cameras are allowed. Because if it’s not filmed, no one can say for certain if it ever happened. And then I’m going to cancel the £28bn.” “But we’ve already cancelled it several times before,” observed Reeves drily. “That’s the beauty of it. We’ll say it’s been cancelled but no one can be really sure. So we could always bring it back next week if we feel like it. Brilliant, isn’t it?” This was shaping up into the election no one wanted to win."

        "content": "Keir Starmer is cutting back his ambitious home insulation scheme as part of his decision to scale down Labour’s green policy, sources have told the Guardian. The Labour leader will announce on Thursday that he is drastically reducing the scale of the £28bn “green prosperity plan” after weeks of uncertainty over the fate of the plan. People briefed on the scaled-back plan say the party’s home insulation scheme, which was singled out for attack by the Conservatives earlier this week, would be the major victim of the cuts. One person added they expected Labour to promise an additional £5bn a year of additional green spending on top of what the government has already committed, allowing the party to stick to its separate pledge to cut government debt levels. Starmer is expected to formally announce the U-turn later on Thursday after heavy speculation about whether the £28bn could survive in its original form. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, first announced it at the Labour party conference in 2021, as she promised to be the UK’s “first green chancellor”. Since then, however, Reeves has become much more sceptical about the policy, with economic analysis showing that sticking to the £28bn would violate Labour’s separate promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output by the end of a five-year period. Starmer has been lobbied heavily in recent weeks both by supporters of the plan, who say it forms the main plank of Labour’s economic policy, and opponents, who worry it could be used against the party in a general election campaign. The Conservatives have claimed that Labour is preparing to put up taxes to help pay for the scheme, though Reeves has denied this. The home insulation scheme is the largest single item in the green plan, with Labour having promised to spend up to £6bn a year to insulate 19m homes over a decade. A government analysis commissioned by the Conservatives earlier this week suggested the plan could actually cost double that, though Labour said it would fund the scheme through private sector incentives as well as public spending. However, some experts criticised the Treasury for having released the document at all, given Labour has explicitly said it will spend a maximum of £6bn on the scheme. Nick Macpherson, a former lead civil servant at the Treasury, tweeted on Wednesday: “Since time immemorial, whatever the party in power, these costings have had little if any credibility.”   Over the next 9 months, we will have tobtolerate many an \"official Treasury\" costing of Opposition policy. Since time immemorial, whatever the party in power, these costings have had little if any credibility. Political advisers determine the assumptions. #rubbishinrubbishout— Nick Macpherson (@nickmacpherson2) February 7, 2024  Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, said on Thursday morning that Starmer’s decision showed his lack of consistency. “This is a serious moment,” he said. “This was the flagship plank of Labour’s economic policy and it now looks like he’s trying to wriggle out of it.” Sunak added: “I think it demonstrates exactly what I’ve been saying, that he U-turns on major things, he can’t say what he would do differently because he doesn’t have a plan. And if you don’t have a plan, then you can’t deliver change for our country.” Starmer was also under fire on Thursday morning from both environmentalists and the left of his party. Barry Gardiner, the former shadow energy secretary, told the BBC: “Politically, it’s strategically incompetent.” Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “If we want warm homes, reasonable bills, and energy independence, investment is required. Switching to heat pumps will leave us less dependent on foreign gas imports, running our home heating instead on electricity from British renewables. “There is a global economic race to build clean industries and Britain has to compete for green investment.”"

        "content": "An Italian man has been removed from the UK despite holding a Home Office certificate explicitly stating he has a right to travel in and out of the country while officials process his application to live and work in the country post-Brexit. Massimiliano Melargo, 27, told how he was detained overnight, separated from his Ukrainian partner, and put on the first plane to Venice by Border Force officials in a step lawyers say contravenes the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK. “I don’t feel great because I am away from my girlfriend, I have lost my job and I’m going to lose the deposit on my flat,” said Melargo. He had left the country for a birthday holiday break in Finland and was originally told he would be removed to Helsinki when he was stopped at Gatwick. He said he feared he could not come back to pick up his belongings or to visit his girlfriend of five years, or his sister, who has been in the country for 12 years. “I feel that even If I go there to visit I will have problems. It’s very disappointing. It’s going to be difficult to come back even as a tourist,” he said. “My detention and then removal is causing me and my partner immense distress and hardship. “I am a law-abiding, upstanding good citizen, certainly not deserving of the treatment I was given by being detained and treated like a delinquent and removed. I am contributing fully to the country’s economy and society,” he added. Melargo had lived in the UK before Brexit and had made a late application to remain in the country using the Brexit EU settlement scheme set up for the millions of EU citizens living in the country before the UK withdrew from the bloc in 2021. The hospitality worker had left the country before Brexit and intended to return before the end of 2020 to secure his rights, but was unable to because of lockdowns and Covid-related travel bans. He returned to the UK after Brexit and submitted a late application for the EU settlement scheme in January 2023. This was rejected but he immediate appealed. He said he believed he was “unlawfully removed” because the Home Office Certification of Application (CoA), which notifies a future employer or landlord of a person’s right to work and rent property while awaiting a decision, states he can travel. It says: “Your certificate of application allows you to travel in and out of the UK pending a final decision on your application, including during any appeal.” Confusingly, it also advises against travel in and out of the country, and on a previous occasion when Merlago returned from holiday he was not stopped. It appears the border officials relied on a paragraph in the CoA which states that someone “may also be asked for evidence to show that you were resident in the UK by 31 December 2020”, such as a national insurance or HMRC record. Luke Piper, a lawyer with the Work Rights Centre and an EU settlement scheme specialist, said the rights of EU citizens were guaranteed under the withdrawal agreement, including during an application process. “The Home Office appears to be overstepping its powers and allowing Border Force to pre-judge the case before the appeal has been concluded. These appeals should be reviewed, processed and concluded before there can be a decision on entry to the country by Border Force. “What happens at the border appears to be down to the officer who sees you on the day. The whole point of the certificate of application is to demonstrate that you are in an application process that has not been concluded. Confusingly it tells recipients they can travel but also says they shouldn’t. It’s Kafkaesque.” In response, the Home Office suggested it was key for all those travelling with a CoA to also carry proof of living in the country before Brexit. A spokesperson said: “A Certificate of Application issued under the EU settlement scheme advises the holder that, if they travel overseas, they may be asked for evidence that they qualify under the scheme in order to re-enter the UK. “Border Force officers may stop any arriving passenger for the purposes of further examination where they are not immediately satisfied that they qualify for entry.”"

        "content": "A government minister has defended Rishi Sunak’s transgender jibe after the father of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey called on the prime minister to apologise.\nChris Philp, the policing minister, insisted on BBC Breakfast that Sunak had “made no reference at all to any individual trans people” and was instead “making a point about Labour’s very numerous flip-flops”.\nSunak is under pressure to apologise for making a joke at the expense of transgender people at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, just after he was told by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that Brianna’s mother, Esther Ghey, was in the public gallery.\nBrianna, who was transgender, was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered by two teenagers in February last year. Starmer welcomed Esther Ghey to the Commons on Wednesday and praised her “unwavering bravery” before asking Sunak a question about NHS waiting lists.\nIn response the prime minister listed what he called broken Labour promises, telling the Commons: “I think I counted almost 30 in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.”\nThe jibe drew cries of “shame” from opposition MPs, who called for Sunak to apologise. A visibly angry Starmer responded: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in the chamber.”\nBrianna’s father, Peter Spooner, said Sunak’s remark was “absolutely dehumanising” and called for him to apologise. “For the prime minister of our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising,” he told Sky News.\nFacing questions about the controversy on Thursday morning, Philp declined six times on BBC Breakfast to say whether he thought Sunak’s jibe was appropriate or respectful.\nAsked whether he was suggesting that Brianna’s father had misunderstood the prime minister’s remark, Philp said he was “very sad” to read Spooner’s response and added: “I have got every respect for, obviously, the views and feelings of a bereaved father.”\nHe insisted that the prime minister was making a political point about Labour and that Starmer was “actually wrong” to bring up Brianna after Sunak’s remark.\n“It is of course important to conduct public debate respectfully,” Philp told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “That is why I think it was actually wrong of Keir Starmer to introduce Brianna as a subject in the next question, because Rishi Sunak had not made any reference to any individuals.”\nSunak has offered to meet Esther Ghey but no meeting has been publicly confirmed.\nAlthough some Conservative MPs have criticised Sunak’s remark, the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, accused Starmer of trying to use Brianna’s murder for “political point-scoring”.\nPhilp told Times Radio: “The point the prime minister was making was about flip-flops and U-turns, and he listed about 10 different flip-flops and U-turns that Keir Starmer’s made – he’s making another one, I understand, later on today, on this £28bn that seems to be vanishing or is being U-turned, or they’re saying they can do the policy without it costing anything, or some similar nonsense.”\n“So, the PM was trying to highlight Keir Starmer’s flip-flops and U-turns, and that I think was an understandable thing to do.”\n“As a more general point, when talking about difficult and sensitive issues, it is obviously important for everyone in public life, all of us – journalists, politicians, everybody – just to use measured and respectful language.”"

        "content": "British defence intelligence officials say the UK is closer to a large-scale conflict than at any recent point, as the Middle East crisis intensifies while Russia pursues an expansionist agenda and China develops advanced weapons. One senior official said the secretive 4,500-strong unit was the busiest it had been in at least a decade, and said the fast turnover of ministers made it harder to ensure key politicians were making informed decisions. The official was asked if they agreed with Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, who said in a speech last month that the UK and the west was “moving from a postwar to a prewar world”. The official, based in defence intelligence and speaking on condition of anonymity, cited Russia’s continuing attack on Ukraine and the possibility of an expansion of the conflict, while adding that it remained possible China would attempt to take Taiwan by force. “Is there a likelihood of a large-scale conflict? Yes, there is. It’s probably more likely than it has been at any recent point,” they said, reflecting a period of instability deepened by the Israel-Gaza war and US-led bombing campaigns against Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iranian-back militias in Iran and Syria. A particular challenge, they added, was dealing with “the turnover of decision makers” during years of Conservative turmoil. Three prime ministers, four foreign secretaries and two defence secretaries have served since late 2019, the course of the current parliament. Senior officials and military leaders had a “responsibility to educate”, the senior defence official argued, recognising that politicians often came to defence and foreign policy roles with little experience of international or military affairs. An exception is David Cameron, a former prime minister who was unexpectedly appointed last year by Rishi Sunak as foreign secretary. Shapps was given the job of defence secretary last September despite no experience of military affairs. Defence Intelligence is not a statutory spy agency like MI5, MI6 and GCHQ but nevertheless forms a key part of Britain’s secret state, tasked with monitoring military threats, activity and conflict worldwide. Outside London, its principal operation is at RAF Wyton, in Cambridgeshire. Dozens of teams operate at the base, aggregated into a newsroom the size of a football pitch in a building called Pathfinder. Monitoring desks displaying maps, satellite imagery, drone footage or other feeds from conflict zones or other regions are arranged in honeycomb banks to allow for team working. The complex range of activities include using remote imagery to identifying potential Houthi missile and radar sites, which have been bombed three times by the US and UK since mid-January. Identical tools are used to conduct damage assessment and assess casualties from a distance. In keeping with Five Eyes practice, all raw intelligence is shared with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and officials from all countries operate inside Pathfinder. Monitoring activities follow the sun, with the newsroom handing over to the US in the evening and picking up from New Zealand in the morning. One team, DI Watch, operates on a 24-hour basis, tasked with continually monitoring reports of violence or conflict. If thought necessary, a cross-government alert should be produced within 10 minutes and a slide with context and a graphic, similar to the US Discord leaks, distributed within an hour. An open source intelligence team relies on satellite imagery to monitor developments in military installations in Russia, China and elsewhere. Last month, some of its work was sent to a panel of UN experts showing satellite photos of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia, said to be weapons. Another group specialises in mapping locations using drones and lasers, and regularly assists British police. Its 3D visualisations help officers provide security for large events in the UK, while the drone team to helped discover footprints left by the killer of the Hull student Libby Squire as he dumped her body in a river. A capability assessments team monitors weapons developed by adversaries. Its recent work has included an examination of the DF-27, a Chinese hypersonic missile that emerged in 2022. It has a range of about 3,100 miles (5,000km) and can travel more than five times the speed of sound, making it difficult to shoot down soon after launch. A second defence official emphasised that Beijing was still considered the longer-term threat because of its size and technological capability, despite the series of current conflicts. They said there were “storms in the Middle East and a hurricane in Ukraine but China is climate change”. • This article was amended on 8 February 2024 to replace an unsuitable image."

        "content": "Britain is in the throes of a hidden poverty “epidemic”, with the worst-affected households living in squalor and going without food, heating and everyday basics such as clean clothes and toothpaste, the former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Brown accused the government of creating a wall of silence around “obscene” levels of destitution in the UK and criticised ministers for “systematically shredding” a social security system that had once provided a safety net for the poorest. He said it was a “moral outrage” that the government was unwilling to tackle a social emergency that had created millions of forgotten and voiceless victims, one he compared in an article for the Guardian with the Post Office scandal in terms of the scale of ministerial neglect. “In years to come, I believe people will be asking how it was that government walked by on the other side when thousands of children were suffering abject deprivation, and failed to support them in their hours of need,” he said. He described the poverty he had witnessed in his home town of Kirkcaldy, where 70% of children were in poverty in some neighbourhoods, as the worst he had seen in his lifetime.  “In 2010, we were helping 100 children at Christmas [through charity schemes]. Last Christmas, it was 1,800,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. He described Britain as “haunted by poverty we thought had been consigned to history”. The situation was deteriorating for destitute families whose children lacked proper clothing, or had to share beds, whose parents felt shame because they could not provide and feared their children would be taken into care as a result, he said. Brown challenged the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to use his March budget to address the suffering of families for whom 2024 was shaping up to be, financially, the worst year in living memory. “In an advanced economy, understanding these privations shouldn’t be a question of ideology but a question of decency,” he said. He called on Hunt to undertake a root-and-branch review of universal credit, and extend the government’s £900m cost of living crisis household support fund, currently at risk of being axed from April. The fund provides emergency help, such as food vouchers, beds and cookers to struggling families. Brown’s comments came as he published a review of UK hardship on behalf of his Multibank project, a network of local charities developed out of the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown, which sources and distributes millions of surplus goods to families in need, from soap and shampoo to beds, nappies and toilet rolls. The review predicts the current crisis – “the ‘cost of living crisis’ is the phrase, but ‘the cost of staying alive crisis’ might be a better description” – will continue for many households because food and fuel prices remain high and universal credit levels are far too low to meet rising bills. As a chancellor and then prime minister in Labour governments between 1997 and 2010, Brown oversaw ambitious plans that significantly reduced levels of UK poverty through spending on tax credits and social programmes such as the minimum wage and Sure Start. The subsequent huge cuts to welfare spending under coalition and Tory governments from 2010 led to a collapse in benefit levels and an explosion in severe poverty.  In 2022, an estimated 1 million children experienced destitution, meaning their families were unable to afford to properly feed, clothe or clean them, or keep them warm. Brown told the Guardian an urgent overhaul of the main low income benefit, universal credit, was needed. It was currently inadequate to meet basic living costs and, for many families, was further weakened by cash deductions made through the two-child limit, benefit cap and bedroom tax. However, he declined to say how much would be needed to upgrade universal credit. Brown has not been an MP since 2015, and said it was “not his role to write policy”.  Last year, the party was engulfed by a heated internal debate over whether to scrap the two-child limit, a move the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, subsequently ruled out. A government spokesperson said: “There are 1.7 million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared to 2010, including 400,000 children, but we know people continue to struggle so are providing record cost of living support to those most vulnerable, worth an average £3,700 per household, and are raising benefits this April. “But we know work is the best way to financial security, which is why we are investing billions through our Back to Work Plan, expected to help over a million people into jobs, as well as extending our childcare offer while curbing inflation and cutting taxes so people get more of the money they earn.”"

Shame. Parading as a man of integrity, when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”\nSunak ignored several demands from MPs in the Commons that he apologise, saying only that Esther Ghey represented “the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity, and she deserves all our admiration and praise.”\nNo 10 defended his words, saying it was “legitimate” to note U-turns by the opposition.\nIt is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told that Ghey was watching, she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed that initial exchange.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBrianna, 16, was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered in February last year. Last Friday, Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were jailed for at least 22 and 20 years respectively. Ratcliffe was found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna’s transgender identity.\nIt emerged later that No 10 was trying to arrange a meeting between Sunak and Brianna’s family, at a time to suit them, to discuss online safety among young people, one of several issues that have come to the fore from her murder.\nWhile some colleagues leapt to Sunak’s defence – the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, tweeted that it was “shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief” – several Tory MPs expressed disquiet.\nThe former minister Jackie Doyle-Price said that while she was an advocate of balancing transgender rights with the protection of single-sex spaces, Sunak’s comment “trivialises something that’s very important” and was “frankly very ill-judged”.\nShe told Times Radio: “I suspect that when he says that line, he doesn’t think about it like that because it’s being given to him as a line. Let’s just bring it down to its lowest level – you know, boys like talking about penises.”\nDehenna Davison, another former minister, tweeted that it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense”, adding: “Our words in the house resonate right across our society and we all need to remember that.”\nShe wrote: “Given some of the terrible incidences of transphobia we have seen lately, this need for respect feels more crucial than ever.”\nJamie Wallis, the Conservative backbencher who in 2022 became the UK’s first publicly trans MP, also expressed disappointment at Sunak’s words.\nHe said in a statement: “I know that from my own interactions with the prime minister that today’s display of insensitivity must have been inadvertent. Today has been a tough day for me, but all I can think about right now is Brianna’s mother. Let us all think of her as we choose how to progress with this debate.”\nWhile Downing Street clearly hopes the row will die down, it has the potential to create more difficulties, with the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, enduring some awkward exchanges in TV interviews intended to be devoted to a Treasury analysis of Labour’s green prosperity plan.\nAsked repeatedly why Sunak had made a joke at the expense of trans people, the chancellor told the BBC this was “taking these comments out of context”, before eventually refusing to engage with questions about whether the prime minister should apologise.\nA Labour spokesperson said: “We don’t think that the country wants or deserves a prime minister that is happy to use minorities as a punchbag. The comments were really deeply offensive to trans people and he should reflect on his response there and apologise.”\nStarmer held a meeting with Esther Ghey in parliament after PMQs. He later tweeted: “I am utterly in awe of her strength and bravery in the face of such unimaginable grief, as she campaigns to make sure no parent has to go through what she did.”\nSunak and his ministers routinely attack Labour’s position on transgender rights. Last year the party changed its policy on a self-identification system that would have let people officially change their gender without a medical diagnosis."

        "content": "Keir Starmer will announce on Thursday that he is scaling back Labour’s £28bn green investment programme, in his biggest policy U-turn since becoming party leader. Senior Labour sources have told the Guardian that Starmer will finally confirm the party is no longer planning to spend £28bn a year on environmental schemes, given the economic uncertainty caused by the Conservative government. It follows weeks of uncertainty about the policy as competing factions within Starmer’s senior team pushed him to keep the pledge or ditch it. Starmer has insisted for several weeks that he still intended to meet the pledge, which was first made in 2021 as part of a promise that Labour would be the greenest government in history. But doing so has become far more difficult since it was made, given that the worsening fiscal outlook has left less room to borrow more without long-term debt levels going up. Some shadow ministers have urged Starmer for months to drop the target, arguing that it plays into Conservative attacks about Labour’s fiscal credibility. Others have warned that doing so will only accentuate the feeling among many voters that Starmer cannot be trusted to stick to his word. It is the latest in a series of major policy reversals since he became Labour leader, including dropping a promise to scrap university tuition fees and to impose higher rates of income tax on top earners. Recent media briefings by shadow ministers have led to speculation of a split between Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Reeves was asked repeatedly about the pledge in an interview with Sky News last week but failed to mention the £28bn on 10 separate occasions. Starmer on the other hand had used the figure as recently as this week, when he told Times Radio: “We want to have clean power by 2030 … That’s where the £28bn comes in, that investment that is desperately needed for that mission.” Labour sources said last week that the pledge was now “dead”, an assessment that was bolstered by comments from Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, that the target would now “move around”. Party officials have previously indicated they would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as previously announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company. The opposition also intends to spend up to £6bn a year on a home insulation scheme, although that also remains subject to the party’s most important fiscal rule – to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output by the end of the five-year period. The £6bn plan triggered a separate row on Wednesday after an official government analysis claimed it would actually cost double that. Labour said this was “nonsense”, saying it had never claimed all the money would come from central government. But some experts warned that even with the kind of private investment Labour says it can bring in, it will not be able to hit its target of insulating 19m homes in a decade. The row over the insulation scheme helped highlight the broader questions around the party’s overall green investment plans. In recent weeks, senior Conservatives have claimed that sticking to the £28bn figure would mean a probable tax rise. Those attacks have worried some around Starmer, including Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s director of campaigns, and Pat McFadden, the party’s campaigns coordinator. McSweeney recently warned shadow ministers about the possibility that Labour could slump in the polls in the final weeks before an election if the party makes promises it is not able to fully defend. While scaling back the green prosperity plan has been under consideration for some weeks, dropping the £28bn annual target, unveiled with great fanfare by Reeves at the Labour conference in 2021, is politically risky for Starmer and his team. Sunak accused Starmer on Wednesday of being a serial flip-flopper. In comments that were otherwise overshadowed by his controversial remarks about trans people, the prime minister said: “It is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on.”"

        "content": "In one sense this was Westminster discourse at its most depressingly normal, based on jibes about not knowing how to define a woman. But this time there was a difference: an onlooker who knows better than anyone how devastating the debate can be.\nIn the days since the sentencing last Friday of Brianna Ghey’s teenage killers, her mother, Esther, has been an incredibly dignified and thoughtful exemplar for debates on complex issues including social media use and transgender rights.\nJailing Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe for a minimum of 22 and 20 years respectively, the judge Mrs Justice Yip noted that their killing of Brianna was in part motivated by hostility towards the 16-year-old’s transgender identity.\n\n Related: Starmer condemns Sunak over trans rights jibe during PMQs visit by Brianna Ghey’s mother \n\nAll of a sudden, a political issue too often discussed in angry generalities could be seen through the prism of an actual person, and the most tragic of family stories.\nPeter Spooner, Brianna’s father, said it had been difficult at times to be the parent of a transgender child, but he had been forging a different relationship with a daughter he described as “a lovely young girl”.\nIn a deeply moving interview with BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Esther Ghey reiterated her compassion for the killers’ parents, saying she would be open to meeting Jenkinson’s mother to tell her she did not blame her. Watching the exchange in the same studio, Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, wiped away tears.\nAnd then Brianna’s mother watched Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions from the public gallery, joining her local Labour MP, Charlotte Nichols, before a planned meeting with Keir Starmer.\nGhey’s arrival was slightly delayed, and thus she missed Starmer announcing her presence. Then Rishi Sunak, who would have had no idea she was not yet there, launched into a clearly scripted attack on supposed Labour U-turns, one of which he said was “defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn”.\nSunak’s words about 99% of a U-turn referred to comments by Starmer last year that 99.9% of women “of course haven’t got a penis”, which while legally accurate – it remains possible to legally change one’s gender before gender reassignment surgery takes places – played into wider debates about the idea of self-identification for transgender people and the potential impact on single-sex women’s spaces.\nBeyond Starmer’s seemingly genuine anger about Sunak’s remark on Wednesday, and the row over whether Sunak should apologise, it seems clear that the simplified narrative is back, not least because it is one the Conservatives see as effective.\nSunak has become an increasingly enthusiastic participant in this battle. His deeply awkward manner when pledging to protect “our women” during stump speeches when he fought Liz Truss for the Conservative leadership left many assuming he was an unwilling culture warrior who said such words because they were expected.\nBut inside No 10, when faced by a political choice, Sunak has invariably taken the less socially liberal decision, and those around him confirm he is not pretending. As his speech to October’s Tory party conference put it, “a man is a man and a woman is a woman. That’s just common sense.”\nWas his willingness to plough on with such rhetoric in the presumed presence of Esther Ghey motivated by lack of concern or political clumsiness? Only Sunak knows. But when it comes to taunts about women and penises, as an election looms, we can expect much more of the same. "

        "content": "A Conservative MP has earned cross-party plaudits after speaking in parliament about his attempt to take his own life and encouraging others to seek help.\nElliot Colburn held back tears after standing up during prime minister’s questions and speaking of how “luckily” his attempt in 2021 failed and he was found by family members quickly.\nThe MP, who has represented Carshalton and Wallington since December 2019, began by reminding a packed House of Commons chamber that February is Boost Your Self-Esteem Month and Children’s Mental Health Month.\n“In recent years something like 6,500 people die in the UK each year due to suicide. In 2021 I was nearly one of them,” he said as a hush fell.\n“Luckily my attempt failed, I was found by family members quickly, I received amazing care at St Helier and Springfield hospitals, didn’t do any permanent damage and was well looked after by the NHS in the months that followed.\n“I want to take this chance to say thank you to everyone who saved me and sorry to my family and loved ones, who I put through such an awful ordeal. In that moment I felt alone and scared, and like there was no way out, and that the world would be better off without me in it.\n“I don’t recognise that man any more. I know that nothing is ever really worth that, help really is out there, and I am pretty awesome,” he added, his voice initially cracking before he smiled as other MPs shouted “hear, hear” to the last part.\nColburn went on to say: “Does the prime minister agree that one death by suicide is one too many? And will he send a message from the dispatch box today that whatever you are going through, you are not alone, that help is out there, and better days lie ahead?”\nThere was applause and murmurs of approval from Conservative and opposition MPs as Colburn sat down, and Rishi Sunak told him that the whole house would commend him.\nThe prime minister said a new prevention strategy would have actions in place to reduce suicide in the coming years. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, later crossed the floor of the chamber to speak with Colburn.\nColburn told the Guardian that he came back to work a few weeks after the attempt and had what he described as “the flexibility and support to get back on track”.\n“But I recognise not everyone is in that situation and it’s something that is still a bit of a taboo. I wasn’t really sure I wanted to speak about it until I did,” he added.\nHe said there was “a myriad” of things that led to the attempt. “I don’t think I can point to anyone though in particular. I was really nervous about talking to anyone and that certainly did not help, but it was telling how many people were ultimately there for me.”\nHe said: “I was just surrounded by amazing people and the NHS responded incredibly well, but obviously everyone’s experience is different and a lots of people don’t get the chance.”\nMPs who paid tribute to Colburn on social media included the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting. “This is incredibly courageous and has the potential to provide encouragement and hope to others who have been through, or are going through, the same ordeal,” Streeting said.\nIn 2022 there were 5,275 suicides in England, equivalent to 10.6 per 100,000 people, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nLast year ministers pledged to reverse the trend within two and a half years, as the government launched its first prevention strategy in more than a decade. \nA government document that accompanied the launch highlighted how rates of suicide among children and young people had increased in recent years, despite being low overall, adding: “Urgent attention is needed to address and reverse these trends.”\n• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Downing Street has rejected calls for an apology. And Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary and minister for women and equalities, has hit back, accusing Starmer of exploiting the Ghey tragedy for political gain. (See 3.25pm.)\n\n\nLabour’s pledge to insulate 19m homes in a decade has been thrown into doubt after the party confirmed it would not spend £6bn a year allocated for the scheme if its fiscal rules did not allow, while the government claimed it would cost twice that.\n\n\nRishi Sunak has been accused of making a U-turn on his pledge to restore NHS dentistry as experts say his “recovery plan” does not offer enough money to incentivise dentists to take on extra NHS patients.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.41pm GMT\n\n\n 5.32pm GMT \nHunt accepts that Tory/Treasury claim about Labour's insulation plan costing £13bn might not be realistic\n\nThis morning CCHQ put out a statement from Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, highlight a Treasury analysis of Labour’s plan to insulate 19m homes in a decade saying this would cost double the £bn a year claimed. “This official costing shows that a key plank of Labour’s policy costs double what they have claimed,” he said.\nBut the £13bn a year price tag attached to the policy by the Treasury and CCHQ has been dismissed by Labour (see 11.53am) and by experts (see 1.44pm), and now even Hunt does not seem quite so willing to defend the figure. \nWhen it was put to him by ITV’s Robert Peston in an interview that the £13bn figure was “implausible”, because it made assumptions such as full subsidies for wealthy families, Hunt replied: “Even if it’s not double the £6bn, it is still a very big chunk of a £28bn pound spending spree.”\n\n\n\n 5.15pm GMT \nTory MP Dehenna Davison says it was 'disappointing' to hear Sunak make joke about trans people\n\nThe Conservative MP Dehenna Davison has said it was “disappointing” to hear Rishi Sunak make a joke in the Commons today at the expense of trans peope.

Hunt said:\n\nWhat [Sunak] was saying is that for the really important issues of the day Labour and Sir Keir Starmer simply cannot make up his mind. He said when it comes to trans issues, economic issues, like £28bn a year, Labour changes its position by the day. His point was that if a political party that wants to govern this country can’t make up its mind on really important issues including how they would run the economy then they risk losing the progress we have made which would take us back to square one. \n\nWhen Mason put it to Hunt that Sunak “used a line about trans people as a political punchline in the presence of a grieving mother”, Hunt replied:\n\nChris, that is not what happened and you know that …What he was saying was that Keir Starmer cannot make up his mind up about the big issues of the day.\n\nDuring PMQs Sunak said: “I think I counted almost 30 [Starmer U-turns] in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.” This was a reference to an interview Starmer gave last year in which he said 99.9% of women did not have a penis.\nAt the time interviewers from some outlets were routinely asking Labour politicians if a woman could have a penis because often MPs like Starmer found it hard to give an answer acceptable to trans activists that did not attract derision from the right.\nTory politicians generally did not get asked the same question because they were happy to say no – even though technically that is the wrong answer because, as Starmer was alluding to, a gender recognition law that has been in force for 20 years does allow people to change gender without the need for surgery.\n\n\n\n 4.19pm GMT \nBadenoch's intervention in row about PM's anti-trans jibe - snap analysis\n\nKemi Badenoch comes top in surveys asking Conservative party members which cabinet ministers they admire the most, and she is currently favourite to be the next Tory leader. There are two reasons for this, both of which are perfectly illustrated by her intervention in the row about Rishi Sunak’s anti-trans jibe today. (See 3.25pm.)\nFirst, she has strong, rightwing views, particularly on matters of race and gender, that are in tune with what Tory members think, and she is not afraid to state them. Second, and more importantly, she relishes having a fight over them with her opponents. There is no one in the Conservative party who can bait the left with such audacity. The only possible exceptions might be Michael Gove and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, but they seem to care about politeness. Badenoch definitely doesn’t.\nWe’ve got a headline on the blog now about Badenoch’s intervention, but a more accurate one might be: “Badenoch sees fire, grabs can of petrol, and throws.” Despite her professed desire to “take the heat out of the debate on LGBT issues”, these are not comments intended to calm things down.\nThere are four other points worth making.\n1) Badenoch appears to be defending Sunak, without actually doing so. By trying to make this an argument about Keir Starmer’s comments, not Sunak’s, she is giving him some useful political cover. But she does not say he was right to make the joke he did, and her comments about the need for tact and understanding imply she would not have been so crass.\n2) Tory activists will like the claim that it is Labour that is weaponising the issue – even though it is not true. Starmer is not especially keen to talk about trans issues, and last year Labour tried to play down a U-turn on self-identification for people using the Gender Recognition Act. It is Tory politicians who are most exploiting this issue. Shortly before being appointed deputy Tory chair last year,, Lee Anderson said the party should fight the next election on a “mix of culture wars and trans debate”.\n3) And Badenoch’s opponents will also have a hollow laugh at the claim that she has sought to take the heat out of the debate on LGBT issues. She is seen as the minister responsible for the fact the government’s trans guidance for schools describes “gender identity ideology” as “a contested belief”. As Archie Bland wrote at the time, this “contradicts the settled position implied by the World Health Organization, the UK census, the law, the NHS, and the government itself”. Campaigners have claimed the guidance will “erase decades of progress in making schools places that value difference and reject discrimination”.\n4) But none of these objections are likely to stop interventions like this boosting Badenoch’s popularity with Tory activists. This afternoon, less than an hour after the tweets appeared, the bookmakers Coral sent out a press release saying it had “slashed the odds to 2-1 (from 7-2) on Kemi Badenoch becoming the next Conservative leader following support [ie new bets being placed on her] this afternoon”.\n\nUpdated at 4.29pm GMT\n\n\n 3.35pm GMT \nKeir Starmer pays tribute to Esther Ghey after they meet in Commons\n\nKeir Starmer has posted this on X about his meeting with Esther Ghey.

In a statement, it says dehumanising comments like this from people in power “can and do result in harm”.\n\n\nOur response to the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's comments during #PMQs today: pic.twitter.com/OU7gLzvme8— Stonewall (@stonewalluk) February 7, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.49pm GMT \n\nThe Scottish National party still holds a clear lead over Labour in both Westminster and Holyrood elections, according to a new poll by Ipsos which does, however, show those leads being steadily eroded.The Ipsos poll, for Scotland’s commercial broadcaster STV, puts the SNP seven points ahead in a Westminster election on 39%, versus 32% for Labour, and nine points in the constituency vote for Holyrood, on 39%. It said the SNP still maintains a lead in public trust in health, schools and the cost of living policies.\nHumza Yousaf’s advisers argue these findings undermine assumptions now taking root in Scotland that Labour is poised to beat the SNP in the general election, building on its drubbing of the SNP in last October’s Rutherglen byelection.Other polls put Labour much closer to the SNP in a Westminster vote. Panelbase very recently put Labour three points ahead, and Redfield & Wilton has had Labour two points ahead or neck and neck with the SNP.Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, believes those findings put Labour on or very close to 35% in general election voting. Labour sees that as the magic number, a tipping point at which a large number of SNP seats come into play for Labour.\nSome pollsters believe Ipsos’s methodology is more accurate than other commercial polls. YouGov, Panelbase, Survation and Redfield & Wilton tend to use internet-based panels of people registered and sometimes incentivised to take part. Ipsos cold calls voters by telephone and arguably has a wider and more representative net of people to draw from.However, today’s Ipsos data has warning bells for the SNP; it is tracking a continuing increase in Labour support. In May 2023, the SNP had a 12-point lead in a Westminster election, which fell to 10 points in November 2023. In the Holyrood vote, the SNP lead has fallen from 14 points last May, to 12 in November.The same squeeze appears in trust ratings; the SNP trust ratings on the NHS, schools and the economy have fallen by five or six points since May 2022 and Labour’s have grown by seven in all three areas.\n\n\n\n 1.44pm GMT \nTreasury costings of opposition policies have 'little, if any, credibility', says ex Treasury permanent secretary\n\nLabour has also described the Treasury costing document used by CCHQ to argue that Labour’s insulation policy would cost £13bn a year (see 11.53pm) as ludicrous and wrong.

(See 12.06pm.)\nAsked about the PM’s comment at the No 10 post-PMQs lobby briefing, a spokesperson said:\n\nIf you look back on what the prime minister was saying, there was a long list of U-turns that the leader of the opposition had been making.\nI don’t think those U-turns are a joke, it is quite serious changes in public policy.

If he is not trembling somewhere in the precincts of the Commons hoping the earth will swallow him up, he should be. According to Sam Coates on Sky News just now, Esther Ghey, Brianna’s mother, may not have arrived in the public gallery in time to hear Sunak’s anti-trans jibe (she may have arrived later, Coates say), but that is no consolation at all.\nFor all the complaints about PMQs being a ghastly shouting match, it is an environment where character gets tested and exposed – instantly, harshly, without recourse to advice – and today Sunak failed badly. He looked like someone whose empathy reflex is deficient.\nIt was also an insight into how, while the traditionalist, swaggering “a man is a man, a woman is a woman” stuff that Sunak favours may suit a Tory party conference, it does not fare so well when it collides with reality as experienced by people on the receiving end of anti-trans prejudice.\nAbove all, today’s exchanges were a reminder that PMQs is a challenge and that you can’t simply rely on what has been scripted in advance. Leaving aside the trans jibe, Sunak had a decent riff prepared about Keir Starmer’s numerous U-turns (see 12.06pm) and if he had had the nous, on hearing that Esther Ghey was in the gallery, to drop the punchline, he would have been OK. But he didn’t, because he hasn’t got the political agility, or the capacity to avoid the insensitive (the same instinct that might have protected him in his Piers Morgan interview).\nStarmer was able to rip up his script. Instantly spotting Sunak’s howler, he summed up the PM offence rather well:\n\nI think the role of the prime minister is to ensure that every single citizen in this country feels safe and respected. It’s a shame that the prime minister doesn’t share that.\n\nBackbenchers need to be able to improvise too. To her credit, Labour’s Liz Twist did this when she challenged Sunak to apologise to Ghey. But if she had just left it there, he would have had to answer. Instead she ploughed on his pre-prepared question, which allowed Sunak to ignore the point about an apology.\n\nUpdated at 2.59pm GMT\n\n\n 12.38pm GMT \n\nVicky Foxcroft (Lab) asks why the PM downgraded the role of minister for disabled people.\nSunak says the minister for disabled people (Mims Davies) will do a fantastic job, because she cares about the issue.\nThis is the last question, he he says he wants to address a point to Brianna Ghey’s mother. He says:\n\nI said earlier this week what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy. And, as I said earlier this week, in the face of that for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend, I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity, and she deserves all our admiration. \n\nHe does not apologise.\n\n\n\n 12.34pm GMT \n\nSarah Edwards (Lab) asks about a constituent waiting years for an autism diagnosis for her son.

The report says: We would note that the opposition has stated publicly that “public investment in home energy ramping up to £6 billion annual investment in the second half of the parliament at the latest”.\nA Labour source said:\n\nLabour’s plans to upgrade homes would ramp up to a maximum of £6bn per year, subject to our fiscal rules.\nThe government has the same target. It was first announced in 2017’s clean growth strategy and again in 2021’s heat and building strategy.\nGiven this is the government’s costings for delivering their own target, it raises questions about whether they have a secret plan to spend [£12-14bn] and how they will pay for it. \n\n\n\n\n 11.37am GMT \nDowden claims Sunak using interview to imply he thought Starmer was 'terrorist sympathiser' was 'acceptable'\n\nOliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, has claimed that Rishi Sunak was not being misleading when he suggested in an interview that Keir Starmer was a terrorist sympathiser.\nSunak made the comment in his TalkTV interview with Piers Morgan, which also led to him being widely condemned for shaking hands with Morgan on a £1,000 bet over whether or not deportation flights to Rwanda will happen.\nThe Conservatives have recently criticised Starmer for acting for the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir when he was a human rights lawyer in 2008. Starmer was part of a team of lawyers that tried unsuccessfully to use European human rights law to overturn a ban on the group in Germany.\nIn the interview Sunak told Morgan:\n\nWe have been very clear about Hizb ut-Tahrir, they should be a proscribed terrorist organisation. We are bringing forward the legislation to do that.\nAnd, again, the question for Keir Starmer, he once upon a time represented Hizb ut-Tahrir. Actually he supported them in resisting proscription elsewhere. And that is who he was on the side of? We are trying to ban these people and he was busy trying to represent them.\n\nAsked if he thought Starmer as “a terrorist sympathiser”, Sunak replied:\n\nWell I would say let the facts speak for themselves, right? There he was, he was their lawyer when they were trying to resist this.\n\nStarmer’s office dismissed Sunak’s comments as “desperate nonsense”, saying that as director of public prosecutions Starmer “oversaw the first ever prosecution of senior members of al-Qaida, the jailing of the airline liquid bomb plotters and the deportation of countless terrorists”.\nIn an interview with Times Radio, Dowden said that, while “robust political discourse” was fine, he did not think politicians should lie or mislead people, and he said he did not accept that was something his party was doing.\nAsked about Sunak’s jibe, Dowden said:\n\nWhat Rishi Sunak was highlighting … was the fact that [Starmer] had represented, I believe it was Hizb ut-Tahrir which the government has proscribed. I would say that is the use of robust language. I wouldn’t say that was the prime minister misleading.\n\nAsked if it was acceptable for Sunak to imply, in his response to Morgan, that he did think Starmer was a terrorist sympathiser, Dowden replied:\n\nI think it’s acceptable what the prime minister said, which was that the facts speak for themselves. He was setting out those facts for people to understand them.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.38am GMT\n\n\n 10.46am GMT \nAtkins criticised after refusing to confirm in TV interview budget for NHS dentistry has fallen\n\nDuring her media round this morning Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, faced awkward questions about funding for NHS dentistry.\nIn an interview on BBC Breakfast, she repeatedly refused to confirm that the budget for NHS dentistry has fallen over the past decade.\n\n\n'Has the budget for NHS dropped by £500 million sine 2014?'Health Secretary Victoria Atkins is questioned on #BBCBreakfast about funding for a new plan for dental care in Englandhttps://t.co/nQjndu2IS8 pic.twitter.com/EaEUs5FWTA— BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) February 7, 2024\n\n\nLater, on the Today programme, when asked to confirm that the government had underspent on dentistry, she said “the dentistry environment is much, much more complex than that”. She insisted that the £200m was new money, in addition to £3bn already being spent on NHS dentistry.\nAsked to confirm that overall spending on NHS dentisry in real terms was lower than it was in 2010, Atkins did not deny this, but said it was important to acknowledge there had been “a big change in the dental market over the last decade or so”.\nResponding to the interview round, Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem health spokesperson, said:\n\nSeeing a minister duck and dive on the reality of dental funding cuts will be hard to swallow for millions who have been left waiting for so long under this government.\nThe reality is they’ve left our dental services to rot and now think they can rebuild it with a handful of toothpicks.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.09am GMT\n\n\n 10.17am GMT \nSunak moving towards holding election in October, not later, report claims\n\nAt Westminster many people have been working on the assumption that the general election will take place in November or December. That is because one of the very few reliable laws of British politics is that a prime minister facing almost certain electoral defeat will put off an election for as long as possible, because January (the last possible date) would be madness, because no one wants an election campaign over Christmas, and because the Conservative party, like other parties, makes a huge amount of money from its party conference, and letting it go ahead would rule out October.\nBut, in a story in the Sun today, Harry Cole says thinking in No 10 is moving towards an October election. He explains:\n\nConcerns over massive global insecurity triggered by the potential return of Donald Trump means going to the country before the US election is now more likely, insiders say.\nIt comes as Tory HQ brought in a whopping £16.5 million in donations in the last four months.\nAn October poll would upend the party conference season - traditionally a big money spinner for political parties.\nBut one Tory source said: “Cash is not a problem for us.”\n\n\nUpdated at 1.52pm GMT\n\n\n 10.06am GMT \nStreeting says he would start reforming NHS dentists' contract within days of Labour taking office\n\nWes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, was giving interviews this morning about dentistry from outside the dental surgery in Bristol where the police had to be called to manage the queues because so many people wanted to sign up for an NHS dentists.\nUnusually for an opposition spokesperson, Streeting sounded marginally more positive about the government’s announcement than the relevant professional organisation – British Dental Association (see 9.46am). He said it would “go some way to plugging the immediate shortfall”. But he agreed with the BDA in saying what was really needed was reform of the contract for NHS dentists. Labour would address this within days of getting into office, he claimed.\nHe told BBC Breakfast this morning:\n\nIt’s just gone quarter past seven. There is already a queue of people. Those people have been told that the practice isn’t enrolling new patients today, but people are still queuing already on a very cold morning because they’re desperate.\nWhat the government’s announced today, much of which has been lifted from what Labour has announced as an emergency dental rescue package, will go some way to plugging the immediate shortfall.\nBut what it doesn’t do, and what the dentists are crying out for, is reform of the dentist contract so we can recruit and retain the NHS dentists we need.\nI will grip the issue of reform of the contract in week one of a Labour government, getting the dentists in straight away to agree the process for contract renegotiation.\n\n\n\n'People are queuing because they are desperate'As the Government announce a plan for dentists in England, Labour's Wes Streeting spoke to #BBCBreakfast from a dental practice in Bristol where people have been queuing for the last three days to registerhttps://t.co/nQjndu2IS8 pic.twitter.com/oqZ8U8qFgk— BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) February 7, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm GMT\n\n\n 9.46am GMT \n'Little more than rearranging the deck chairs' - why dental recovery plan has been savaged by British Dental Association\n\nThe British Dental Association cites numerous reasons why it thinks the government’s dental recovery plan for England is inadequate in its formal response. Here are the points it is making.\n\nThe BDA says the new, higher payments for dentists who see NHS patients do not “go anywhere near far enough” to covering the full costs dentists will incur, “particularly for treatments like dentures or crowns that require laboratory work”.\n\n\nIt says there is no new money for the new patient premium, and that NHS England is just “recycling the same limited pot of money”.\n\n\nIt says the £200m described as new money is “less than the half the underspends in the budget expected this year”.\n\n\nIt says the plan does not compensate for a decade of frozen budgets. It says:\n\n\nLast month Department of Health and Social care accounts revealed the service’s £3bn budget has barely changed in a decade, with no effort to keep pace with demand, or rising costs. In real terms the budget has been cut by over £1bn since 2010.\n\n\nThe BDA says the plan does not do what the Commons health committee said was needed in a report last year. The committee said the problems faced by people unable to access NHS dentistry were “totally unacceptable in the 21st century” and that “fundamental reform” of the contract for NHS dentists was needed.\n\n\nIt says, without reform to the contract for NHS dentists, the plan amounts to “little more than an exercise in ‘rearranging the deck chairs’”.\n\n\nIt says the proposal to extend water fluoridation is “close to meaningless” because of widening oral health inequality.\n\n\nIt says “frontloaded investment in tried-and-tested schemes like supervised brushing are needed now”. This is what Labour is proposing.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.47am GMT\n\n\n 9.10am GMT \nVictoria Atkins claims Labour does not trust parents to brush children’s teeth after criticism of Tory NHS dental plan\n\nGood morning. Labour has been campaigning hard recently on the dire state of NHS dentistry, which is near-impossible to access to many places, and today the government is responding by publicising its own NHS dental recovery plan. The British Dental Association has been scathing about it. It is normal, with a government initiative like this, for the relevant to professional body to say that it is a step in the right direction but does not go far enough etc. But, in its response, the BDA does not even bother with the usual niceties. It is wholly critical, saying the plan is “incapable of even beginning to honour Rishi Sunak’s promise to ‘restore’ NHS dentistry, or in any way meet the government’s stated ambition to provide access to NHS dentistry for ‘all who need it’”.\nAletha Adu and Tobi Thomas have the story here.\n\n Related: NHS dentistry ‘recovery plan’ not worthy of the title, dentists say \n\nLabour has said some elements of the programme, in particular the emphasis on doing more to get young children brushing their teeth properly, echoes what they were saying in their own dental recovery plan, published in October at the party conference. In interviews this morning, Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, refused to accept that, claiming that Labour does not trust parents. She told Times Radio:\n\nLabour seems to think that no parent can be trusted to brush their children’s teeth. We do not take that approach. We say the overwhelming majority of parents do a great job looking after their children. \nFor those children that are struggling, this is where the fluoride brushing dental teams into reception class...really counts because we are targeting it very, very particularly on areas where there are high, high rates of oral ill health.\n\nBut, in fact, on children’s teeth brushing, the two plans are similar. NHS England’s plan says:\n\nThe plan will also see the government roll out a new ‘Smile For Life’ programme which will see parents and parents-to-be offered advice for baby gums and milk teeth, with the aim that by the time children go to school, every child will see tooth brushing as a normal part of their day.\n\nAnd Labour proposed: “Supervised toothbrushing in schools for 3-5 year olds, targeted at the areas with highest childhood tooth decay.” \nAt the time Labour announced this, some Tories criticised the party for nanny statism. Miriam Cates, the co-chair of the New Conservatives, a backbench group of rightwingers who are particularly socially conservative and pro-family, suggested Labour was “disempowering parents and robbing them of their rightful responsibilities”.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\nNoon: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\nAfter 12.45pm: MPs debate motions relating to funding for the police and local government.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "It’s not hard to count the things that are out of Rishi Sunak’s control. He can’t really help being less popular than everyone in the Tory party except for Liz Truss. It’s not really his fault that the economy is barely out of recession. Covid, Brexit and Radon Liz (her again) have seen to that. Nor is he wholly to blame for the NHS being on its knees. Though blocking attempts to end the doctors’ strike haven’t helped. And it’s not on him that, almost to a man and a woman, his Tory MPs are inadequate. It’s a wretched time for the Conservative gene pool. But these days, Sunak can’t even control the things within his agency. He is a man almost entirely without political instincts; a piece of unwanted flotsam being tossed carelessly from side to side. Time and again his character is exposed and he is found wanting. Decades of inhabiting a gilded cage have turned him into an ingenu. Someone unable to deal with the real world. Unable to respond as a human to other people’s lives – or, indeed, their tragedies. He is all at sea. His wiring is all wrong, unusable even in a faulty 1980s computer. What he is even doing in No 10 is something exercising the minds of almost every Tory MP, many of whom are actively trying to remove him. The rest have merely decided it would look even worse to get rid of him. So Rishi gets to stay. The interim prime minister. Loved and admired by no one. Not even his cabinet colleagues. Especially his cabinet colleagues. They are the ones who get to see his shortcomings close up. The ones whose ambitions and careers are sacrificed on his altar. Whether this can last till the next election is touch and go. Because, the more we get to see of Sunak’s character, the less there is to like. And at Wednesday’s PMQs, we may just have scraped the barrel. Keir Starmer began the session by welcoming Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna, to the public gallery. Esther wasn’t actually in her seat just yet, but she soon would be, as a guest of her local Warrington MP, Charlotte Nichols. The Labour leader spoke of his admiration for Ghey. The dignity with which she had conducted herself throughout her suffering. The generosity of her compassion for the families of her daughter’s killers. All of this just bypassed Sunak. He wasn’t bothered. Not even enough to go through the motions of offering his own condolence. There was nothing in Brianna’s murder for him. No political advantage to be gained. So why should he be bothered? That was last week’s story. Esther Ghey should just get on with her life and leave him to get on with running the country. Watch and learn, Esther. You might even pick up a few tips.   People like him don’t go round apologising to working-class women from Warrington. She wasn’t even a millionaire.   So Sunak merely indulged in an unedifying game of political banter, one he was always going to lose anyway as his hand is so rubbish. Name us one thing that’s going well, Rishi? Oh? You can’t. But that didn’t stop Rish!. Bizarrely, he actually thinks he is good at this game. That he is a natural born winner. That he can bluff his way out of any situation. The Man with the Golden Voice. “The Labour leader has broken every promise,” he sneered. The insistent, entitled nasal whine getting ever more high-pitched and needy. Sunak, though, was to show himself as a man of no promise. No integrity. He said Starmer couldn’t even define a woman. It was as if he was expecting a roar of approval from his own side. Which he got from his own frontbench. The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, roared with laughter, slapping her thigh. It seems there’s nothing she likes more than an anti-trans joke. If she had any self-respect, she wouldn’t show her face in public for weeks. Starmer was understandably outraged. On this, of all days. Was it really the time to be making transphobic gags? When the mother of a murdered trans teenager was in the chamber. He offered Sunak the chance to apologise. But Rish! knew no shame. Saw no reason to say sorry. People like him don’t go round apologising to working-class women from Warrington. She wasn’t even a millionaire. Hell, Ghey should be the one showing gratitude to him. After all he had done. Seldom, if ever, can a prime minister have made quite such a spectacle of himself during PMQs. Weirdly, it’s not even as if Sunak is personally much of a transphobe. He’s almost certainly never given the issue much thought. It’s just that he’s pathetically needy for the approval of all the culture war Tories on the far right. Craven even.   Rish! had no reply. He had been shown up. The Emperor with No Clothes.   He will do and say anything to get their attention. To win a few cheap laughs. Join the attacks on minorities. Blame the elites. I guess Goldman Sachs doesn’t count. Because at heart, Rish! has no convictions beyond his own short-term survival. Nothing in which he believes. He is, as Tony Blair said of John Major, “Weak, weak, weak.” The Labour MP Liz Twist later gave Sunak another chance to apologise. To even acknowledge Ghey’s presence. Starmer pointed up to the gallery. But Sunak still couldn’t bring himself to do it. Couldn’t admit that he had made a mistake. At heart, he has the mind of a child. Unable to do the right thing. He thinks he’s being tough when everyone else sees frailty. A Man of No Quality. Finally, after one of his advisers had got a message to him that even his own team thought he looked shit, Sunak mumbled a quick non-apology right at the end of the session. Too little, too late. This wasn’t the first time Sunak’s character defects had been shown up this week. There was also the £1,000 bet with Piers Morgan over the deportation of refugees. Because having a punt over other people’s suffering is what you would expect of any prime minister. Why not make a £1,000 bet on when Brianna’s killers get out? Rish! has tried to laugh off the bet. To make out that he had been bullied into it by Morgan. That he couldn’t wriggle out of it. Except he could have done. No one has to do whatever a narcissist tells you to do in the course of an interview. You don’t have to kneel before whatever a fool with a massive ego and little else tells you to do. Try it. Morgan is surprisingly thin-skinned. He can’t take criticism. Sunak could try calling him out. And Morgan’s boss, Rupert Murdoch. Except Sunak couldn’t. He was bound to make the bet. Because that’s who he is. So, naturally enough, Starmer also played on that weakness at PMQs. Rish! had no reply. He had been shown up. The Emperor with No Clothes. This is who he is. Time for a darkened room. How much longer can this go on?"

        "content": "Labour’s pledge to insulate 19m homes in a decade has been thrown into doubt after the party confirmed it would not spend £6bn a year allocated for the scheme if its fiscal rules did not allow, while the government claimed it would cost twice that. Labour officials confirmed on Wednesday the party would not spend the full £6bn previously promised for home insulation until later in the parliament, and might not at all if it were to result in rising levels of government debt. The comments came after a government analysis said fully funding the scheme would cost between £12bn and £15bn a year. Those figures were called into doubt by Labour, which says it will also use private sector levies and incentives to help fund the scheme. They were also partly disowned by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who admitted in an interview Labour’s scheme might not cost as much as £12bn. However the lack of detail in Labour’s proposal is another example of how uncertainty around its overall £28bn-a-year green plan continues to plague the opposition party. Party sources say the spending target is effectively “dead” given the constraints already placed on it and are urging Starmer to say so publicly, but the Labour leader continues to use and defend it in public. A Labour spokesperson said on Wednesday: “[Our] policy is to ramp up to £6bn, in line with our fiscal rules.” The party has previously said the target would be hit “in the second half of the parliament at the earliest”. Some senior members of the party believe Labour could spend almost nothing on the scheme in the first year, given it would take time to hire and train the number of specialists required to carry out the scheme. The Conservatives, however, called into question whether Labour’s spending commitments would be enough to hit its ambitious green targets. An analysis by civil servants in the energy department but commissioned by Tory ministers showed on Wednesday that even hitting a more modest target of insulating 16m homes would cost at least £12bn a year. Some experts criticised the government for publishing the analysis as an official document, given its assumptions do not tally with official Labour policy. Nick Macpherson, the former lead civil servant at the Treasury, tweeted: “Over the next 9 months, we will have to tolerate many an ‘official Treasury’ costing of Opposition policy. Since time immemorial, whatever the party in power, these costings have had little if any credibility. Political advisers determine the assumptions. #rubbishinrubbishout.” Labour, meanwhile, called the analysis “nonsense”, given that it has committed to spending a lower amount, and added that it would find ways to fund the scheme other than simply through central government spending. A Labour spokesperson said: “Previous policy design has differentiated funding levels by household income and has balanced the cost of policies between exchequer-funded schemes/grants, and supplier obligations … all of which could considerably reduce the burden on the exchequer from delivering this policy.” Another added that the target would be funded with “a mixture of loans and grants”. One way to pay for the scheme would be to increase the levies on energy suppliers through schemes such as the energy company obligation and the Great British insulation scheme. Critics, however, point out that doing so would be likely to push up customers’ bills. Another path would be to incentivise banks to offer cheaper mortgages to those who retrofit their houses with insulation. Labour officials are working on the details of schemes such as the warm homes programme in time for the manifesto launch later this year, with shadow ministers working towards a deadline of this Friday for submitting headline measures. But with uncertainty still plaguing much of the party’s green agenda, the Conservatives are continuing to attack Starmer’s party, alleging they are planning to use secret tax rises to pay for it. Rishi Sunak said in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday: “It is now crystal clear they have absolutely no plan. We all know how they are going to fund that gap: more taxes on hard-working people.”"

        "content": "Keir Starmer has angrily confronted Rishi Sunak in the Commons as the prime minister derided Labour’s policy on transgender rights after being told that the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery.\nStarmer began his first question of PMQs by saying Esther Ghey was watching the session. He was scheduled to meet her afterwards.\n“This week, the unwavering bravery of Brianna Ghey’s mother, Esther, has touched us all. As a father I can’t even imagine the pain that she’s going through. And I’m glad that she’s with us in the gallery here today,” Starmer said.\nLater, responding to a question from Starmer on the government’s failure to cut hospital waiting lists, Sunak said: “It’s a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who’s broken every single promise he was elected on.\n“I think I counted almost 30 in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn. The list goes on but the theme is the same. It’s empty words, broken promises and absolutely no plan.”\nStarmer has previously said “99.9%” of women do not have penises, though Downing Street was unable to say whether this was what Sunak had been referring to.\nAn evidently angry Starmer replied: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in the chamber. Shame. Parading as a man of integrity. When he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”\nSunak ignored this in his next reply. When asked later in the session by Labour’s Liz Twist to apologise to Brianna’s mother, he ignored the question, despite shouts of “apologise” from the opposition benches.\nAt the end of PMQs, Sunak praised Esther Ghey, saying she represented “the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity, and she deserves all our admiration and praise”. He did not apologise, however.\nIt is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told Ghey was watching, she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed the initial exchange.\nDowning Street afterward said the prime minister stood by what he said in the chamber. Sunak’s press secretary said: “It is legitimate in the house to be able point out the changes in position the leader of the opposition has made.”\nAsked if the prime minister thought it was acceptable to use trans people as the punchline to a joke, the press secretary said: “I don’t accept that characterisation.”\nA Labour spokesperson said: “We don’t think that the country wants or deserves a prime minister that is happy to use minorities as a punch bag. The comments were really deeply offensive to trans people, and he should reflect on his response there and apologise.”\nSunak and his ministers routinely attack Labour’s position on transgender rights. Last year the party changed its policy on a self-identification system that would let people officially change their gender without a medical diagnosis.\nLast Friday, Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were sentenced for murdering 16-year-old Brianna after luring her to a park in Cheshire in February 2023. Ratcliffe was found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna’s transgender identity.\nSince the sentencing, when the killers were identified for the first time, Esther Ghey has called for “empathy and compassion” towards their families, as “they too have lost a child” and “must live the rest of their lives knowing what their child has done”.\nJenkinson’s family thanked Brianna’s mother for her “incredible selflessness and empathy towards our family”."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of making a U-turn on his pledge to restore NHS dentistry as experts say his “recovery plan” does not offer enough money to incentivise dentists to take on extra NHS patients. The prime minister’s long-awaited proposals have been criticised for failing to ringfence funding for the dental sector and reform the NHS dentistry contract, which means millions across the country will continue to struggle to access care. The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, repeatedly dodged questions on whether the plan was being funded by an underspend in the NHS dentistry budget and if the current budget was far lower than it was 10 years ago. Sunak’s plan, described as the means to “put NHS dentistry on a sustainable footing”, comes after police were called to manage a queue of hundreds of people outside a reopened dental practice in Bristol on Monday. Under the plan, NHS dentists will be given a “new patient” payment of between £15 and £50, depending on the treatment needed, to help care for 1 million new patients who have not seen a dentist in two years or more. The British Dental Association (BDA) has said the £200m pledged by the government is less than half of the underspends in the budget expected this year, leaving no new money for the promised new patient premium. Labour’s health spokesperson, Wes Streeting, claimed there was a £400m underspend in the NHS dentistry budget last year. Atkins told BBC’s Breakfast programme the plan was backed by “an additional £200m”. “The budget is £3bn,” she added. “We are spending more on the NHS than we ever have.” Dr Simon Chard, the former president of British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, told Sky News the current dental contract was “pushing” dentists out of the NHS to work in the private sector. Despite these warnings, Atkins told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme she “can’t possibly” guarantee that dentists who took on NHS patients would fully get their money back for all the work the patient got done, even as part of the new incentive package. The government accidentally sent details of the scheme to all MPs on Tuesday afternoon, which included the plan to offer NHS dentists cash incentives to take on extra patients and a new scheme to send dental teams to schools and nurseries to tackle tooth decay. Sunak was praised for offering parents and parents-to-be advice on how to take care of babies’ gums and milk teeth as part of the Smile for Life programme. Dental vans will be deployed in rural and coastal areas to reach the most isolated communities. But Shawn Charlwood, the chair of the BDA’s general dental practice committee, said: “This ‘recovery plan’ is not worthy of the title. It won’t halt the exodus from the workforce or offer hope to millions struggling to access care. Nothing here meets government’s stated ambitions, or makes this service fit for the future. “Ministers wanted to stop dentistry becoming an election issue. By rearranging the deckchairs they’ve achieved the exact opposite. The crisis will remain a burning issue in communities across this country until we get real change.” Labour accused the government of stealing its dentist recruitment plans and proposals on supervised toothbrushing that were rubbished by a number of Conservative MPs earlier this year.  The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “After 14 years of Conservative neglect, patients are desperately queueing around the block to see a dentist, literally pulling their own teeth out, and tooth decay is the No 1 reason for six- to 10-year-olds being admitted to hospital. “The Conservatives are only promising to do something about it now there’s an election coming. By adopting Labour’s proposals for recruitment and supervised toothbrushing, they are finally admitting that they are out of ideas of their own. “It will be left to the next Labour government to rescue NHS dentistry and get patients seen on time once again.” According to the BDA, 23,577 dentists carried out NHS work in the 2022-23 financial year, the lowest number since 2012-13 and a reduction of 1,100 dentists compared with pre-Covid levels. Four in five dentists in England are not taking on new NHS patients and, according to analysis by the Labour party, 71.1%, are not accepting children. The BDA has said the £3bn dental budget has remained static for a decade and has not accounted for inflation and rising demand. It says the budget has been cut in real terms by more than £1bn since 2010. "

        "content": "A £400m office complex nicknamed “the Slab” has been given the go-ahead to replace ITV’s former headquarters on London’s South Bank despite fierce opposition from green campaigners and modernist architecture fans. Opponents said the proposals of  the 72 Upper Ground scheme would generate more carbon emissions in its construction than if the 4,000 office workers it is designed to house were to drive in from Surrey for 30 years. The former communities secretary, Greg Clark, called for an inquiry into the development in 2022 despite the planning committee of the London borough of Lambeth giving the development the go-ahead with approval backed by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. Demolition of the current building was paused in April 2022 by the housing secretary, Michael Gove, while ministers considered whether to call in the application. The inquiry came hot on the heels of a probe into Marks & Spencer’s plans to raze and redevelop its Marble Arch store on London’s Oxford Street, which Gove blocked – partly on the basis of the carbon impact of redevelopment. M&S is taking legal action against the decision.   Related: Will this brute of a building herald a new assault on London’s skyline? | Rowan Moore   The Twentieth Century Society, which campaigns for the protection of modern buildings such as the nearby National Theatre and IBM building, both designed by architect Denys Lasdun, said the move to approve 72 Upper Ground “gives the go-ahead to a universally derided development”. The society said the scheme would “cause irreversible damage to the unique setting, heritage and dynamism of London’s South Bank. It will overshadow the most important collection of modernist buildings in the country, and sets a dangerous precedent for overdevelopment in sensitive sites. Once again, the Thames has been sold down the river.” Gove said he had approved the development given the “the employment generating opportunities” for the local area in both the construction and operation of the building as well as the “placemaking benefits” including the provision of “affordable creative workspace”. While Gove said he did not believe the development would be attractive and “the proposal would not provide a positive contribution to the townscape of the South Bank”, he suggested the harm to designated heritage assets including the National Theatre, the IBM building, Somerset House and the South Bank conservation area would be “less than substantial”. Shinichi Kagitomi, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Estate London and Stephen Black, the director at the developers CO—RE, welcomed approval of what they called “transformational plans” for the South Bank. The cost of the building contract is £400m but the company said its total investment in the project was £700m. The developers have said the scheme, which includes a 26-storey tower linked to a 13-storey block, was designed to “the highest standards in terms of sustainability” and that it was difficult to reuse the existing building for office space. They said: “72 Upper Ground represents a £700m investment in the UK, creating over 4,000 new jobs, and vital new workspace that prioritises sustainability and wellbeing. Crucially, it will benefit the local community through the London Studios, which will provide 40,000 sq ft net of affordable workspace that is tailored to the needs of Lambeth’s emerging creative industries. “This includes new cultural venues that have rehearsal space, gallery and presentation spaces and studios, alongside new public spaces with river facing cafes and restaurants.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of personally holding up a deal to end doctors’ strikes in England despite warnings from the health department and NHS England that waiting lists will continue to soar unless the industrial dispute is resolved. Sources told the Guardian it had been made “abundantly and repeatedly” clear to the prime minister that there would be no progress on his pledge to drive down NHS waiting lists until a deal was struck. One official said Sunak had been a “blocker” to progress during talks with both consultants and junior doctors at the end of last year because of concerns that a more generous offer would result in calls for higher pay deals across the health service, in particular for nurses. Junior doctors staged a series of strikes after talks between the British Medical Association and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) broke down, with the doctors’ union saying the government had not been able to put forward a credible offer. Consultants, meanwhile, rejected the latest pay offer from the government by a narrow margin last month, urging ministers to improve the deal on offer. Talks between the BMA and junior ministers are continuing.   Related: ‘Nobody wants to be here’: cheers and sadness on junior doctors’ picket line   Sources told the Guardian that Sunak was warned the government would not meet waiting list targets during almost every meeting he held with NHS England and the DHSC. Downing Street aides were also told at their own meetings with health officials. Papers marked “official sensitive” that were sent to No 10, and have been seen by the Guardian, cautioned in bold text that “in all scenarios if industrial action continues waiting lists will not fall”. Sunak acknowledged on Monday that he had failed to keep his promise of cutting waiting lists, one of five key commitments he made when taking office and on which he said his own competence would be judged. The situation in England has actually worsened. “We have not made enough progress,” he said when asked about his pledge during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, he replied: “Yes, we have.” He later appeared to blame NHS strikes for the situation. One source suggested that Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, had been “reined in” by Downing Street, after initially indicating she was prepared to meet for further talks and had not yet made the government’s final offer. However, DHSC insiders said Atkins had only offered further talks if the strikes were called off first, adding that both disputes went beyond pay settlements to wider issues, including working conditions. Whitehall sources said Steve Barclay, who was the health secretary until he moved post in the November reshuffle, pushed Sunak to settle the dispute, but was not given the autonomy to do so himself. One senior NHS source said Atkins was being hampered by No 10 in her efforts to end the separate, but overlapping, consultants and junior doctors disputes. “NHS England have been making it clear to the government the extent to which strikes are severely hampering efforts to get the waiting list down,” the source said. “The Department of Health and Social Care knows that the PM’s pledge won’t be met unless the strikes come to an end. And while there have been some minor improvements with waiting lists, it will be impossible to make up the ground [while walkouts continue]. “It’s clear from the stop-go nature of the talks between the DHSC and BMA that the secretary of state doesn’t have a free hand to negotiate.” A second well-placed NHS source said: “NHS leaders are very clear that the delivery of [Sunak’s] pledge on the elective target would be impossible without solving the strikes. “NHS England and the Department of Health have both been arguing that if you want to meet the elective target, it will be very, very, very difficult to do that without settling the strikes by doctors. “NHS England’s leadership believes that the junior doctors’ strikes and the elective target are clearly intimately related to each other.” More than 1.3m NHS appointments in England have been rescheduled because of industrial action, according to the DHSC. Sunak has sought to blame them for the huge waiting list, which stood at 7.6m in November but fell by 96,000 that month, when there was no strikes. Unions have consistently said ministers could avoid strikes by offering better pay deals and have denied being responsible for the waiting list, pointing out it went up by nearly 5m between 2010 and 2022, when there was no industrial action to blame. Prof Phil Banfield, the chair of the BMA council, said: “Doctors are already working above and beyond. If the prime minister just allowed his health secretary to make credible pay offers instead of perpetually stalling, doctors would be free to get back to bringing waiting lists down. He cannot abdicate responsibility any longer.” Government insiders said Sunak believed every pound of taxpayers’ money should be spent carefully so he was reluctant to sign off a more generous settlement. Others said this was a false economy as the bill for NHS staffing to cover the strikes hit £2bn in early December, and is expected to rise to £3bn, more than the sum required to settle the dispute. A DHSC source said the prime minister had not personally blocked a deal, however Downing Street did not deny the claims. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Junior doctors have been given a fair pay increase averaging 8.8%. On top of that pay increase, we have also offered further investment for junior doctors during the latest negotiations. “If they come back to the table with reasonable expectations then we remain hopeful of finding a way forward. We want everyone to focus on patients and cutting waiting times for them, and urge the BMA to work with us in the interests of patients.” • This article was amended on 8 February 2024 to include reference to a DHSC source saying the prime minister had not personally blocked a deal. This was received after publication."

        "content": "Liz Truss is my guilty pleasure. A very expensive one at that. She added thousands to most people’s mortgages in the blink of an eye. But a pleasure nonetheless. Politicians like Liz don’t come round that often. Once in a generation. If that. So we ought to savour her when we can. What Radon Liz – she’s a gas, but she’s inert – lacks in ability she more than compensates for in self-belief. Where she gets this confidence from, no one knows. It’s not even clear if she’s technically alive. Attach an EEG to either side of her head and you will only intermittently pick up a signal. The woman who is suspicious of the deep state is in one herself. Only hers is unconsciousness. So much so that she’s become a museum piece. Rightwing thinktanks in the US pay thousands to watch her say nothing. Ordinarily these qualities might prove a hindrance to a career in frontline politics, but the modern day Conservative party is woke enough to embrace difference. So Liz has effortlessly gone from the environment secretary who rambled about cheese at the Tory party conference to becoming prime minister for five minutes or so. Some might have thought that was enough. She’d had a good run for her money. Time to call it quits. But that’s not Radon Liz’s style. Not for her a life on the sidelines. The world has not yet had enough Liz. Just give her a chance and there’s so much more damage she’d like to do. She had barely started. Just remember to switch her on and point her in the direction of a TV camera.   We were at a time of maximum peril. There were unelected wrecking-balls everywhere you looked. Including in the mirror   No matter that in a recent poll Truss came out as by far the least popular Tory politician, with a favourability rating of -54%. To put that in perspective, Rishi Sunak only scores at -27% and people really don’t like him. But Liz just sees this as a challenge. In her mind, all that’s wrong is that people haven’t had enough time to really get to know her. The idea that people might have already seen too much hasn’t registered. Self-awareness is not her strong point. So when it was announced that Truss would be the star attraction of the latest Tory splinter group, Popular Conservatism, it was as if all my dreams had come true. Liz was back and the world was a more joyous place. More unstable, for certain, but we can live with that. And the sheer brilliance of calling yourself Popular. You can’t buy that kind of branding. Just wait till we see who is in the Unpopular Conservatism. But there was trouble even before the start. Simon Clarke was kicked out for actively trying to remove Rishi. The rules of association state you have to pretend to want Sunak while campaigning to get rid of him. Then the totally unremarkable Ranil Jayawardena, who Truss had briefly elevated to her cabinet, decided he would rather remain anonymous. And Kwasi Kwarteng chose the morning of the PopCon launch to announce he was standing down as an MP at the next election. So he’s no longer a believer. Looks like the PopCons are splintering already. Take your pick which are the Officials and which are the Provisionals. Still, it was standing room only at the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster long before the launch event began. Plenty of Tory MPs were there. Priti Patel, Brendan Clarke-Smith, Jake Berry and Wendy Morton among them. Stick with the winners. This is the future of the Conservative party. Then there was Lord Frost. Yet to be right about anything. His presence must have planted some self-doubt in all the others. And loitering at the back, the ever more reptilian Nigel Farage. Trying to work out how best to play the odds for his own advantage. There was a brief silence and then the big names trooped down the aisle to the front. Like an arranged wedding party. The former Institute of Economic Affairs boss and director of the PopCons, Mark Littlewood, kicked things off. “We are Popular Conservatavism,” he said. He repeated it, in case people hadn’t been paying attention. “We are Popular Conservatavism.” You can’t buy that comic timing. Pure slapstick. The man who doesn’t even know what his own organisation is called. Then we were into the world of a Dan Brown thriller. The country had been taken over by a shadowy group of Commie Illuminati. Literally. Every part of life, from the government, the markets to the judiciary had been seized by leftwing extremists. Like the head of the IMF.   Related: Listen up! It’s Liz Truss and the PopCons, the Tory tribute act sounding a death knell for irony | Marina Hyde   He couldn’t explain how it was that a Tory government had spent 14 years watching all this take place with no one noticing. Nor could he say how it was that many of those Tory MPs in this very room had trousered £85k in payouts from the shadowy elite. Perhaps they were all duped. Still he said he was in favour of free speech, so he will love this. Next up was Jacob Rees-Mogg. Now just reduced to a tired end of the pier show. He has become the bore’s bore. A third-rate pastiche of himself. Nothing he has ever predicted has come true. So he moaned about the judges and the EU. Hopefully Nanny will one day tell him to take responsibility for the mess he has created. Then Mhairi Fraser, an unknown Tory candidate who faces oblivion at the general election, had a whinge about being told to stop smoking and eating sweets. Bizarrely, she thought she was connecting with the country. Then Lee Anderson. Full-time GB News presenter and part-time MP. He didn’t mention how he had campaigned for Jeremy Corbyn in 2017. Rather he complained about every environmental initiative while saying he quite liked the idea of clean air. Hypocrite or halfwit? You decide. He kept insisting that the British people weren’t stupid but then proceeded to talk as if they were. Finally the person we had all come to see. The Trusster. “I don’t get invited to dinner parties much any more,” she said coyly. Well, you can come to our house in Tooting any time. We’ll have such a laugh. Her actual speech was more a semi-coherent ramble. More shadowy lefties everywhere you looked. The only people you could trust were in this room. Perhaps not even all of them, though. We were at a time of maximum peril. There were unelected wrecking-balls everywhere you looked. Including in the mirror. No one remembers voting for Liz. Hysterically, she ended by asking for democratic accountability. And that was it. Time to go. No one could quite work out what it had all meant. Some vague ideas to help Rishi lose the election? A marker for a leadership bid after the election by which time most of the MPs in the room will be looking for new jobs? Or just a last hurrah for Liz? Because she and we can’t bear to part from one another. Not yet. The last hurrah of Westminster’s Norma Desmond. “I’m ready for my close-up, Mr De Mille.” Unleash the smile. Feel the love. We need to treasure her while we can."

        "content": "  5.30pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Liz Truss, the former PM, and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, have committed themselves to an unadulterated form of rightwing, anti-establishment populism at the launch of a new group, Popular Conservatism. In speeches at the launch, Truss claimed British institutions were riddled with “wokeism”, while Rees-Mogg named the ECHR, World Health Organization and Cop as he attacked “international cabals and quangos telling hundreds of millions of people how to lead their lives”. (See 12.18pm and 12.29pm.) It is not clear how much public support there is for this agenda, but it is likely to be popular with the party members who will choose the next leader. However, it is quite different from traditional Conservatism, as William Hague, a former party leader, made clear in his Times column today. Identifying five “rules” needed for Tory success, he said:   A second rule is to mobilise elites and the wider nation in partnership, not turn one against the other. There is no case in history of conservatives being popular while attacking the country’s institutions, or its business community. So many aspects of government in Britain need kick-starting, or speeding up, or new expertise, or more accountability, but Churchill or Thatcher picked the people to do that and made the system work for them. Paranoia about “anti-growth coalitions” is for the populists. Popular conservatives have always learnt from expert advice, while running governments with high standards of conduct and integrity.   Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has described the government’s dental recovery plan as “remarkably similar to Labour’s”. He was responding to a BBC report saying the plan involves dentists cash incentives to take on NHS patients and send teams to schools to treat children’s teeth. According to the BBC, the government plan was due to be published tomorrow, but was inadvertently emailed to MPs. Earlier, in response to a story about hundreds of people queuing outside a dental surgery in Bristol because it was willing to see NHS patients, Labour used the incident as an opportunity to deploy a famous Conservative election poster image against the party.   Yesterday, hundreds of people desperate for an NHS dentist appointment queued for hours when a new practice opened in Bristol.After 14 years of Tory decline, this is the Britain we live in today. It's time for change. pic.twitter.com/GQAIRUosCA— The Labour Party (@UKLabour) February 6, 2024   Labour has a fully funded plan to rescue NHS dentistry with 700,000 emergency appointments and new dentists where they're needed the most.— The Labour Party (@UKLabour) February 6, 2024   Keir Starmer has said Labour’s policy pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment is “desperately needed,” as he re-opened an issue that has become a source of tension in the party.   Rishi Sunak has rowed back on a £1,000 bet with the broadcaster Piers Morgan on whether deportation flights to Rwanda would take off before the general election, saying he was “not a betting person”.   Kwasi Kwarteng, the former chancellor who oversaw the ill-fated “mini-budget” under the short-lived government of Liz Truss, has said he will not stand again as an MP at the next election.   Updated at 5.35pm GMT    4.58pm GMT   According to a snap poll by YouGov, almost three quarters of people (72%) think it was unacceptable for Rishi Sunak to accept a £1,000 bet on the success of his Rwanda policy. Only 14% of people think that was acceptable, the poll suggests.  72% of Britons say it was unacceptable for Rishi Sunak to accept Piers Morgan's £1,000 bet on whether his government would be able to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda before the general electionhttps://t.co/dxwSYP0EiA pic.twitter.com/eyOpeeRy5H— YouGov (@YouGov) February 6, 2024      4.41pm GMT   A reader asks:  Would there be a list of all of the Tory MPs that are gathered under this PopCon group? I can’t really find any reference to it online but it’d be interesting to see who exactly these MPs are supposedly representing with their extreme views.  They have not published a list of MP supporters, and their website is little more than a sign up platform. But Beth Rigby from Sky News posted this list of Tory MPs she spotted at the launch.

As PA Media reports, the World Wars Muslim Memorial Trust registered in 2016 and seeks to honour those Muslim soldiers from the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and North Africa who were involved in the two global conflicts. It would also honour Muslim personnel from the UK who have died in combat in recent times. During Treasury questions, the former cabinet minister Sir Sajid Javid said the trust wanted “a memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum honouring an estimated 750,000 Muslims that have fought for British armed forces, with tens of thousands of them paying the ultimate sacrifice”. Pointing out that previous budgets have included funding for memorials, he asked Hunt to back the plan. Hunt said Javid was right. He went on:  We must remember and honour the sacrifices made by those of all nationalities and religions who fought for our freedom, including I believe nearly 150,000 Muslims who died in the Second World War. My officials will be happy to engage with him to identify how best the government can help make this vision a reality.      4.20pm GMT  Government departments still holding back from public too much official data, MPs told  Governement departments are still holding back too much official data, MPs have been told. Ed Humpherson, head of the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), made this argument as he gave evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. He said that although official statistics are routinely published, making the data used to inform policy making was not yet “the norm” – either because officials deciding that releasing the information did not fit in with their communications strategy, or because they just forgot. But he said the culture was gradually changing. He explained:  I think of this as being like a garden on a bright morning where the shadow is gradually retreating and the sunlight is gradually coming across. We have got the sunlight on official statistics. We are gradually moving into that space for government statements being supported and I would love that sunlight to extend into further parts of analysis as well.  Humpherson said there was a “risk” in policy making if data was not being openly assessed. He went on:  The thing I am concerned about is that whenever we talk senior officials about this, we call it intelligent transparency, we get sign-up from senior officials, permanent secretaries who absolutely endorse and recognise it. What we then find is cases where, in a specific moment, a particular department concludes that it is not in its communications interests, or they forget to make the underlying data available. So I would really want to see those commitments that we hear from senior officials being much more publicly made, and much more embedded in their practices and processes.

PA Media reports:  The Stormont parties united this morning to call on prime minister Rishi Sunak to give Northern Ireland the “resources that it needs to deliver effective public services”. The motion was passed unanimously following a debate in the chamber. An amendment by the opposition SDLP calling on finance minister Caoimhe Archibald to work with ministers to produce costed plans for immediate priorities was also passed.  The motion passed unanimously said the assembly “endorses the letter sent to Prime Minister Sunak by all executive ministers calling for our public finances to be placed on a sustainable footing and for the executive to have the resources that it needs to deliver effective public services”.     3.50pm GMT  Truss claims Britain's institutions are too leftwing  Liz Truss, the former prime minister, has given an interview to GB News in which has restated her belief that Conservatives have not been able to achieve everything they wanted to because Britain is too leftwing.  Describing the philosophy behind her new group, Popular Conservatism, she said:  We’ve had a Conservative government for 14 years and we’ve achieved many things, including Brexit trade deals, keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of office. But one of the problems we have, even though we’ve got a Conservative government, is what we’re seeing in our schools, in our universities, in our corporate sector, the spreading of wokery and leftwing ideas. What PopCon is about, is about combating that because the people of Britain want us to deal with real issues. Immigration is too high. The government’s too big, taxes are too high. But what we constantly hear is the left. So PopCon is about challenging that, it is about challenging the leftwing orthodoxy and making it positive to be a Conservative.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    2.54pm GMT   Good afternoon. I’m Andrew Sparrow, picking up again from Martin.  Being out of the office this morning, I missed the Popular Conservatism (or PopCons) launch this morning. You can get the gist of it from the coverage here. (See 12.18pm and 12.26pm.) Lewis Goodall from the News Agents podcast has some good coverage on X too. Here are some of his posts.  Mark Littlewood opening “popcon”: “this is not about the leadership of the Conservative Party…we will position ourselves as a genuine grassroots movement.” pic.twitter.com/oVS1xeCj6i— Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) February 6, 2024   Mark Littlewood opening “popcon”: “this is not about the leadership of the Conservative Party…we will position ourselves as a genuine grassroots movement.”   Littlewood says we’re not governed by our parliament but by a network of state organisations, bodies, left wing infrastructure. Says a complete overhaul of the state necessary. Littlewood is articulating a right wing Bennism focussed on the state rather than market.   Truss says democracy has become “unfashionable” among the young She may be confusing democracy with conservatism Truss says Britain is full of “secret conservatives”- again echoing Bennism. The voters are there really, they just have to be inspired with a true ideology.  Another feature of the launch that has not received much comment, as far as I can see, is the extent to which the Trussite right has split already. (Something else it has in common with Bennism.) At one point Sir Simon Clarke and Ranil Jayawardena were both due to speak. They both served in her cabinet, and were both close to her politically. But Clarke was dropped from the event after he launched a one-man bid to topple Rishi Sunak’s leadership and Jayawardena declared last night that he was not going be in a tweet implying he thought the PopCons were being too disloyal.  We’ve made progress, and we need to stick with the plan – to scrap the bureaucracy that’s held Britain back.❌ Labour would take us back to square one. 📈 I won’t be there tomorrow. I’ll keep making the positive case for growth from the common ground of British politics.   ✅ We’ve made progress, and we need to stick with the plan – to scrap the bureaucracy that’s held Britain back. ❌ Labour would take us back to square one. 📈 I won’t be there tomorrow. I’ll keep making the positive case for growth from the common ground of British politics. https://t.co/Oo4W2mhObp— Ranil Jayawardena MP (@ranil) February 5, 2024  So, that gives you three categories of Trussites: openly anti-Sunak (Clarke), ostensibly pro (Jayawardena) and somewhere-inbetween (Truss herself). And there was a further split in evidence today. Kwasi Kwarteng used to be very close to Truss but, according to some reports, they stopped speaking to each other after she sacked him. Is it coincidence that he decide to announce that he is standing down from parliament on the same day PopCons was being launched by his publicity-hungry ex-boss?     1.55pm GMT   It is opposition day in the Commons today and shadow Home Office minister Alex Norris has opened a debate on banning knives and swords from UK streets. The motion “condemns the government for overseeing a 77% increase in knife crime since 2015”, and asks the government to extend recent measures “to cover ninja swords” and “to establish an end-to-end review of online knife sales and introduce criminal liability for senior management of websites which indirectly sell illegal knives online.” Norris said:  We believe the government should introduce criminal sanctions on the tech executives who allow knife sales on their online market places. Not just Ofcom sanctions as the government have opted for, but proper criminal sanctions to send a very serious message to these leaders that if their platforms are being used, and they are not actively making sure they are not being used for the sale of dangerous weapons, there are going to be serious consequences.  Regarding ninja swords, Norris said “We would broaden the ban to include a wider range of weapons and to toughen existing rules on serration and length. That would mean finally banning blades such as ninja swords … if knives and machetes are prohibited, these firms will just move on to pushing ninja swords at customers. This is a hole in the government’s plan and it must be plugged.”     1.26pm GMT   MPs have criticised the government for not acting over the Horizon IT scandal through its representative on the Post Office board, with one calling it a “fatal flaw” in the way it handles the governance of companies over which it has oversight. The head of UK Government Investments (UKGI) – the body responsible for managing the portfolio of wholly or partially state-owned companies such as NatWest and Channel 4 – admitted the Post Office board needed to be questioned over its lack of “curiosity” about the scandal, which resulted in wrongful prosecution of more than 900 subpostmasters. The Treasury select committee questioned executives from UKGI, which maintains one representative on the Post Office’s 10-strong board, on Tuesday about why the government did not take action sooner given it had a shareholder representative with direct access to the governance and running of the company. Keir Mather, the Labour MP for Selby and Ainsty, questioned whether the lack of action showed “insufficient robustness” by the Treasury-owned UKGI and whether the existence of a shareholder representative undermined the government’s argument that it “couldn’t exercise oversight” of the Post Office.

Current legislation means any MP who is suspended from the Commons for 10 days or more can be subject to a recall petition, which triggers a byelection if it is signed by 10% of the MP’s constituents. The leader of the house said: “I think that the main complaint and concern is the trigger for that process, that by the original legislation having gone from 30 to 10 days it doesn’t give you a lot of options, and I think that’s the chief concern with that. “It’s been in operation for a while. You are starting to get these cases, you of all people will know, where you have found yourself maybe wishing you had more options for individuals, but that’s the chief complaint that’s made to me from colleagues.”     1.06pm GMT   Helena Horton is an environment reporter for the Guardian Greenhouse gas emissions fell slightly in 2022, new government figures reveal, with homes and transport remaining the highest emitting sectors. The emissions for the territorial UK were equivalent to 406.2m tonnes of CO2, down 3.5% from 2021 and 50% from 1990. Homes and transport contributed the most to the problem, with domestic transport responsible for 28% of greenhouse gas emissions, and homes and product use 20%. Agriculture was responsible for 12%, electricity supply 14% and industry 14%. Fuel supply was responsible for 8%, and waste 4%. Land use and forestry created 0.2% of greenhouse gas emissions. Domestic transport emissions rose 2% year on year, but government officials mostly attributed this to a bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic. There was a significant drop in transport emissions in 2020 when people stayed at home due to lockdowns, and travel has not yet recovered to pre-2020 levels. Government policies, such as scrapping high-speed rail projects, building more roads and failing to ensure that rail travel is as reliable and affordable as driving, mean that emissions are unlikely to fall to levels needed to reach net zero, experts have said.

Some clarification was asked for on those spread betting comments from 2023 that have been unearthed after Sunak said he was not a betting man. [See 12.02 GMT] The spokesperson said:  As he said this morning, he was surprised by it [the bet] but it reflects the conversation that he had with Piers Morgan [and] reflects his absolute confidence in getting flights of the ground. Does he regret having that confidence? No. He has previously talked about his love and interest in cricket. Obviously, what he was referring to is the fact that in general he’s not a betting person, and obviously the point he was trying to get across in the interview was his full confidence and commitment in getting flights off the ground.  The spokesperson said Sunak’s comments about enjoying spread betting while at work and watching the Ashes in 2005 were “referring to many, many years ago”.     12.48pm GMT   Rory Carroll is the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent Irish leaders have paid tribute to John Bruton, a former taoiseach who has died aged 76 after illness, as a decent, thoughtful man and a giant of Irish politics. “John was one of the reasons I became involved in politics and joined Fine Gael,” said the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. “John was doer and a philosopher. He was passionately pro-European in government and in opposition.” Varadkar said Bruton, who led a coalition government from 1994 to 1997 during a fraught phase of the peace process, had reached out to Northern Ireland unionists. “He advocated a new patriotism and opposed narrow nationalism. While these views are now held by the majority of people, that was not always the case and he was willing to lead, even when it meant going against the grain.” Varadkar said he drew on his predecessor’s knowledge and experience during Brexit talks with the UK. “The whole Fine Gael family mourns his loss, and he will always be remembered for his service to our party and to the Irish state.” The former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who led Fianna Fáil, lauded Bruton’s integrity. “He was a totally genuine person and always acted in the interests of the people of the country, of the people of need and I wouldn’t have a bad word to say about John Bruton.” Earlier cross-party tributes were paid to Bruton in the Northern Ireland assembly. [See 11.42 GMT]     12.31pm GMT   PA Media has a quick snap that a 46-year-old man has been arrested after MP Mike Freer received a threatening phone call last week. The Conservative minister announced at the start of this month that he will stand down at the next general election, citing a series of death threats and an arson attack on his constituency office.     12.29pm GMT  Rees-Mogg says 'age of Davos man is over' as he attacks ECHR, WHO and COP at PopCons  Former minister for Brexit opportunities Jacob Rees-Mogg was one of the main speakers at the launch of the “Popular Conservatism movement” in London today, and he named the ECHR, World Health Organization and Cop as he attacked “international cabals and quangos telling hundreds of millions of people how to lead their lives”. Declaring that the “age of Davos man is over”, and championing the protests of French farmers, he said that around the world millions of voters have had enough of an “internationalist, unaccountable approach to governing”, also citing the election results in Argentina. Rees-Mogg said bodies such as the World Health Organization and Cop climate summit “limit our freedom for manoeuvre”. “We have to restore power to our democratic institutions and take it away from those that seek to override democracy,” he told the event. Judges are tied to the “international elite”, and “unaccountable, unelected” quangos are “plugged into EU lawmaking,” he said. “We need to re-establish the traditional relationship between the judiciary and parliament.” He said that popular conservatism is about giving voters “freedom over their lives and taking it away from the unaccountable, the faceless, the bureaucrat and the pious platitudes of pompous politicians which have been running this country for too long.” He added “Popular conservatism is the answer and we should be a patriot of this nation alone. A friend of every country, but conscious of the one that is ours and whose interests we must put first.”     12.18pm GMT  Liz Truss says Sunak’s government has failed to take on 'left-wing extremists'  Former prime minister Liz Truss has told the PopCons event in London that Britons want to see lower immigration and want illegal immigrants deported, but that ministers’ efforts are “constantly being stymied”, and that “Conservatives have not taken on the left-wing extremists.” Saying that for two decades Tories had tried to “appease these people”, and also argued that ministers have “responsibility without having power”, because of institutions having greater sway. “I’m afraid we have not taken on the left enough” she said. She claimed the ideology of leftists disguising themselves as environmentalists is about “taking power away from families and giving it to the state and unelected bodies” and is drowning out the need for cheaper energy, and hit out at the government for “pandering to the anti-capitalists”, while ordinary people believe “the wokery that is going on is nonsense”. She said “wokeism seems to be on the curriculum” in schools. Truss, who became prime minister after being appointed by the Conservative party as leader, said “We need to restore faith in democracy and we can only do that by restoring democratic accountability”. She said “the left have been on the march” in UK institutions, in the corporate world and globally, but “Britain is full of secret Conservative forces” of people who are ashamed to admit their values, and that the PopCons group must rally them.     12.02pm GMT   Rishi Sunak told BBC Radio 5 Live this morning “I’m not a betting person and I was taken totally by surprise in the middle of that interview” after the fierce backlash to him appearing to accept a £1,000 bet over the success of the government’s Rwanda deportation scheme with broadcaster Piers Morgan. Which is making it slightly awkward that lots of people have pointed out that in July last year he spoke on the BBC’s Test Match Special View from the Boundary podcast with Johnathan Agnew and explained how much he had enjoyed spread betting on cricket. In the clip doing the rounds on social media he told Agnew:  It was around that time that spread betting had become a thing online. I had certainly never done it before. I was sitting there working on one side doing my investing finance job, and on the other screen – it is quite helpful in those jobs you have multiple screens – I was doing next wicket partnership, next wicket fall, innings total. I just discovered this thing and it was great, so I had the summer doing that as well.  It is worth noting, perhaps, that in the interview he was talking specifically about a period of time when he was living in the US, and came back to the UK for the summer doing an internship, during the 2005 Ashes series, and preceded the anecdote by saying discovering spread betting “was quite dangerous”. The segment starts at 9’20” here.     11.45am GMT   Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is up speaking in the House of Commons at the moment for oral questions for the Treasury.     11.42am GMT  Cross-party tributes paid in Northern Ireland assembly after former Irish taoiseach John Bruton dies aged 76  Just a quick note that former taoiseach John Bruton has died aged 76 after a long illness, his family has confirmed. A statement from the Bruton family, released by Fine Gael on Tuesday, said: “It is with deep sadness we wish to announce the death of former taoiseach John Bruton. He died peacefully in the Mater private hospital in Dublin, surrounded by his loving family, early this morning following a long illness. He was a good husband, a good father and a true patriot. We will miss him greatly.” DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson is among those who have already paid tribute, posting on social media to say “So sorry to hear of the passing of former taoiseach John Bruton. John was a gentleman who as prime minister reached out to unionists to try and gain a better understanding of our position and to encourage practical cooperation. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time.” Northern Ireland first minister Michelle O’Neill (Sinn Féin) expressed her condolences to the Bruton family, speaking in the recently reconvened Assembly, saying: “I want to pass on my condolences to the family of former taoiseach John Bruton, who we’ve just been notified has sadly passed away. To his family and friends, we send them our condolences at this very sad time.” Deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly (DUP) also expressed her condolences, while speaker of the Northern Ireland assembly Edwin Poots (DUP) said he will write to the Bruton family to express his condolences. Bruton was leader of Fine Gael from 1990 to 2001 and taoiseach from 1994 until 1997     11.23am GMT  Starmer says he will 'fight fire with fire' in election campaign  In his interview with Times Radio earlier today, Labour’s leader Keir Starmer has said he expects the Conservative party to “go low” during the forthcoming election campaign, because they aren’t in a position to defend their record in government, but said he would “fight fire with fire”. He told Kate McCann:  I’m going to be up against an opponent, a Conservative party, that the prime minister can’t go to the country on their record, they can’t say, look, we’ve delivered all these brilliant things over 14 years. Vote us back in to keep delivering. They couldn’t do that with a straight face.  They can’t go to the country saying, we’ve got great leadership because they burned through five prime ministers. And the chop and change is a laughing stock across the world. So they inevitably will go to, you know, culture wars and go low. I don’t want to have the argument there, but what I will say is I’ll fight fire with fire, because this election is too important for me to back off. So I’m very happy to have a positive argument. But I will absolutely be fighting fire with fire because I have done everything I can to change this Labour party in four short years, and I’ve shown a ruthlessness and a determination to do so. That will be the same mindset to changing our country for the better, so that I hope we can have an interview in four or five years’ time. And I can say to you … most of the change that you and others challenged me couldn’t be done, we’ve actually done.      11.12am GMT   The PopCon gathering, a new grouping of Conservative MPs and supporters, is taking place in London. Nigel Farage is also there, and perhaps unsurprisingly, is speaking to all and sundry of the media in attendance – I’ve already seen clips of him speaking to LBC and GBNews on social media. He also had some words for PA. He told them:  I’m motivated and interested by ideas. That’s why I was in Ukip and not the Conservative party. I suspect I would agree with a lot of what is said on the platform this morning, but none of it is going to be Conservative manifesto policy. And that’s really the point here. Whilst there were some big names like Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg – I saw Priti Patel coming into the audience earlier – they are a very small minority within the parliamentary Conservative party.  He went on to say the party is now “so far away from the centre of gravity of most Conservative voters, it is almost untrue”. In one of its tweets/Xs ahead of the event, the organisers said of today “on Tuesday the fight back begins”. The Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and during that time Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel all held multiple roles in government.     10.39am GMT   Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor Health and social care spending will fall in Scotland in real terms this year, breaking a significant political promise from the Scottish National party, according to a new analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.MSPs at Holyrood are currently examining next year’s Scottish budget before a final vote on the full package later this month, with Humza Yousaf’s government again putting substantial stress on protecting NHS spending in the next financial year.Yet in a quite striking finding, the IFS has asserted that in real terms, the overall budget for the NHS will fall by 0.7% when additional spending on health and social care since last year’s budget was passed are included. Official budget documents say health spending will grow by 1.3% year on year, including the effects of inflation.The IFS also argues the Scottish government’s presentation of the situation for councils is “seriously misleading.”The budget papers say council funding will increase by 6.2% in real terms compared to last year’s budget, after years of cumulative cuts. But counting in-year increases last year, and the fact councils will have additional spending “burdens” from April onwards, the IFS argues the actual real terms increase is closer to 1.8%.David Phillips, an associate director at the IFS who specialises in devolved government spending, said that overall the budget papers give a “misleading impression” of actual funding next year. He said:“The Scottish government has argued that comparing its latest spending plans for one year with its initial budgets for the next year is problematic. It says this ignores the fact that plans in the next year can change too. And yes, they often do. But plans are plans, and at present the latest stated plan is to spend less on health next year than was spent this year.”The government insists that comparing budget figures is valid, but agreed actual spending would change. “As this IFS report acknowledges, additional in-year funding is crucial to maintaining that real-terms growth, requiring the UK government to prioritise additional funding for health over the course of the year,” a spokesman said. You can find the IFS report here.     10.33am GMT   The first preliminary hearing for module 5 of the UK Covid-19 inquiry is under way. There is a live stream that you can watch on YouTube here. This module will ultimately be of considerable interest, one would imagine, as it “will consider and make recommendations regarding the procurement and distribution to end-users across the four nations of the UK of key healthcare related equipment and supplies, including PPE, ventilators and oxygen.” It will also “assess the robustness and effectiveness of procurement processes, the adequacy of the items obtained (including their specification, quality and volume) and the effectiveness of their distribution to the end-user. It will also consider the UK-wide procurement of lateral flow tests and PCR tests.” The live stream does contain the warning “occasional strong language may form part of evidence”, although we aren’t expecting any of that today from Lady Heather Hallett who will make opening remarks.     10.20am GMT   Here is a little bit more from political correspondent Ben Quinn on the news that former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is to stand down as an MP: The MP’s announcement came as a reminder of the debacle of the ill-fated “mini-budget” under the short-lived government of Liz Truss, hours before Truss was to launch a rightwing Conservative movement called PopCon joined by other senior figures from the party. His has been a generally safe Conservative seat, returning a Labour MP only once in more than 100 years, and Kwarteng secured a majority of 18,393 at the last election. Truss and Kwarteng had once been close but the MP, who was sacked in 2022 by her after only 38 days as chancellor, has since made critical comments, such as that she was “not wired” to be prime minister. As chancellor, Kwarteng was accused of delivering a reckless mini-budget for the rich after his £45bn tax-cutting package sent the pound crashing to its lowest level against the dollar in 37 years. He has since declared thousands of pounds from media appearances and was due to start advising the Australian iron ore miner Fortescue on its clean energy ambitions from last year October – one year after his disastrous mini-budget crashed the pound.

The group is associated with Liz Truss, the former PM, who is speaking at the launch. In an interview with Times Radio, Littlewood insisted that Truss was not the group’s leader. But he went on:  I think the lessons we can draw from her very short time in office are important lessons for Conservatives who want to change Britain, want to see taxes come down.  He also said the group was interested in ideas, and “what might go into party manifestos at the next election”. Littlewood, a former head of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a libertarian thinktank, set out more about the aims of the Popular Conservatism movement in an article in the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend. He said:  We need to break the business model of the anti-free-speech warriors who want to cancel everyone for everything. I do not want to live in a country where people are scared to voice their opinions or politicians cannot legislate to stop young children being socially transitioned at schools because of the Equality Act. This agenda has gone too far. It is time we repealed the Equality Act and rooted out all the taxpayers’ money that is being poured into diversity and inclusivity projects. We need to dismantle the tools being used by the detached elites to tell us how to think and speak. At present, debate is stifled, voices are silenced and division is sowed … Conservatives want power transferred to families, communities, businesses and individuals, instead – but the institutional infrastructure that has grown up in the past two or three decades mitigates against that. If we don’t have a plan to tackle these impediments to freedom, achieving Conservative outcomes will forever feel like pushing water uphill. This is why I am launching a new grassroots movement of Popular Conservatism this week, alongside senior Conservative MPs and some newly selected candidates. PopCon’s mission is twofold: first, to inform and educate candidates and MPs about the need to reform Britain’s bureaucratic structures to allow Conservatives values to flourish. And second, to advance these policies across the country, whilst demonstrating their popularity.  I’m handing over to Martin Belam now. I will be back this afternoon.     9.55am GMT  Starmer says he's 'unwavering' in determination to deliver green energy, which will need borrowing to invest  Keir Starmer has insisted that he is “unwavering” in his determination to deliver green energy for Britain, and that this will in involve borrowing. In an interview with Times Radio, he also restated Labour’s desire to get annual green investment up to £28bn a year – although he stressed that was dependent on the party’s fiscal rules. Labour has now dropped £28bn a year as a cast-iron commitment, and the shadow Treasury team are reluctant to quote the figure at all. This has led to claims that the party is watering down its green energy pledge. But Starmer insisted this morning he was still determined to deliver on his pledge to make electricity generation zero-carbon by 2030. Referring to the clean energy mission, he said:  We’re going to need investment, that’s where the £28bn comes in. That investment that is desperately needed for that mission. You can only understand the investment argument by understanding that we want to have clean power by 2030 … We need to borrow to invest to do that. That’s a principle I believe in and I’m absolutely happy to go out and defend. And of course, what we’ve said as we’ve got closer to the operationalisation of this, is it has to be ramped up, the money has to be ramped up… and everything is subject to our fiscal rules.  Starmer also said he had “been unwavering in relation to the mission – clean power by 2030”.  Updated at 11.18am GMT    9.40am GMT   Kwasi Kwarteng is the 54th Tory MP to say they are standing down at the next election, according to this House of Commons library briefing which contains a spreadsheet listing all MPs, from all parties, who have said they are leaving parliament.     9.29am GMT  Kwasi Kwarteng to stand down as MP at next election  Kwasi Kwarteng, whose career as chancellor under Liz Truss was even shorter than hers as prime minister, because she sacked him after his mini-budget triggered the economic turmoil that brought down her government, has announced he is standing down as an MP at the next election. He has posted this on X.  Yesterday I informed my Association Chair of my decision not to stand at the next General Election. It has been an honour to serve the residents of Spelthorne since 2010, and I shall continue to do so for the remainder of my time in parliament.   Yesterday I informed my Association Chair of my decision not to stand at the next General Election. It has been an honour to serve the residents of Spelthorne since 2010, and I shall continue to do so for the remainder of my time in Parliament.— Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) February 6, 2024  Kwarteng was elected MP for Spelthorne in Surrey in 2010. At the last election he had a majority of 18,393.  Updated at 11.58am GMT    9.10am GMT  Sunak tries to explain shaking hands on £1,000 Rwanda policy bet by saying he was 'taken totally by surprise' in interview  Good morning. Rishi Sunak gave an interview to Rachel Burden on Radio 5 Live this morning and he was asked about a £1,000 bet he appeared to accept from Piers Morgan about the success of his Rwanda policy. The move has been widely condemned as distasteful. Sunak did not argue that he did not accept the bet. (We saw him shake hands on it, although at the same time he was avoiding confirming verbally that he accepted Morgan’s challenge.) But this morning he did imply that he was bounced into it. He said that, twice, that he was taken “totally by surprise” and he insisted that betting wasn’t his thing. He said:  I’m not a betting person and I was taken totally by surprise in the middle of that interview.  Asked if it was a mistake, he said:  No, well the point I was trying to get across – as I was taken totally by surprise – the point I was trying to get across was actually about the Rwanda policy and about tackling illegal migration because it’s something I care deeply about. Obviously people have strong views on this and I just was underlining my absolute commitment to this policy and my desire to get it through parliament, up and running, because I believe you need to have a deterrent.  Burden then put it to him that casually shaking hands of a £1,000 bet, when that sum is worth more than the combined cost of the three cost of living payments being given to low-income families (the final payments start going out today) suggested he did not really understand the pressures people were facing. Sunak said that he was being asked about the Rwanda policy, and that he wanted to stress that he was totally committed to it. On cost of living, Sunak insisted that he did understand the pressures people were facing, and he claimed his record showed that.  When it comes to cost of living, when I first got this job I set out five priorities – the first of them was to halve inflation because I absolutely understood that the cost of living was the most pressing problem most families faced.  The Liberal Democrats were not impressed by Sunak’s explanation. Responding to this morning’s interview, Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said:  Rishi Sunak either does not care or does not get it. As the prime minister buries his head in the sand and pretends everything is fine, people across the country are suffering. Most people when they are hit with a surprise £1,000 bill worry about how they are going to make their next mortgage payments or put food on the table for their children. Instead, the prime minister does not even register the significance of that amount of money. Out of touch does not even begin to describe Sunak. The prime minister’s cold soundbites that everything is working simply do not survive contact with reality.  I’m Andrew Sparrow and I will be here until 10am, when Martin Belam will be taking over the blog. I will be back to pick it up in the afternoon. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 10.30am: Heather Hallett, chair of the Covid inquiry, makes an introductory statement at a procedural hearing about the module 5 stage of the inquiry, covering procurement. 11am: Liz Truss, the former PM, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, and Lee Anderson, the former Tory deputy chair, speak at the launch of a new group called Popular Conservatism. 11.15am: Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, gives evidence to the Commons standards committee on disciplinary processes in the Commons. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 2.30pm: Edward Argar, the prisons minister, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a laptop or a desktop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.

        "content": "No civil servant who went through the complaints process against the former justice secretary Dominic Raab would ever want to go through it again, such was the ordeal, MPs have been told. There was “zero confidence” in the process of raising complaints about ministers and the ministerial code was “completely inadequate”, trade union leaders representing civil servants told the Commons standards committee. Party leaders were “failing to get their house in order” when it came to protecting employees from the behaviour of MPs and excluding accused figures from the parliamentary estate, Dave Penman and Mike Clancy, the general secretaries respectively of the FDA and Prospect unions, told the committee. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, later told the same committee that MPs had complained that the threshold for triggering a recall petition was too low. Under current legislation, any MP who is suspended from the Commons for 10 days or more can be subject to a recall petition, which triggers a byelection if it is signed by 10% of the MP’s constituents. Mordaunt said several MPs had complained to her that the 10-day threshold meant there were no “middle options” for censuring misbehaving MPs short of them potentially losing their seat. Earlier, Penman told the committee that the ministerial code was “completely and utterly inadequate” for the purpose of regulating conduct among ministers and civil servants, citing the cases of prime ministers who he said had refused to sanction investigations against political allies or acknowledge evidence. “There is one individual who decides whether there will be an investigation and what the outcome of that investigation will be and there is zero confidence in the process of raising complaints. Ask anyone involved in the recent high-profile complaint against the former justice minister and they will say they will never go through that process again,” he said.  Clancy said when it came to the need for MPs to undergo training to make them better employers, “MPs need to own the desire to have that training and as an overall cohort stand up to what I think would be criticisms of this from certain elements of the media that this was a form of ‘woke’ behaviour forced upon them reluctantly.” He said: “We don’t want add to that particular bonfire but if MPs are able to approach this positively it will make them better parliamentarians and improve our democracy.” In their written evidence to the committee, the trade unions said they had been pressing over the past two years for parliament to adopt a formal mechanism by which MPs arrested on suspicion of a sexual or violent offence would be prevented from accessing the parliamentary estate and from undertaking parliamentary-funded travel. “But there is a growing fear that institutional inertia – as opposed to outright resistance – might delay further progress on this until after the election,” they added."

        "content": "It was an event intended to mark the reinvigoration of rightwing conservatism. But even before the first speaker took to the stage on Tuesday morning, the Popular Conservatism group had splintered. Of the four MPs billed to speak, just two were present – Liz Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg. The former cabinet minister Ranil Jayawardena, regarded by some as a rising star of the Tory right, pulled out on Monday with a swipe at his fellow panellists. And Simon Clarke, another Trussite former cabinet minister, was removed from the line-up by the organisers two weeks ago after calling for Rishi Sunak to be ousted. “This isn’t about the leadership of Rishi Sunak,” the director Mark Littlewood, who until recently led the Institute of Economic Affairs, told the room. “I’m personally immovable in my view that Rishi Sunak should lead the Conservatives into the next general election.” But although none of the speakers openly questioned Sunak’s leadership, much of the rest of the event amounted to an evisceration of his policies. The former Conservative party vice-chair Lee Anderson attacked the government over its approach to net zero. He called for coal mines to be reopened in the north of England and for people to be able to choose whether to pay green levies on their energy bills. “We’re burning coal in our power stations but it’s foreign coal,” he said. “How is that contributing to net zero? It’s an absolute nonsense.” He also said his constituents weren’t “lying awake at night worrying about net zero”. The parliamentary candidate Mhairi Fraser, who is standing in Chris Grayling’s safe Tory seat of Epsom and Ewell, launched an extended attack on Sunak’s smoking ban and the Covid lockdowns. She said the ban would create a “ludicrous two-tier system where in the years to come a 50-year-old man will be able to legally buy his cigarettes but his 49-year-old wife will not”. “Once one freedom is surrendered, other freedoms follow, because the state is no Mary Poppins,” she said. “Let us never forget the nanny in her most monstrous form – the Covid lockdowns .… It’s time to put nanny to bed.” Rees-Mogg declared that the “age of Davos man is over” and Truss urged her colleagues to stop worrying about getting a job in Sunak’s government and take the fight to “left-wing extremists” running UK institutions instead.   Related: Davos man thrives while the rest of us pay for his excesses | Will Hutton   Truss claimed these included “environmentalists” and those who are “in favour of supporting LGBT people or groups of ethnic minorities”. Lord Gavin Barwell, former chief of staff to Theresa May, called for Truss to lose the Tory whip for those remarks. He said: “Liz Truss has done more than enough damage to the Conservative party already. She should apologise for this offensive nonsense or lose the whip.” This would force her to sit as an independent MP in the Commons.  The Popular Conservatism group also aims to pile pressure on the prime minister to cut taxes, to adopt hardline policies on immigration and to leave the European convention on human rights. Many Tory MPs on the right of the party decided to stay away. “I’m not sure what space this is meant to fill,” one MP said privately. “The Conservative Growth Group already advocates libertarian economics. The Common Sense Conservatives talk about cultural issues.” Meanwhile Kwasi Kwarteng – formerly Truss’s chancellor and closest political ally – pointedly decided to announce that he will not be seeking re-election as an MP. One person who was present was the former Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, in his capacity as a GB News presenter. A few years ago, Tories found to be associating with him risked suspension from the party – but on Tuesday attendees were lining up to take pictures with him. Farage said he was not seeking to join the Conservatives, “given what they stand for”, but he did not rule out standing for parliament with Richard Tice’s party, Reform. “I suspect I would agree with a lot of what is said on the platform this morning, but none of it is going to be Conservative manifesto policy,” he said. “Whilst there were some big names like Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg – I saw Priti Patel coming into the audience earlier – they are a very small minority within the parliamentary Conservative party.”   Related: A guide to the key Conservative tribes as party conference looms   Labour and the Liberal Democrats mocked the new Tory grouping. The shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, wrote to the panellists on Monday night asking whether they still supported unfunded tax cuts and the use of offshore tax havens. The Lib Dems published a social media graphic of the Top of the Pop[Con]s “greatest hits” – including Common (Etonian) People and It’s the End of the Tories As We Know It (And I Feel Fine). Unfazed, Truss insisted; “Britain is full of secret Conservatives – people who agree with us but don’t want to admit it because they think it’s not acceptable in their place of work, it’s not acceptable at their school.” Littlewood said the Popular Conservatives, or PopCons, would be taking their arguments to voters around the country. The response they get will be a test of Truss’s claims."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has rowed back on a £1,000 bet with the broadcaster Piers Morgan on whether deportation flights to Rwanda would take off before the general election, saying he was “not a betting person”.\nThe prime minister said on Tuesday he had been “taken by surprise” when Morgan said to him during a TalkTV interview: “I’ll bet you £1,000 to a refugee charity [that] you don’t get anybody on those planes before the election. Will you take that bet?”\nSunak shook hands with Morgan on the wager and said he was “working incredibly hard to get the people on the planes”.\nThe government’s attempt to send people arriving in the UK through irregular means to Rwanda for their claims to be processed has been blocked by the supreme court, which ruled the policy was unlawful in November. Sunak has said he can salvage the scheme.\nHowever, when asked about the “bet” in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday, Sunak said: “I am not a betting person and I was taken totally by surprise in that interview.\n“The point I was trying to get across – I was taken totally by surprise – was actually about the Rwanda policy and about tackling illegal migration, which is something I care deeply about.\n“Obviously people have strong views on this and I was just underlining my absolute commitment to this policy, my desire to get it through parliament, up and running because I believe you need to have the deterrent.\n“I believe you have got to have a deterrent, you have got to have somewhere you can send people so that if they come here illegally they won’t be able to stay.”\nHowever, soon after Sunak’s claims that he was “not a betting person”, it was pointed out on social media that that he had worked in the past as a hedge fund manager and had boasted about discovering the “dangerous” pleasures of spread betting online around the same time.\n​In an interview last year for an episode of the BBC’s Test Match Special podcast, Sunak had recalled that time, saying: “So I was sitting there on one side working, doing my finance job, and on the other screen I was doing next wicket partnership, next wicket for, innings total. I just discovered this thing and it was great.”\nOpposition parties criticised Sunak’s decision to agree to the bet with Morgan. The shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Not a lot of people facing rising mortgages, bills and food prices are casually dropping £1,000 bets. It just shows that Rishi Sunak is totally out of touch with working people.”\nThe Scottish National party reported Sunak to the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, Laurie Magnus, claiming the bet could be a breach of the ministerial code.\nAsked if he understood the financial pressures facing ordinary households, given he had made a £1,000 bet on a whim, Sunak said: “When it comes to cost of living, when I first got this job I set out five priorities – the first of them was to halve inflation because I absolutely understood that the cost of living was the most pressing problem most families faced.”\nAsked if it shocked him that poor families were reportedly having to water down baby formula, the prime minister replied: “Of course I am sad to hear that people are in that situation.”\nHe said it was difficult to comment on individual cases that were put to him and he committed to sitting down with the people involved if he was written to."

        "content": "Keir Starmer has said Labour’s policy pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment is “desperately needed,” as he re-opened an issue that has become a source of tension in the party. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, were planning to ditch the pledge, party sources had said as recently as last week, while the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury all but confirmed the move a day later. However, comments from Starmer broadcast on Tuesday morning were welcomed by advocates of the pledge as a “recommitment” at a time when other senior party figures had declined to use the figure. The Labour leader said in an interview with Times Radio that he had been “unwavering” in relation to the party’s green energy plans and denied he was “scaling back” policies as this year’s general election looms. “We’re going to need investment, that’s where the £28bn comes in. That investment that is desperately needed for that mission,” he said “You can only understand the investment argument by understanding that we want to have clean power by 2030 … We need to borrow to invest to do that. “That’s a principle I believe in and I’m absolutely happy to go out and defend. And of course, what we’ve said as we’ve got closer to the operationalisation of this, is it has to be ramped up, the money has to be ramped up … and everything is subject to our fiscal rules.” Zoë Billingham, the director of the IPPR North thinktank, said on X after Starmer’s comments emerged: “It’s reassuring that ⁦@UKLabour have recommitted to their £28bn green investment pledge. It a cornerstone of meeting climate goals & regional growth.” Opposition to watering down the £28bn commitment has come from across the spectrum, uniting Labour MPs from the party’s left with others in the centre, while business leaders have also thrown their weight behind it. They included Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens, the German industrial giant and major investor, who said last week that the proposed investment of £28bn a year in the low-carbon economy was an “absolute minimum”. Labour sources have said the party would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as already announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company, and a mass home insulation programme. But they added that the party would in effect cut its green ambitions by about two-thirds, given that the previously announced schemes are set to cost just under £10bn a year by the end of the parliament. Starmer’s language contrasted with the approach taken in a series of media interviews after speeches by Reeves and Starmer to a conference in London attended recently by hundreds of business executives, in which the shadow chancellor was repeatedly asked about the £28bn figure and declined each time to back it. Asked 10 times during an interview with Sky News, Reeves said of the plan: “I think what people need to know is that the fiscal rules are the most important thing for me … I know the importance of economic and fiscal stability and that will always come first.”"

        "content": "Kwasi Kwarteng, the former chancellor who oversaw the ill-fated “mini-budget” under the short-lived government of Liz Truss, has said he will not stand again as an MP at the next election. The MP’s announcement came as a reminder of the debacle, hours before Truss was to launch a rightwing Conservative movement called PopCon, joined by other senior figures from the party Kwarteng, who represents Spelthorne, in Surrey, said he had told his constituency association on Monday that he would not fight the election. He tweeted: “It has been an honour to serve the residents of Spelthorne since 2010, and I shall continue to do so for the remainder of my time in Parliament.” His has been a generally safe Conservative seat, returning a Labour MP only once in more than 100 years, and Kwarteng secured a majority of 18,393 at the last election. More than 80 sitting MPs have announced they will leave parliament at the next election, more than the 74 who retired in 2019. Kwarteng joins dozens of other Tory MPs who have announced that they will not be contesting the election, at a time when current polls indicate that the party faces a wipeout. Truss and Kwarteng had once been close but the MP, who was sacked in 2022 by her after only 38 days as chancellor, has since made critical comments, such as that she was “not wired” to be prime minister. “I love her dearly, she’s a great person, very sincere and honest,” he told the Telegraph’s political editor, Ben Riley-Smith, in a book last year. “But if it hadn’t been the mini-budget, she would have blown up on something else”. There was an unforgiving reaction from many to the news that Kwarteng is to step down from parliament. The Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted: “Kwasi Kwarteng made everyone’s mortgages rise, his tenure as chancellor a dangerous embarrassment. I was stood next to him when I received news that my cat had been hit by a car and forever this association for which he is (as best I know) blameless is what I associate with him.” As chancellor, Kwarteng was accused of delivering a reckless mini-budget for the rich after his £45bn tax-cutting package sent the pound crashing to its lowest level against the dollar in 37 years. He has since declared thousands of pounds from media appearances and was due to start advising the Australian iron ore miner Fortescue on its clean energy ambitions from last year October – one year after his disastrous mini-budget crashed the pound."

        "content": "It was the interview Piers Morgan insisted they all wanted – a chance for one lucky person to sit down with him for a whole hour. Piers is the most important person in any room he enters; if you understand that you will get along with him just fine. His ego is in inverse proportion to his self worth. There is Piers World or there is nothing. That level of narcissism must get tiring after a while – the constant struggle to reconfigure reality, the terror of it all falling apart. Not that Rishi Sunak looked particularly grateful to be granted an audience on TalkTV. Rather he seemed edgy and on guard. As if he would rather have been anywhere else but had been nudged into a game of high stakes macho bullshit politics. He had to prove he was man enough to last an hour with the UK Sun God. He said he would do it a year ago and he’s a man who does what he says. Except when he doesn’t, of course. “How are you?” asked Morgan, welcoming Sunak into an ante-room in No 10. Piers looked fine. He always does. A mixture of too much Botox, perhaps, and a conscience that doesn’t trouble him nearly as much as it ought to. Rishi, put it mildly, looked shit. The last year has not been kind to him. He’s aged a lot and appears far older than his early 40s. If ever a man could do with a prolonged California detox, it’s Sunak. Piers quickly reminded Rishi who was boss. They had last met on a flight to LA at Christmas. In first class, natch. But Piers had taken the front row seats. Again, natch. No one can out-Piers Piers. Not that he would like everyone to know that. But sometimes he just can’t help himself. Anyway, time to try to put the interviewee at ease. By telling Sunak that he understands how difficult it can be to be prime minister. Hell, he, Piers, has basically been prime minister for the last 25 years. He knows Downing Street far better than Rishi. But not to worry. He’s one of the good guys. So he’ll make allowances for him. Maybe they could just do a bit of mutual arse-kissing? Piers quite likes that. He knows it’s wrong but deep down he needs to be loved. On to some awkward blokey bants that made Sunak look more and more uncomfortable, out of his depth. Which, to be fair, was to his credit. You wouldn’t necessarily want to be at home on Planet Morgan. Who knew Gareth Southgate the best? Who knew Tony Blair the best? Who had watched more England cricket? No contest. But thanks for taking part. Who had more charisma? Rishi or Keir Starmer? Sunak tried to change the subject. “Starmer doesn’t have a plan,” he said. Piers didn’t pick him up on this. Didn’t say that the Labour leader has been going on and on about his plan for the last year. Because deep down the interview was all about Piers. This was his show, his ratings. His questions were always going to be much more interesting than Rishi’s answers. They were just linking segments. Talking of which: according to the YouTube statistics, there were about 5,000 people watching the early showing of the real prime minister interviewing the prime minister. Who was to know which was which? Neither had been elected. And of those who had tuned in, not everyone seemed to be following the conversation. Someone called Aaa typed: “Rishi is good looking enough to have secret affairs with British wives.” Thanks for that insight, Aaa. Then on to the safety of people in the public eye. Another subject close to Morgan’s heart. “Keir Starmer is a terrorist sympathiser,” said Sunak during a segment on Israel and Gaza. Really? Piers just nodded that through. Didn’t make any attempt to challenge it.Then again, he also didn’t make much of the US losing interest in Ukraine. Probably best not to remind people no one had fawned over Donald Trump more than him in the early years of his presidency. That reality had been rewritten. We were in an alternative Piersphere. For the last half hour, Rishi moved on to his five pledges, and Morgan was there to mark the homework. A grateful nation awaited. Inflation, that was a pass. Though Sunak had done nothing to make it happen. Debt, that was a half mark. Er … it’s actually gone up. But apparently it’s in Piers’s gift to award marks for bullshit. He’s an expert in that. Morgan was equally indulgent about growth. Another half mark for the possibility we may be out of recession by 0.1% by next month. Apparently that’s what Sunak had always meant. That and hopefully growing the economy some time in the next year, though not so much that anyone would notice. This wasn’t turning into the most rigorous or demanding interview. All that mattered was that it was longer than anyone else’s. Sunak had to concede that the health service was a big fail. His team may not thank him for that, though it’s hard to argue otherwise. Piers also knew it was a fail because his mother had to wait on a trolley after having a heart attack. Only things of which Morgan has had direct experience can actually be said to have happened. Everything else is just a fantasy. Finally to the small boats. Morgan was inclined to give Rishi a tick. Even though he had said he would stop the boats, not stop a few of them. Language can mean whatever you want. But Piers did have a big problem, he said. He thought the Rwanda plan was rubbish. And when Piers has a problem, he offers a bet. This could have been Morgan getting all Billy Big Bollocks about football with Gary Lineker on X after a couple of bottles of Château Margaux. Only it was with the prime minister over the lives of refugees. And Sunak was mad enough to accept. Because to both of them, £1,000 means nothing. Just loose change. And Rishi wanted to look tough with Piers. It was a low moment in TV interviewing. It was an even lower moment for British politics. Two men who literally gave a toss about nothing except their egos. A bonfire of the vanities. Luckily, that was it. Sunak looked relieved when Morgan let him go. It had been a long hour. Then any hour with Piers invariably is. Someone called Julian wrote on the YouTube chat board: “Free Drugs.” I knew how he felt."

        "content": "  6.04pm GMT  Early evening summary   Rishi Sunak has been widely criticised for accepting a £1,000 bet with TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan relating to whether he will manage to get deportation flights off to Rwanda before the election. Morgan said he would bet £1,000 that the flights would not happen, with the money going to charity, and Sunak insisted he wanted to get people on the planes. Sunak, whose family has a fortune worth hundreds of millions of pounds, was accused of being not just out of touch with the experience of ordinary Britons, but “grotesque, callous and downright cruel”. (See 4.30pm.)   Rishi Sunak has acknowledged that he has failed to keep his promise to cut healthcare waiting lists.   The British and Irish governments have played down Sinn Féin’s calls for Irish unity and said Northern Ireland’s new devolved government can restore stability and faith in the region.      5.53pm GMT  Disability Action Plan aimed at improving disabled people's lives 'here and now', says minister  A Disability Action Plan published by the government today is aimed at “improving disabled people’s daily lives in the here and now”, Mims Davies, the minister for disabled people, told MPs today. The plan includes 14 goals for this year such as supporting disabled people who want to be elected to public office, including disabled people’s needs in emergency and resilience planning, and making playgrounds more accessible.  Updated at 6.09pm GMT    5.39pm GMT   In the Commons Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dems’ home affairs spokesperson, used a point of order to ask for confirmation that Rishi Sunak’s £1,000 bet with Piers Morgan was a registerable interest and one that he would have to declare in future proceedings. In response Sir Roger Gale, a deputy speaker, said that if every MP who made a bet had to declare it, the register might get rather full. But that was not a matter for him, he said.

After the UK participated in raids against the Houthis with the US for the third time at the weekend, Shapps told MPs:  We would much rather the Houthis simply stopped attacking international shipping, stopped damaging global trade and stop harming the prospects of their own people. At the same time, appeasing the Houthis today will not lead to a more stable Red Sea, indeed a more stable region. We are not seeking confrontation and we urge the Houthis and all those who enable them to stop these illegal and unacceptable attacks. But, if necessary, the UK will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence.      5.25pm GMT   The PM’s £1,000 Rwanda bet has made the top of Radio 4’s PM programme. With commendable BBC fairness, the presenter, Evan Davis, says that even though Sunak shook hands with Piers Morgan after challenged to the bet, he did not confirm it verbally. Davis says No 10 has not given an answer when asked whether or not Sunak did think he was agreeing to a bet. (Looking at the video footage, it is fairly obvious that Sunak was accepting – while somewhere in his head a warning signal was going off telling him not to say the words “bet” or £1,000”. A more experienced politician, or one with a better feel for how this would look, would not have let himself be bounced into this sort of competitive wallet-waving by Piers Morgan.)     5.04pm GMT   Rishi Sunak is facing a growing wave of criticism over his £1,000 Rwanda bet with Piers Morgan. Here are comments on X from politicians. From Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP  Words fail me that PM & Piers Morgan can be so callous about awful Rwanda policy that they place a bet on itThese are people’s lives they’re gambling over.

MPs have condemned plans by the former Tory backbencher to host the event weeks after members of the AfD party were caught in discussion with neo-Nazis about carrying out mass deportations.There was also concern that parliament could be used as a platform for the dissemination of conspiracy theories after Bridgen said the event, billed as a meeting of the Save Our Sovereignty campaign group, would discuss issues including “vaccine harms”, 15-minute cities and a “power grab” by the World Health Organization. Georgie Laming, Director of Campaigns at Hope not hate said:   We can see a clear pattern of radicalisation from Andrew Bridgen. He is using his platform as an MP to invite and promote some of the most controversial and hateful politicians and ideas.When the German government is actively considering banning the AfD for undermining democracy, it is not right to be hosting its members in our seat of government.      4.30pm GMT  SNP condemns Sunak's £1,000 Rwanda bet as 'grotesque, callous and downright cruel'  The SNP has gone further than Labour (see 4.03pm) and is arguing that Rishi Sunak’s £1,000 Rwanda bet with Piers Morgan was in breach of the ministerial code and the Nolan principles for standards in public life. Kirsty Blackman, the SNP’s spokesperson for the Cabinet Office, said:  Placing a bet on the lives of vulnerable refugees fleeing war and persecution is grotesque, callous and downright cruel - and shows just how out of touch Westminster is with the values of people in Scotland. It’s particularly shameful that Rishi Sunak, one of the richest men in the UK, thinks it’s appropriate to accept a £1,000 wager - and will remind ordinary working families that near billionaire Sunak doesn’t have a clue what life is like for the rest of us in a cost of living crisis.  In an open letter calling for an inquiry, addressed to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and Sir Laurie Magnus, the PM’s independent adviser on ministerial interests (aka the “ethics adviser”), Blackman explains she thinks Sunak has broken the code. She says:  It also appears to be a clear breach of the ministerial code and the Nolan Principles of Public Life. Section 1.3 of the ministerial code is clear that:f. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between their public duties and their private interests;g. Ministers should not accept any gift or hospitality which might, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an improper obligation; Point 1.2 and 1.3 of the Seven Principles of Public Life state that:1.2 Integrity - Holders of public office must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work. They should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.1.3 Objectivity - Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias. The bet falls below the high standards people should expect of those in public life - not least the most powerful person in the Westminster government.      4.03pm GMT  Labour says Sunak's £1,000 bet with Piers Morgan over Rwanda policy shows he's 'out of touch'  In his interview with Rishi Sunak on TalkTV Piers Morgan said he was willing to bet the PM £1,000, with the money going to a refugee charity, that no deportation planes to Rwanda will take off before the general election. Sunak said he was working “incredibly hard” to get the flights going and he accepted the bet (although a bit reluctantly, judging by the clip).

Responding to the inteview, Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said:  Not a lot of people facing rising mortgages, bills and food prices are casually dropping £1,000 bets It just shows that Rishi Sunak is totally out of touch with working people.  (Presumably one reason why Sunak did shake on the bet was because, if he hadn’t, he might have been accused of not having confidence in his own policy.)  Updated at 4.05pm GMT    3.50pm GMT  Rail services in north of England have got worse over past decade, says Andy Burnham  Rail services in the north of England have got worse over the past decade, Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor has said. Speaking at the Transport for the North annual conference in Liverpool, Burnham said:  It’s 10 years this year since George Osborne came to Manchester and promised a Northern Powerhouse. That was going to mean HS2, HS3, as it was then called, now Northern Powerhouse Rail, better everyday services on the existing network. You name it, we were going to be promised all of this. Barely any of it has happened. In fact, new analysis that TfGM (Transport for Greater Manchester) has done says that rail services are poorer now than they were in 2016.  Speaking to the media after his speech, Burnham said:  This general election year, I think, lands at an uncomfortable moment for a government that promised to level up because we have proof that railways have gone backwards in the decade since George Osborne made that speech. It’s almost unbelievable.   Updated at 4.32pm GMT    3.39pm GMT  Sunak says UK has not changed stance on recognising Palestinian state and Cameron's comments 'over-interpreted'  Rishi Sunak has said that David Cameron’s recent comments about the UK bringing forward the point at which it might recognise a Palestinian state have been “over-interepreted”. Last week, speaking to the Conservative Middle East Council, Cameron, the foreign secretary, said it was important to give the Palestinian people “a political horizon so that they can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution and crucially the establishment of a Palestinian state”.  He restated the argument on a visit to Lebanon, saying recognition could come before the end of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.   Related: UK could recognise a Palestinian state before a deal with Israel, says Cameron   Antony Blinken, Cameron’s US counterpart, has been exploring the same idea. But at PMQs last week Sunak seemed less keen and, in his interview with Piers Morgan for TalkTV, Sunak said the UK’s position had not changed. Asked if Cameron’s comments represented a shift in UK policy, Sunak replied:  No. Look, our position is the same, and as David was saying, we are committed to a two state solution, we are absolutely committed … The government’s long-standing position has been that we will recognize a Palestinian state at the time that it is most conducive to the peace process.  Asked if that meant the UK could recognise a Palestinian state before the conclusion of peace talks, Sunak said it was “hard to speculate”. But he did not accept policy had changed. He went on:  I think it [the Cameron intervention] has been over-interpreted. What we are absolutely committed to is a two state solution, the recognition of Palestine should come at a point where it is most conducive to the overall process. But at the moment? No. At the moment what we are looking to do is build the conditions to get hostages out, aid in, a sustainable ceasefire that looks forward to the future that the foreign secretary talked about, where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side, both with dignity, with peace, with security and opportunity.   Updated at 3.40pm GMT    3.10pm GMT  Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly insist they are united in wanting better public services and funding for NI  Michelle O’Neill, the first minister, and Emma Little-Pengelly, the deputy first minister, have been holding a press briefing. O’Neill said the financial settlement for Northern Ireland “sounds good on the face of it”. But she said the executive needed more, because for many years it had been under-funded. She said the executive was working together on this. And “we are not going to give up on day one,” she said. Little-Pengelly said Northern Ireland needed money for investment. And Rishi Sunak, as a former chancellor, understood that investment was needed if the public services were going to reform, she said. Asked about her comment about a border poll taking place within 10 years, O’Neill said she did not want to talk about that today. Today she and Little-Pengelly were showing a united front, and focusing on public services. Little-Pengelly says the executive will only find solutions by working together. That is what the public expect, she said.     2.42pm GMT   Northern Ireland doesn’t just have its first nationalist first minister. It also has its first nationalist leader of the opposition, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said today. The SDLP, a nationalist party, did not win enough seats in the elections to have a minister in the power sharing executive, and Matthew O’Toole, its leader at Stormont, will lead opposition to the executive. Eastwood said:  We have seen monumental change in this place with the first ever nationalist first minister and the first ever nationalist leader of the opposition in Matthew O’Toole. We’re very excited to be part of the official opposition, to begin to hold a new government to account. We’ve obviously been very frustrated over the last two years as the public have been that we haven’t been able to deal with the crisis in our public services but now we hope to support the new government in seeking more funds from the British government but of course we will also seek this new executive to have a plan for what they will do with that.      2.27pm GMT       1.48pm GMT  Leo Varadkar seeks to reassure unionists - summary of his press conference  Relations between London and Dublin are considerably better than they were when Boris Johnson was PM. There are still not ideal – the Irish government is taking the UK to the European court of human rights over its Troubles legacy act – but at his news conference Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach went out of his way to avoid saying anything that would cause trouble for No 10. Here are the main points.  Varadkar sought to reassure unionists worried about having a Sinn Féin first minister, saying he expected the new executive to focus on day-to-day issues. Some unionists were alarmed to see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill take office, and she will have confirmed their fears by saying at the weekend that she expected to see a referendum on reunification within a decade. (See 11.22am.) Varadkar has said before that he does expected reunification within his lifetime. But, when asked about this issue, he said that was “not for today”. He backed Rishi Sunak in saying the executive should focus on day-to-day issues. (See 12.28pm.) And he insisted they were doing this. He told reporters:   Certainly, the sense that I got from the first minister, the deputy minister and the the executive is they’re very keen to get stuck into their briefs, and very keen to work on those day-to-day issues and we’re here to help.   He said that although he had “some reservations” about what was in the Safeguarding the Union command paper published by the UK government last week, “particularly some of the more negative language around the all-island economy”, overall it was acceptable. He explained:    Crucially, nothing in what’s been negotiated breaks any red lines. I remember when Brexit happened, we set out a number of objectives. One was to make sure there’s no hard border between north and south. The other was to make sure that the Republic of Ireland’s position in the European single market wasn’t undermined in any way. And the third was to make sure that the Good Friday agreement institutions would function. And all of those things are the case today. That makes it a very positive day in my view.  In the command paper the UK government describes the concept of an all-island economy, which was seen as a fact by previous governments, as “divisive and misguided”. And it says:  Whilst access to the EU market has broad support amongst business and consumers, the creation of a new political construct of the ‘all-island economy’ is clearly more divisive in nature and has been rejected by the current government.   Varadkar said that he felt confident that the Northern Ireland executive was now “here to last”.   He said he had had a good meeting with Sunak. But he sidestepped a question about why they had not held a joint press conference.   He said that, while he would not rule out reforming the way Stormont works, he was not suggesting that now because “a period of bedding down and focusing on the day-to-day issues really should come first”.   He rejected a report the claim in Policy Exchange report that Ireland is weak on defence. (See 1.12pm.)

(See 11.49am.) He said he had not read the whole thing, but he had read a summary and did not agree with it. He went on:  As a country and a government, we take security and defence very seriously. We are dramatically scaling up our defence budget in the Republic of Ireland, and also we’re getting more involved in international security.  We’ve always been actively involved in the UN. But we are founding members of Pesco [Permanent Structured Cooperation – an EU organisation], which is the common European security and defence policy, we’re part of that. We’re also updating our relationship with Nato through the Partnership for Peace. So we take security matters very seriously.       1.00pm GMT       12.51pm GMT  Sunak declines to back call from Brianna Ghey's mother for under-16s to be banned from social media on phones  Rishi Sunak has declined to give his backing to calls by the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey for social media apps to be banned on smartphones for under-16s, PA Media reports. Esther Ghey is campaigning for searches for inappropriate material to be flagged to parents in the wake of the sentencing of her transgender daughter’s killers. Asked about the case during his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak said:  As a parent, I am always worried about social media and what my young girls are exposed to That’s why I’m pleased we have passed the Online Safety Act over the last year and that means the regulator now has tough new powers to control what is exposed to children online. And if the big social media companies do not comply with that, the regulator is able to levy very significant fines on them and the priority now is making sure that act is up and running.  At the weekend Ghey told the BBC she wanted a law “that there are mobile phones that are only suitable for under-16s”. But Sunak declined to say whether the government would back such an idea. In December it was reported that Sunak was considering banning under-16s from some social media. But at PMQs two weeks ago, when asked by a Conservative MP to confirm that he was considering this as an option, Sunak dodged the question. In the US some states are legislating to restrict teenagers’ access to social media. In Florida a law is going through that would stop under-16s creating a new social media account.

He says he is keen to work with the new executive, and to get North/South cooperation up and running again. The North South Council, set up under the Good Friday agreement to allow the Irish government and the Northern Ireland executive to liaise, has not been meeting. Asked about reunification, and what Rishi Sunak said about Michelle O’Neill (see 11.22am and 11.56am), Varadkar says:  The priority for any new executive in any government in any country has to be the day-to-day concerns for people.  Another reporter tries, and asks Varadkar if he expects to see a united Ireland. In the past Varadkar has said he does expect to see a united Ireland in his lifetime, but now he says that is not a question to answer today. This is from Christopher Hope from GB News.

(See 10.48am.) Asked about their objections, he said:  The funding package that we put on the table before Christmas has, I think, been widely recognised as being significant and generous. [It is focused on] long-term sustainability, ensuring that Northern Ireland has the funding it needs, not just for today to deal with the immediate challenges, but it is on a path to be able to provide high-quality public services into the future.   Updated at 12.32pm GMT    11.56am GMT  Sunak urges Northern Ireland executive to focus on 'things that matter', not constitutional change  Rishi Sunak has urged the new Northern Ireland executive to focus on “the day-to-day things that matter to people”, not constitutional change. Speaking to broadcasters, the PM refused to endorse Michelle O’Neill’s claim that a referendum on Irish reunification could be held within a decade. (See 11.22am.) Asked about the new first minister’s comment, Sunak said:  I had very constructive meetings this morning with the executive, with political leaders across Stormont, and it is a historic and important day for the country, because Northern Ireland’s politicians are back in charge, making decisions on behalf of their people, which is exactly how it should be. Now, our new deal gives them more funding and more powers than they have ever had, so they can deliver for families and businesses across Northern Ireland. And that’s what everyone’s priority is now. It is not constitutional change, it is delivering on the day-to-day things that matter to people.   Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.49am GMT  Ireland's neutrality and minimal defence spending poses 'grave back-door security risk to UK', rightwing thinktank claims  Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Féin president, is leader of the opposition in the Irish parliament and it seems likely that after next election she will be taoiseach, leading the government. Today Policy Exchange, a rightwing thinktank with good links to the UK government, has published a report claiming that Ireland’s neutrality, and its very limited spending on defence, poses a security threat to the UK and suggesting that, with Sinn Féin in power in Dublin, this problem could get worse. It says:  As well as proving a menace in the maritime domain, Russia – alongside China and Iran – seeks to degrade the UK and its allies through unconventional means. Cyber warfare, institutional espionage, and educational and economic infiltration are all subthreshold methods employed by these authoritarian regimes to destabilise the West. The combination of ROI’s [the Republic of Ireland’s] flimsy security and intelligence apparatus, unwillingness to acknowledge these threats, and soft border with Northern Ireland poses a grave back-door security risk to the UK. Adversaries are certain to target the ROI, due to its close integration into transatlantic economic and digital systems, membership of the EU, and self-imposed exclusion from multilateral security frameworks. There is already strong evidence of a subversive and illegal Russian, Chinese and Iranian presence across Irish society and sensitive institutions … As it stands, Sinn Féin is expected to win the ROI’s next election in 2025, a party which will be no friend to British interests. Sinn Féin’s long history of Anglophobia, and conflict with the British state and security services – as well as its opposition to Nato, Russian sympathies, and general anti-western sympathies – will obstruct any meaningful recalibration of security arrangements with the UK. If Sinn Féin wins in 2025, the UK is therefore looking at many more years of an uncooperative, and likely hostile, neighbour in the face of growing external threats.  Asked about the report in an interview with Sky News, Peter Hain, a Labour former Northern Ireland secretary, suggested this was an exaggeration. “The Irish government is going to want to be friends with the British government, whoever is in power, because of our close economic relationship,” he said.  Updated at 12.06pm GMT    11.22am GMT  Jeffrey Donaldson urges Michelle O'Neill to drop talk of border poll and focus on 'issues that really matter'  In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Michelle O’Neill, the new first minister, said she expected a referendum on Irish reunification within a decade. The Good Friday agreement says that, if it appears “likely” that people in Northern Ireland would vote to join a united Ireland, the UK government must hold a referendum. But the Safeguarding the Union command paper published by the UK government last week said that this was unlikely to happen for decades. It said:  On the basis of all recent polling, the government sees no realistic prospect of a border poll leading to a united Ireland. We believe that, following the restoration of the devolved institutions, Northern Ireland’s future in the UK will be secure for decades to come and as such the conditions for a border poll are unlikely to be objectively met.  In an interview this morning Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said that he did not agree with O’Neill about a referendum taking place within a decade and that she was wrong to raise the issue. He told Sky News:  I don’t agree with that at all. I think that Michelle O’Neill, instead of focusing on a divisive border poll – she says she wants to be a first minister for all, well that means the unionist community … Let’s move forward together. Let’s focus on the issues that really matter to people. They’re not interested in a divisive border poll.      11.09am GMT   When the Democratic Unionist party held the first minister post it smirked at Sinn Féin references to Michelle O’Neill, then the deputy first minister, being “joint first minister”. The posts are indeed joint, with equal authority, but the DUP brandished “first minister” as a talisman and reminder that it was the bigger party. Secure in supremacy, it rejected an offer to rename the posts joint first minister. With Sinn Fein now revelling in having Northern Ireland’s first nationalist first minister Sir Jeffrey Donaldson performed a smooth, blink-and-you-miss-it U-turn on BBC Radio Ulster on Monday when he referred to his party colleague Emma Little-Pengelly as “joint first minister”. Let’s see if O’Neill repeats the one-upmanship of Ian Paisley senior who used to refer to Martin McGuinness as “my deputy”.     10.54am GMT  British Muslims losing trust in Labour over its handling of Israel-Gaza war  Labour has much work to do to retain support among Muslim voters, a senior party figure has said as a poll suggested the party had lost a portion of its Muslim voter base over its handling of the Israel-Gaza war. Aletha Adu has the story.   Related: British Muslims losing trust in Labour over its handling of Israel-Gaza war       10.48am GMT  Northern Ireland at risk of 'further damaging cuts' because £3.3bn funding settlement not enough, NI executive tells Sunak  According to PA Media, Rishi Sunak opened his meeting with Michelle O’Neill, the new first minister, and Emma Little-Pengelly, the new deputy first minister, with the words:   It has taken a lot of hard work and indeed courage to get us sitting round this table. Today isn’t the end, it’s the beginning and the real work starts now.  It certainly does. The Safeguarding the Union package announced by the UK government last week included £3.3bn for Northern Ireland. But, in more or less its first decision since being revived as a result of that deal, the new power sharing executive has published an open letter to the PM saying that that sum is not enough. The letter says the current funding settlement “does not provide the long-term sustainability required”.  The financial package states that it will provide a ‘Welsh-style needs-based factor’ that will see future Barnett consequentials increased by 24% from 2024-25. Whilst in Wales this needs-based factor serves to guarantee that Welsh funding will not fall below its assessed level of need, applied from the wrong starting point, as proposed locally, will trap executive funding below need after the short-term funding is exhausted, potentially for decades. Scotland and Wales are both funded considerably above need, whilst this proposed approach ensures our public services will be consistently funded below need, under a ‘fiscal ceiling’. Whilst we recognise that the short-term funding provided through the financial package supplements and supports our near-term position, it does not provide the long-term sustainability required.  Specifically, the letter also says the executive needs more money for public sector pay. Under the current settlement, there is a risk of “further damaging cuts”, it says.  There is also a clear public expectation that the financial package will fully address public sector pay pressures. However, the reality is that the current package does not meet this expectation nor provide a sustainable solution. The £584m amount included for pay in the December package falls short of the known pressures of c£690m, which aim to broadly reach pay parity with GB, where industrial disputes are not yet fully resolved, and is for one year only. It is hoped that flexibility will be provided to use any of the £559m not required for debt repayments towards pay pressures. However, even this may not be sufficient. The recurrent cost of these pay awards will also put significant pressure on the executive’s finances. This means that the executive would be forced to make further damaging cuts to public services of the order of hundreds of millions of pounds next financial year and every financial year, in order to meet growing pay pressures.  In effect, the executive would be required to make decisions on whether to cut services or provide fair pay. As you will be aware these issues are interdependent and given the current deterioration of public services and level of industrial action, either option will be near impossible to implement and will cause further lasting damage to citizens, which will be difficult to reverse.       10.23am GMT   Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and vice president Michelle O’Neill, the first minister in Northern Ireland, have held talks with Rishi Sunak and Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, PA Media reports. PA says:  It is understood the Sinn Fein leaders objected to elements of the recent UK deal with the DUP amid concerns it adopted a pro-union approach to issues such as a border poll and the development of an all-island economy. The republican party is understood to have made clear its intent to drive an all-island economy through the economy and finance departments it now holds in the newly-formed ministerial executive in Belfast. They also are believed to have stressed the requirement for the UK government to remain impartial in relation to the calling of any future referendum on Northern Ireland’s constitutional future. The Israel-Hamas conflict was also spoken about, with McDonald understood to have stressed the urgent need for a ceasefire and the need for international rule to be upheld in the region.

It has suspended an assembly member, Justin McNulty, who vanished from Stormont’s first sitting on Saturday to manage a Gaelic football team. McNulty, who represents Armagh and Newry, slipped away early to steer County Laois to victory over County Wexford and missed his party leader, Matthew O’Toole, being nominated opposition leader. “We weren’t informed he was going to leave nor was permission sought,” O’Toole – a former Downing Street civil servant – told the BBC on Monday. “This was a decision we had to make.” Some in the party – and people in County Louth - have backed McNulty.     10.10am GMT  Sunak says, while he 'passionately' backs union, UK government will 'always respect constitutional nationalism'  In an article for the Belfast Telegraph published today, Rishi Sunak has said that, while he “passionately” believes in the union, the UK government will “respect the desire for a united Ireland” felt by nationalists. He said:  The agreement [announced last week] safeguards the union. Far from being neutral on the Union, I passionately believe in it, consistent with the principles in the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. Northern Ireland is stronger in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom is far, far stronger for having Northern Ireland in it. So I was pleased that the House of Commons last week passed legislation to affirm Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the UK. It was right to do so because without those new protections, we would have been unable to restore power-sharing. Of course, I recognise there are many people in Northern Ireland who do not share these views and have different political aspirations. The government will always give full and equal respect to constitutional nationalism and the desire for a united Ireland, pursued through peaceful and democratic means — just as we recognise that there are a growing number of people who do not define their aspirations by reference to one tradition or another.  This passage addresses concerns raised by the Irish government, and by the SDLP, a nationalist party in Northern Ireland, about language in the Safeguarding the Union command paper published last week seen as implying the UK government had weakened its commitment to allowing people in Northern Ireland a referendum on reunification if they want one.  Updated at 10.12am GMT    9.31am GMT  Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale says she voted SNP in 2019 Euro elections because she was 'mad about Brexit'  Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, has admitted she voted for the Scottish National party in a protest against Brexit in May 2019, in the last European elections involving the UK. Dugdale, who was Scottish party leader from 2015 to 2017 and was still a Labour MSP at the time, has long made clear her opposition to the UK leaving the EU. She has told a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Labour’s Scottish Challenge, she was “so mad about Brexit.” While that election was largely symbolic – the then prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating the UK’s departure, Labour lost both of its Scottish MEPs, including the country’s longest serving MEP David Martin. Dugdale’s switch mirrored defections by tens of thousands of Scottish Labour voters in 2019: the party recorded just 9% of the vote, its worst result amid a series of electoral humiliations at the hands of the SNP. She said:   I voted SNP once in my life and that was in the European Union elections immediately after Brexit, where I was so mad about Brexit. I felt I could vote for the SNP in that European Union election, because that in no way could be construed as a vote for independence.  Dugdale, who resigned as a Labour member when she quit Holyrood in July 2019 to become head of the John Smith Centre think tank at Glasgow university, insisted she had “voted Labour in every election since then”. Even so, the defection will harden suspicions amongst her Labour critics about her pro-independence leanings. Married to the SNP’s education secretary, Jenny Gilruth, Dugdale has acknowledged she could vote yes in a future referendum. She told the Edinburgh international book festival last year:  If you are presented with a binary choice between an independent Scotland in a progressive Europe or Little Boris Brexit Britain, I know where my cards would fall down. I also know I couldn’t argue with the same strength for the union that I did in 2014 now. That doesn’t mean I’m ready to vote yes; there are big, big questions we need to debate as a country and resolve.   Updated at 9.33am GMT    9.24am GMT    Updated at 4.38pm GMT    9.14am GMT  Rishi Sunak admits he has failed on pledge to cut NHS waiting lists  Good morning. Rishi Sunak is in Belfast today, where he is meeting political leaders, including the new first minister, Michelle O’Neill, and deputy first minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, and the taoiseach (Irish PM), Leo Varadkar. This is a (rare) good news story because, with his two revisions to the Northern Ireland protocol (the Windsor framework announced last February, and last week’s Safeguarding the Union tweaks and enhancements to the framework), and the DUP finally lifting its two-year boycott of Stormont, Northern Ireland can now move forward with devolved government in place and the Brexit disruption, if not over for good, at least receding. But Sunak will know that prime ministers never get any credit with British voters for achievements in Belfast, and so there is an equally important story in an interview he gave to Piers Morgan on TalkTV, being broadcast tonight. Sunak admitted that he has failed on his NHS waiting lists target. The fact that he has failed is not, of course, news. Last January as one of his five pledges, Sunak said: “NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly.” He did not say when, but waiting lists have been going up and so every assessment last month of how Sunak was doing on his pledges, like the Guardian’s, marked this down as failing. But getting a frontline politician like Sunak to admit a failure on this scale is another matter, and Morgan did make news by forcing the PM into an awkward moment of candour. Last month, in interviews on the pledges, Sunak claimed he was “making progress”. But when Morgan asked him about waiting lists, Sunak said almost the opposite: “We haven’t made enough progress.” The exchange went on: Morgan: “You failed on that pledge?” Sunak: “Yes, we have.” Morgan: “Because you said, NHS waiting lists will fall. In fact, they are slightly coming down now. But the waiting list is still nearly half a million more than it was at the start of last year. Do you accept that?” Sunak: “Yes. And we all know the reasons for that and what I would say to people is look we’ve invested record amounts in the NHS, more doctors, more nurses, more scanners. All these things mean that the NHS is doing more today than it ever has been. But industrial action has had an impact.” Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Rishi Sunak is due to meet Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly, Northern Ireland’s new first minister and deputy first minister, at Stormont. He is meeting Leo Varadkar, his Irish counterpart, too. Morning: Sunak is expected to hold a press conference. 2.30pm: Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s government does not merit a top performance rating, in the view of a senior cabinet minister. Asked during an LBC phone-in to rate her own administration’s performance in the style of a schools inspection report, the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, rated the government as “good”. That is the second-best rating on the four-point scale used by the education inspectorate Ofsted behind “outstanding”, and ahead of “requires improvement” and “inadequate”. Earlier, when asked to describe the overall performance of the Conservative government in a word, she said: “Delivering,” adding: “Usually, if I get more than one word, they’re not very kind words.” The phone-in host Nick Ferrari said: “Others might have another word for it, but there we are.” Keegan’s claim came on the same day the prime minister admitted he had failed to deliver his promise to cut healthcare waiting lists. Keegan was asked for the ratings in a segment of the show where she faced questions on the fairness of rating schools and other institutions with single-word judgments. Ofsted delivers the ratings as headlines, backed up by more detailed reports on performance in various areas, in its reports. Last month, an influential committee of MPs said the use of such judgments in Ofsted’s reports on schools in England should end. Members of the education committee said relations between the inspector and teachers had become “extremely strained”, with trust “worryingly low” after headteacher Ruth Perry killed herself last year following a traumatic inspection. Ofsted had downgraded Perry’s school in Reading from outstanding to inadequate, and a coroner called for changes to be made by the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in how schools are inspected. Asked to justify her own “good” rating of the government’s performance, Keegan said: “Often, a lot of the things that we’ve delivered nobody ever talks about … When you’ve gone from 68% to 89% ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ schools. When you’ve gone from no apprenticeship system to one that’s training 5.7 million people. I think you can look and say there’s a lot that has been achieved.” During her LBC appearance on Monday, Keegan acknowledged some childcare providers still did not know how much funding they would receive to make good on the government’s promise of 15 free childcare hours a week for two-year-olds whose parents are in work. Keegan said: “The vast majority of them have already but there’s a small number that haven’t and this is causing a bit of friction in the system. I am leaning on them very, very hard … I’m very confident in this programme. I’m very confident that your 15 hours for two-year-olds will be available in April.” Keegan apologised in September last year after being caught swearing on camera while expressing frustration about the crumbling concrete crisis in schools, claiming that “everyone else has sat on their arse” while she tried to fix the problem. In a seemingly unguarded moment after a TV interview, the education secretary was filmed lamenting that nobody had praised her for doing a “fucking good job”. After a series of challenging questions from the ITV News reporter Daniel Hewitt, Keegan said exasperatedly: “Does anyone ever say: ‘You know what, you’ve done a fucking good job, because everyone else has sat on their arse and done nothing?’ No signs of that, no?”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has acknowledged that he has failed to keep his promise to cut healthcare waiting lists. The prime minister made doing so one of the key commitments on which his own competence would be judged when taking office. But, with the situation in England actually worsening by many measures, the grand pledge was downgraded late last year, before Sunak then acknowledged failure on Monday. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.” The shadow heath secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “Rishi Sunak has finally admitted what has been blatantly obvious to everyone else for years – the Conservatives have failed on the NHS. “Where Sunak has failed, Labour will succeed in getting the NHS back on its feet. We did it before and we will do it again. We will cut waiting lists with 2 million more evening and weekend appointments, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status.” In October, it emerged that the number of people waiting longer than 18 months for NHS treatment in England was growing. Data analysed by PA Media last month suggested that, despite recent decreases in the waiting list in England, it was still higher than when Sunak’s pledge was made. The list stood at 7.21m outstanding treatments in January 2023. In November, NHS England figures showed 7.61m treatments were yet to be carried out. NHS workers, many of whom have seen substantial pay cuts in real terms under Conservative governments, have been exercising their right to take industrial action to secure better terms. Unions have consistently said ministers could avoid strikes by offering better pay deals. And government ministers have acknowledged privately they would end up needing to do so despite having spent months publicly insisting they would take no such step. Health leaders warned Sunak in December that allowing the industrial dispute to grind on would make delivering his pledge all but impossible. Nevertheless, Sunak sought to blame striking workers for his failure. Asked on Monday by TalkTV about the increased waiting lists in England, Sunak replied: “Yes, and we all know the reasons for that. And what I would say to people is: look, we have invested record amounts in the NHS: more doctors, more nurses, more scanners. All these things mean that the NHS is doing more today than it ever has been. But industrial action has had an impact.” Morgan also told Sunak about his 79-year-old mother’s experience with NHS care three months ago after she had a heart attack. The broadcaster said that, despite being driven to the hospital in an ambulance, his mother waited on a trolley in an A&E corridor for nearly seven hours before being seen, in a scene she compared to a “war zone”. The prime minister said the account was “shocking” and that performance in A&E and with ambulance waiting times were “not good enough”.  Interactive  However, he denied the Tories had failed the NHS since 2010, citing the backlog created by the coronavirus pandemic. “We can’t escape that. When you shut down the country in the NHS for the best part of two years, that has had an impact on everything since then. And we just have to recognise that reality,” he said. Also during the interview, Sunak accepted a £1,000 bet with Morgan that deportation flights to Rwanda would take place before the next general election, which is expected in the autumn. He has previously set the target of sending people who arrive in the UK via unauthorised routes, including those crossing the Channel in small boats, to the east African country by the spring. The UK has paid Rwanda £240m under Sunak’s plan to “stop the boats” – another of his five key pledges – and ministers expect to pay an additional £50m next year. But no one has yet been removed due to legal challenges that resulted in the supreme court last year finding the scheme unlawful. Sunak is trying to revive the policy by passing legislation deeming Rwanda a safe country and ratifying a new treaty with Kigali. The Rwanda bill is making its way through the House of Lords. After shaking hands with Morgan on the terms of the Rwanda bet, Sunak said: “I want to get the people on the plane. I am working incredibly hard to get the people on the planes.” The full interview is due to be shown on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube channel at 2pm and TalkTV at 8pm on Monday."

        "content": "Labour has much work to do to retain support among Muslim voters, a senior party figure has said as a poll suggested the party had lost a portion of its Muslim voter base over its handling of the Israel-Gaza war. Only 60% of British Muslims who backed Labour at the 2019 general election are willing to do so again at the next general election expected this year, the survey finds. Survation, which conducted the poll for the Labour Muslim Network, spoke to 682 Muslims across Great Britain and found that the Green party has attracted 14% of British Muslims and 9% willing to back the Liberal Democrats. More than 20% of Muslim voters remain undecided, giving Labour some hope. It is not only the party’s support among one of its loyal voter bases that has plummeted, Keir Starmer’s net favourability has dropped – albeit not as sharply – by 4 percentage points since 2021 and now sits at -11%. Starmer’s net favourability was worse in north-west England, at -18%, a region that features constituencies with a large Muslim voter base including Blackburn, Manchester (Gorton, Withington and Central) and Preston. Senior Labour MPs remain united behind Starmer’s efforts on the war, but have some concerns over being outdone by David Cameron, who was first to call for a sustainable ceasefire and last week said that the British government was considering recognising a Palestinian state. A Labour frontbencher told the Guardian: “Many voters I’ve spoken to in the area are furious with Starmer’s muddling position over his recognition of Palestine’s statehood. It hasn’t gone down well. Fortunately for Labour the anger isn’t quite at the peak of what it was in November, but ultimately people are still sore, so Labour has its work cut out for them.” As a result, British Muslims’ identification with Labour as their natural choice has fallen by 49 percentage points, from 72% in 2021 to 29% this year. On top of this, 85% of British Muslims believe the political position of parties on the Israel-Gaza war will be important in influencing their vote at the polls this year. The 2024 Survation survey was conducted via telephone, using a combination of landline and mobile phone; the same methodology was used for its 2021 poll for LMN in 2021, a year after Starmer took control of the party. In better news for Labour, 62% of British Muslims polled said their view of the Conservative party had become more unfavourable over the last year, with 38% believing Labour had become more distasteful within the same period. A year into his leadership, Starmer was warned not to take the Muslim vote for granted amid concerns about Islamophobia in Labour and the party’s stance on Palestine. Polling after a report into Islamophobia within the party was released in 2021 found that 55% of British Muslims did not “trust the leadership of the Labour party to tackle Islamophobia effectively” and 48% did not have confidence in the party’s complaints procedure to deal with Islamophobia. Anxieties within the community have also been raised over Apsana Begum’s status within the party, as the position of the MP for Poplar and Limehouse remains in limbo after a trigger ballot was launched in 2022 when she was signed off sick after a campaign of what she described as “misogynistic abuse and harassment”."

        "published_date": "2024-02-04T17:18:40+00:00",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak is facing fresh scrutiny over his government’s relationship with the IT firm Infosys, owned by his wife’s family, after it emerged that a minister told company executives he would “do what he could” to help grow its UK business. Dominic Johnson, a trade minister, discussed the UK operations of Infosys in a meeting at the company’s offices in Bengaluru in India, details of which were obtained by the Sunday Mirror through freedom of information requests. Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, has a 0.91% stake – previously valued at more than £500m – in her father’s Indian IT business and received dividends of £13m in the last financial year, helping to make Sunak reputedly the UK’s wealthiest ever prime minister. A readout of the meeting on 27 April last year said Lord Johnson “made clear that he was keen to see a bigger Infosys presence in the UK and would be happy to do what he could to facilitate that”. A “steering brief” for the meeting said it “would be good to reassure them on the prospects for the UK economy and remind them of the support that we can provide through DBT [Department for Business and Trade]”. This was reinforced in a list of speaking points, one of which said: “We value the relationship with Infosys and will continue to engage at a ministerial level when requested of us.” Labour suggested Infosys had effectively been granted “VIP access”, reminiscent of the VIP lane through which firms with contacts among Conservative ministers and government figures won lucrative deals to supply personal protective equipment (PPE) during the coronavirus pandemic. The shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Sunday Mirror: “After the Tories handed billions in taxpayers’ cash to cronies for duff PPE, the public will wonder why an outfit so personally close to Rishi Sunak appears to have been granted this VIP access. There are serious questions to answer.” The controversy is the latest in a series relating to his wife and Infosys to engulf Sunak. In 2022, when Sunak was chancellor, Murty agreed to pay UK tax on all her overseas income, but not on backdated income, after a row about her non-dom tax status. As a non-domiciled UK resident, she is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. The same year, Sunak faced accusations that Murty was collecting “blood money” in dividends because Infosys was still operating in Russia despite Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and Sunak calling for companies to pull out. The firm later said it was urgently closing its Moscow office. Last month, Murty donated her shares in the childcare company Koru Kids to charity, following concerns about whether she stood to benefit from government policies.  She took the decision after parliament’s standards watchdog concluded last year that the prime minister inadvertently breached parliament’s code of conduct by failing to properly declare his wife’s shareholding, which stood to benefit from a government childcare policy announced in the spring budget. Concerns have also been raised that Sunak’s family could stand to benefit financially from a post-Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) that he is negotiating with India, raising a conflict of interest. Infosys is known to want to improve access for its many thousands of contract workers through changes to the UK visa regime. The briefing paper for the April meeting said one of the objectives was to “reassure that the FTA will further create new opportunities and investor-friendly policies to support business growth”. Johnson outlined to the Infosys executives, whose names were redacted, advantages that could accrue to it through the existing high-potential individual visa scheme. A DBT spokesperson said: “The investment minister regularly meets businesses and international investors, including a range of Indian businesses, to champion the UK as an investment destination and secure commitments worth billions of pounds. “That engagement drives investment across the UK, creating thousands of high-quality jobs and boosting the UK economy.” Infosys was approached for comment."

        "content": "Britain faces a “backdoor” threat to its security from a Russian, Chinese and Iranian presence in the Republic of Ireland, according to a report by an influential thinktank that accuses Dublin of “freeloading” when it comes to European defence. The UK should also expand its air and naval presence in Northern Ireland, to counter a growing Russian threat on the UK’s western flank, according to the Policy Exchange report, which is backed by two former defence secretaries, Michael Fallon and George Robertson. The UK and Ireland are at risk from an “acute maritime menace” posed by a Russian doctrine of targeting undersea networks and pipelines and the presence of Russian warships, they say in a foreword to the paper. Concerns about Russian intelligence operations in Ireland and its vulnerability to cyber-attack are also highlighted in the report, which cites what it describes as an “inordinately large Russian diplomatic outfit in Dublin”. The embassy had 30 members of staff in 2022, which was more than many other European states with which Russia had closer ties at the time. Other evidence cited included Russian attempts to expand the embassy significantly, a move blocked in 2020 when the Irish government revoked planning permission on the grounds it was “likely to be harmful to the security and defence of the state”. China is another significant concern due to its rapid technological advancements and global influence. Meanwhile Ken McCallum, the director general of MI5, has said Iran stands out as the state that “most frequently crosses into terrorism”. UK authorities uncovered at least 10 potential threats last year related to kidnapping or harming UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime. It was an “unavoidable fact” that Ireland had “freeloaded” off the investment of others who were part of Nato, said the report, which added that this “home truth” had been admitted last year by the then taoiseach, Micheál Martin, as a discussion about Irish neutrality deepened. Discussions about neutrality among Ireland’s political classes have sharpened in the era of Russian aggression under Vladimir Putin, the arrival of Ukrainian refugees, incursions by Russian ships that are suspected of mapping underwater cables, and a 2021 ransomware attack by suspected Russian gangs on the health service. Ireland’s president has rebuked the government for launching a debate about the country’s longstanding military neutrality and the possibility of joining Nato, saying ministers were “playing with fire”. The report tried to sound an alarm bell about the consequences of Sinn Féin winning Irish elections in 2025. “If Sinn Féin wins in 2025, the UK is therefore looking at many more years of an uncooperative, and likely hostile, neighbour in the face of growing external threats,” it said. While Sinn Féin had been on the rise in the Republic and now holds the post of first minister in Northern Ireland, it has slumped in polls south of the border. Fallon and Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, welcomed the fact that Ireland had been reviewing its defence outlook – as Sweden and Finland have also moved away from neutrality – and called on the UK to encourage its neighbour to strengthen defences and build on a UK-Ireland defence agreement signed in 2015."

        "content": "The education secretary has admitted that she cannot guarantee the government’s pledge to provide new free childcare hours will be met on time as she is “not in control of all the bits”. Gillian Keegan said tens of thousands of businesses were responsible for delivering the 15 hours of free childcare a week for two-year-olds from April in England, expanding to 30 hours for children as young as nine months by September 2025. The Guardian revealed last month that the flagship scheme had been beset with problems, such as with the allocation of funding for nurseries and staff shortages, with the first phase due to start in just two months’ time. There were also technical issues preventing parents from accessing the code they need to get the support promised by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, in last spring’s budget. Ministers have found an 11th-hour “workaround” to address parents’ concerns about accessing the new free childcare hours, in an attempt to get a grip on chaos surrounding the scheme’s introduction. However, Keegan told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “Guaranteeing something in the future is something that you can never do. All you can do is put all the plans in place and then react if you need to. “I am really confident that all the things that we have done will mean that every parent who wants to have a place is going to have a place. “But what you are asking me is to personally guarantee something on behalf of tens of thousands of businesses that are working out there to grow the capacity and to make sure that we have got the people in place.” The former Tory education secretary Justine Greening said that delivering the extra hours would be “very challenging” but added that it would be a key test of the competence of Rishi Sunak’s government. Parents of two-year-olds who qualify for free childcare in April have been given an automatic code to allow them to access funded hours. But early-years providers said it would do little to address a staffing crisis that would limit the number of places available. Last week, the government launched a £6.5m-backed recruitment campaign to encourage people to work in early years just two months before the first phase of the expansion begins. A trial – which will take place in 20 local authorities in England from April – will also give new recruits and returners to the early years workforce a £1,000 cash payment shortly after they take up a post. But sector leaders and campaigners said the “Do Something Big” campaign had been launched too late and the proposals were “a drop in the ocean” compared with what was needed to support changes. Under the plans, working parents of two-year-olds will be able to access 15 hours of free childcare from April. This will be extended to working parents of all children older than nine months from September, and to 30 hours for these children within a year."

        "content": "On the fourth anniversary of Brexit last Wednesday, the business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, trumpeted its successes. “The British people’s conviction that the UK would excel as masters of our own fate has paid dividends,” she said, launching a report detailing the benefits. Among the top achievements listed were booming sales of honey to Saudi Arabia, surging pet food exports to India, a rush of UK pork, worth £18m over five years, heading into Mexico’s restaurants and homes, and UK beauty products sales leaping in China, thanks to barriers being smashed. “My department is leveraging our post-Brexit freedoms to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a business,” added Badenoch, seen by many Tory MPs as one of several flexing their muscles for a tilt at the leadership quite soon. But her triumphalist tone, and many of the assertions in the Department for Business and Trade’s (DBT) Brexit 4th Anniversary document, did not quite ring true with the industries cited. “I don’t know any of our members who export any great amounts [to Saudi Arabia],” said Paul Barton of the Bee Farmers Association, which represents professional beekeepers in the UK. “Speaking from the industry, we’ve not had any assistance from the government in exploiting [the Saudi Arabian] market, getting access into that market. So I don’t know where their increases come from.” He added: “I do remember years ago a chap, I think he was Kuwaiti or Saudi, just knocked on the door and bought a couple of buckets full of honey. I imagine he put it in his hand luggage.” People in the UK honey business seem focused on other issues. Of all the honey that is consumed in the UK, it is a worry that less than 10% is produced here, Barton said, with cheap Chinese imports making up the stiffest competition. As far as Brexit is concerned, a big issue is not so much exporting the end product to Saudi or anywhere else but importing queen bees, and on that, Brexit is proving more of a problem than a help. Queens are reared in southern European countries and brought to the UK so that farmers can begin their hives earlier in the season. But Brexit red tape means the bees are now subject to expensive and disruptive veterinary checks. As for the government’s claim that “a barrier resolution worth £550m to UK businesses over five years” has helped British beauty companies export to China, the barrier in question had nothing to do with Brexit, according to industry experts. In 2021, China relaxed rules on animal testing, which had been a big red line for UK manufacturers, making it easier to sell into their market.   Related: Brexit ‘shaved £850m off beauty industry’s exports to EU’   Millie Kendall, chair of the British Beauty Council, said the loss of trade with the EU outweighed the gains by a long way. “What we really want is to sell to Europe and the US. Economically, we’ve lost £853m in exports to the EU. Sixty-five per cent of our exports go to Europe – £550m sounds nice but it’s not even what we’ve lost.” One of Kendall’s members sent some products to Spain in August and they have still not arrived. Another, larger company has had to build a £1m warehouse in the EU simply to be able to distribute products. Most smaller companies have just given up, she said. For larger sectors, Badenoch’s triumphs seemed trivial, experts said. The business secretary’s announcement said officials had unlocked £25m of exports for medicines and £17m of new business in Colombia. “Together, these amounts represent less than 1% of the total value of the UK pharmaceutical exports of goods in 2022,” said Dr Jennifer Castañeda-Navarrete, a senior policy analyst at Cambridge Industrial Innovation Policy, based at Cambridge University’s Institute for Manufacturing. In 2022, 46% of pharmaceutical exports went to the EU. She warned that Britain’s previously thriving pharmaceutical sector was now in a trade deficit because we have to import so much more medicine than before – the latest 2022 figures show a $5bn deficit globally, compared with a surplus of $9.7bn in 2010.  A business department spokesperson said: “Many, including the Observer, forecast dire predictions for the UK economy after Brexit. As this document shows, those forecasts have been proven completely false. Of course there have been issues, nobody ever said it will all be perfect. “However, the report uses official statistics and many of the things people claim are down to Brexit are really down to Covid and supply chain issues. This report is intended as a useful corrective to the consistent doom and gloom about Brexit.” But the business department’s press release makes no mention of the problems suffered by small UK companies, which have seen their export markets hit and in many cases wiped out. In 2022, researchers at Aston University estimated that 42% of British products previously exported to the EU had disappeared from shops there. While large companies have been able to spend money on warehouses, vets, distributors, customs clearance, extra shipping costs and all the other red tape that arrived with Brexit, smaller ones have not.  Thomas Sampson, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said the top 15% of companies had not seen a drop in exports to the EU, but for smaller businesses, there had been a 20% fall. “It’s great that the DBT are working on removing market access barriers. But it’s all a little bit marginal relative to the seismic shock of leaving the single market and customs union,” Sampson said. “The big gains in the next five years will come by focusing on what’s happening with the EU and trying to simplify our relationship.” David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, said that the government’s fourth anniversary of Brexit document was “the usual set of claims that are in various ways slightly distorted”."

        "content": "Labour is planning only limited first-term reforms of social care and the House of Lords and a smaller green investment plan as part of a stripped-down general election manifesto, as it seeks to make its policies “bombproof” to Tory attacks. Shadow cabinet ministers have been given until 8 February to make policy submissions for the manifesto, as Keir Starmer’s party gears up for an election that, according to opinion polls, looks likely to return it to government for the first time since 2010. A committee of shadow ministers and officials will then assess which commitments will require legislation in a king’s speech that will be delivered within weeks of entering office. The party intends to have both documents ready by mid-March, in case Rishi Sunak calls an early spring poll. The Observer understands that as well as backing away from its £28bn a year commitment on green investment (while sticking to the overall drive to achieve clean energy by 2030), Labour will not seek to legislate on the creation of a new national care service in its first king’s speech. Instead, it will focus on a fair pay agreement for care workers as well as issues of recruitment and retention, as part of a wider workers’ rights bill. Its plans for a complete overhaul of social care will, however, be presented as a longer-term mission taking at least 10 years and two parliaments. In addition, despite Keir Starmer’s previous promises to abolish the Lords in a first term, it is expected to commit only to limited changes. This is likely to mean legislating only for the abolition of the remaining 91 hereditary peers. Labour’s cautious approach – which is frustrating some MPs and party members – is partly the result of uncertainty about the economic situation it will inherit and what can be afforded. But shadow ministers are also determined to offer as small a target as possible to the Tories on issues such as social care, which in the past have turned election campaigns upside down. In 2010, Labour’s care plans were branded a “death tax” by the Conservatives, and hit the party’s vote badly, while in 2017 Theresa May’s campaign suffered irreparable damage amid accusations she was planning a “dementia tax”. On social care, Starmer’s party has rallied the unions behind its more gradual approach. Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, told the Observer: “Care is in crisis and the need for a national service has never been greater. But the sector is complex and, with many thousands of care employers, creating a new system isn’t a five-minute job. “In stark contrast to the litany of broken promises from this government, Labour is committed to reforming care. Under the proposed fair pay agreement, wages will rise and care workers earn the same no matter where they work in England. “Care jobs will immediately become more attractive, and the sector be able to start filling the huge hole in its workforce. That will boost support to everyone needing care and begin to lift the pressure on the NHS.” With its green prosperity plan now being talked down, Labour’s new “flagship” policy is increasingly seen as its new deal for working people, which involves handing workers new rights from their first day of employment, as well as the abolition of zero-hours contracts. The deal, fiercely guarded by deputy leader Angela Rayner, also includes a ban on “firing and rehiring”. Another bill that is likely to be prioritised will be a “fiscal lock” that will force government to submit all tax and spending plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility for its judgment before pressing ahead. The aim is to contrast Labour’s commitment to fiscal discipline with the disastrous decision-making of the Liz Truss government, which caused near panic on financial markets. Elsewhere, Labour’s pledge to roll out breakfast clubs to every primary school in England, funded by the abolition of non-dom tax status, remains prominent in the manifesto. There are also hopes internally that a big childcare pledge could form part of Labour’s programme in a first term, with the party keen on expanding the number of nurseries attached to primary schools to tackle a huge shortage of places and staff. The former Ofsted head, Sir David Bell, is studying the issue for Labour, but is unlikely to report in time for an election before the autumn. The party’s pledge to raise more tax from private equity managers has also come in for scrutiny. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has vowed to raise the amount charged on profits they earn on deals, to match the 45p top rate of income tax. However, some in the party are said to be keen to water down the plan, fearful of deterring investment and denting Labour’s pledge to make the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of developed countries. Party sources insisted the plan remained to tax such profits as income. The manifesto will also make much of a pledge to build 300,000 homes a year – a target in the last Conservative manifesto that has not been achieved. Starmer’s willingness to take on those who want to prevent any building on “greenfield” sites is used by Labour insiders to show the Labour leader is willing to take on potentially difficult battles, rather than always take a cautious path."

        "content": "The elevation of Michelle O’Neill as Northern Ireland’s first minister is a historic moment that breathes new life into the republican slogan “tiocfaidh ár lá” – “our day will come”. The Sinn Féin deputy leader, a working-class republican, has taken charge of a state that was designed in 1921 to enshrine a unionist majority in perpetuity, and that the IRA vowed to destroy. Even in 1998, when the Good Friday agreement drew a line under the Troubles, it seemed inconceivable that the IRA’s political wing, the fourth-biggest party, would one day claim the top post at the Stormont executive.   Related: New Northern Ireland Brexit trade rules approved paving way for power sharing   But the Democratic Unionist party’s decision to drop a boycott of power sharing in return for an easing of post-Brexit trade arrangements means that O’Neill, 47, has belatedly become first minister in accordance with the 2022 assembly election, when Sinn Féin pipped the DUP as the biggest party. The former deputy first minister – a post with equal power but less prestige that the DUP will now occupy – has been sworn in amid the marbled grandeur of an edifice once regarded as a Protestant assembly for a Protestant people. It could appear that nationalism’s day has finally come. Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, this week spoke of a “historical turning of the wheel” and said Irish unity was “within touching distance”. Except it’s not. Political and demographic winds blow favourably but the republican dream remains distant. The party’s breakthrough at Stormont has symbolic and psychological force but does not signify a looming united Ireland. Paradoxically, O’Neill’s ascent could cement Northern Ireland’s position in the UK by restoring stability and confidence in the status quo. The region divides roughly into three camps: 40% nationalist, 40% unionist and 20% non-aligned who tend to favour staying in the UK. Some change is under way. In local elections last year, first-preference votes for pro-unification parties for the first time outnumbered those who backed pro-union parties and candidates. But a recent Irish Times opinion poll found that 30% would vote for unification in a referendum versus 51% that would vote against, with the rest undecided or inclined to abstain. Other polls have consistently shown a clear majority favour remaining in the UK, albeit with fluctuating margins. This has endured despite Catholics now outnumbering Protestants; despite Brexit, which most people opposed; despite crumbling public services; and despite the Republic of Ireland becoming wealthy, secular and pluralist. Sinn Féin has advanced not by attracting centrist voters but by cannibalising its nationalist rival, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP). The nationalist bloc is largely static and coalescing around one party while the unionist bloc is shrinking and more split, denting unionist parties but not necessarily their cause – a dynamic seen in Scotland. “I don’t think there ever will be a unionist first minister in Northern Ireland again. It’s over,” said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and authority on unionism. “It’s not that the union is over but the unionist state is over.” Tonge notes that O’Neill shuns the name Northern Ireland in favour of the “north of Ireland”, a jab at partition. “It’s astonishing that Sinn Féin can ascend to such electoral heights while still refusing to recognise Northern Ireland as a political entity.” The republican party will continue to lobby for a referendum, which only a secretary of state can call, and project a sense of inevitability about unification. But to sustain support – and to show voters in the Irish republic it can be trusted with power – it must focus on improving Northern Ireland’s economy, public services and infrastructure. To show, in other words, that the state it wants to abolish works."

        "content": "Northern Ireland’s devolved government has reconvened and appointed Michelle O’Neill as first minister in a historic moment for Sinn Féin and Irish nationalism.\nThe Stormont assembly nominated the County Tyrone republican as the region’s first nationalist first minister – and the first non-unionist executive leader since the partition of Ireland in 1921.\nO’Neill avoided triumphalism and made no explicit mention of Irish unity in an inaugural address that focused on reconciliation and bread-and-butter issues.\n“Wherever we come from, whatever our aspirations, we can and must build our future together,” she said. “We must make power sharing work because collectively, we are charged with leading and delivering for all our people, for every community.”\nThe appointment of a republican first minister represented “a new dawn” unimaginable to previous generations that grew up with discrimination against Catholics, said O’Neill. “That state is now gone.”\nO’Neill will jointly lead the executive with Emma Little-Pengelly, a Democratic Unionist who was nominated deputy first minister, a post with equal power but less prestige.\nThe devolved government reconvened after the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) walked out of Stormont on 3 February 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements that it said undermined the region’s place in the UK. The party agreed to end the boycott this week after its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, wrung concessions from the UK government that smoothed the so-called Irish Sea border.\nO’Neill, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader, became first minister in accordance with a May 2022 assembly election in which the republican party overtook the DUP as the biggest party, a seismic symbolic and psychological shift.\nThe former DUP leader, Edwin Poots, was elected as speaker by members.\nO’Neill had played down constitutional issues in the run-up to the sitting but earlier this week Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said Irish unity was now within “touching distance”.\nSinn Féin, the DUP, the Alliance and the Ulster Unionist party will share ministerial positions using the D’Hondt mechanism based on party strengths, with the exception of the justice ministry, which is decided using a cross-community vote. The Social Democratic and Labour party will form the executive’s opposition.\nThe executive faces a daunting list of problems including a fiscal crisis, crumbling public services and eroded faith in democracy.\nStormont’s restoration will release a £3.3bn package – including pay rises for public sector workers who have staged multiple strikes – that the UK government had made available, conditional on the revival of institutions set up under the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Donaldson said the parties would seek additional funding from the Treasury. “The finance piece is unfinished business which we intend to finish.”\nBusiness leaders and the Irish government have welcomed the return of power sharing, saying it should provide stability after years of Brexit-related convulsions.\nThe new rules to smooth trade across the Irish Sea were unveiled by the government on Wednesday. The measures remove routine checks on goods from Great Britain that are destined to remain in Northern Ireland and replace them with a “UK internal market system” for goods that remain within the UK.\nThe House of Commons approved the changes on Thursday without a formal vote, despite Brexiters’ concerns about the region remaining under EU law."

        "content": "Power sharing will return to Northern Ireland on Saturday after two years, with Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill making history as she becomes the first nationalist first minister. Here are answers to some of the key questions surrounding the historic event. What is happening at Stormont on Saturday? Members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) will return to Parliament Buildings in Belfast after a political impasse that has lasted for two years. Several previous attempts to restart the devolved government have failed since the 2022 assembly elections. This time the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has stated it will support the restoration of the power-sharing executive, which needs the support of the largest parties in unionism and nationalism to operate. This will end the deadlock, allowing a new speaker to be elected and clearing the path for parliamentary business to resume. Michelle O’Neill, of Sinn Féin, will be nominated as first minister, while a DUP MLA will fill the role of deputy first minister. The party has not yet confirmed who it will nominate, although speculation has suggested Emma Little-Pengelly could take the position. Then a series of ministers will be appointed using the D’Hondt mechanism, which measures party strengths. Ministers will be appointed to the departments of health, education, finance, economy, communities, infrastructure and agriculture, environment and rural affairs. A justice minister will also be appointed on Saturday, although the rules are different for this department as the minister needs to have cross-community support. Sinn Féin will be entitled to three ministries, the DUP and the Alliance parties two and the Ulster Unionists one. The Social Democratic and Labour party did not win enough Stormont seats to gain a ministry and will go into opposition.   Related: Michelle O’Neill: Sinn Féin leader from IRA family who has vowed to respect royals   What is different this time? At the 2022 assembly election, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party in Northern Ireland for the first time. This means their Stormont leader, O’Neill, will make history as the first nationalist first minister in the region’s history. The republican party has emphasised that this is a moment of significance, with the party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, stating that their ultimate goal of Irish unity is now within “touching distance”. However, under the rules of power sharing, the offices of first and deputy first minister, filled by the largest parties from the nationalist and unionist communities, have equal authority. All decisions are taken on a joint basis. What happens after Saturday? The business of governing Northern Ireland will begin. A first meeting of the executive will take place early next week followed by the first plenary session of the new assembly. Party leaders from executive parties have already met to discuss the immediate priorities to be addressed. Ministers will have bulging in-trays. Long periods without devolved government, combined with a series of budget crises in Stormont departments, have had a damaging impact on public services. As part of the negotiations that led to Stormont’s return, the UK government offered a £3.3bn package to stabilise Northern Ireland’s finances, including £600m to settle public sector pay claims. Ministers will be expected to begin making decisions quickly to alleviate some of the pressures facing public services. Why has there not been a devolved government for two years? During the Brexit divorce talks, the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, negotiated the Northern Ireland protocol with the EU to ensure the continued free movement of goods on the island of Ireland. However, this led to the requirement for checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and was deeply unpopular with unionists, who described it as an Irish Sea border. After feeling that Westminster was not responding adequately to his concerns, the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, collapsed the Stormont power-sharing institutions when he withdrew Paul Givan as first minister two years ago. In response, the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, negotiated the Windsor framework with the EU, introducing new rules on the movement of goods and a veto for the implementation of EU law in Northern Ireland. However, Donaldson insisted this did not go far enough, leading to months of protracted negotiations that have culminated in the command paper Safeguarding the Union, published by the government this week. Why has the DUP agreed to the deal? Donaldson has insisted the new arrangements have removed the Irish Sea trading border and restored Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market. The deal will end routine post-Brexit checks on goods shipped from Great Britain to final destinations in Northern Ireland, as well as introduce measures aimed at providing assurances around Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the UK. The DUP leader says this is the best deal that could be achieved for the people of Northern Ireland and it persuaded him to end the DUP boycott. He has long argued in favour of restoring devolved government, providing his concerns over post-Brexit trade and sovereignty were addressed. Does this represent a major change to the trading arrangements agreed with Brussels? It depends who you listen to. Donaldson says his party has delivered “fundamental change” to the Windsor framework by ending routine checks on goods moving from Great Britain to, and staying in, Northern Ireland. Downing Street, however, has insisted the measures unveiled on Wednesday and approved by MPs on Thursday do not require specific EU sign-off, characterising them instead as “operational” changes to the framework, without altering the “fundamentals” of the bilateral deal. Does anyone oppose the DUP leader’s move? Not everyone in the DUP supports accepting the arrangements. A meeting of the party’s ruling executive, where Donaldson presented the proposals to members, lasted for more than five hours on Monday night. He was ultimately able to secure the backing of the executive, insisting the margin of support was “decisive”, and the endorsement of the majority of his 12 party officers. However, just hours after the command paper was published on Wednesday, the senior DUP MP Sammy Wilson launched a scathing broadside against the government in the House of Commons, in a clear sign of the differing opinions at the highest levels of the party. The arch-Brexiter claimed the ongoing application of EU law in Northern Ireland was the result of a “spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying government, refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland”. On top of internal tensions, Donaldson faces criticism from some in the wider unionist and loyalist community. On Thursday night, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, Jim Allister, and a loyalist activist addressed a meeting of unionists and loyalists opposed to the deal. They have insisted the Irish Sea trading border has not been removed. On Friday, Allister a legal opinion commissioned by himself and others from Northern Ireland’s former attorney general John Larkin. Key among the questions asked of Larkin were whether the plans set out in the command paper would: restore the 1800 Acts of Union; remove a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea; and ensure “zero checks and zero paperwork” for goods from Great Britain destined for Northern Ireland. Larkin argued they achieved none of those objectives. However, Donaldson has rejected the findings of the legal opinion, stating that he “fundamentally disagreed” with it."

        "content": "It is just after noon on market day in Wellingborough town centre and the owner of the Fine Diner mobile burger bar, William Holden, is waiting for his next customer. The last stallholder has already packed up and left and the square is almost empty. On its walls are photographs of how it used to be in 1904, packed with traders and buzzing, in an age when Wellingborough thrived and sold shoes and boots to the world. When he voted Conservative in 2019 – to “get Brexit done” – Holden had hoped things would get better, that the town’s good times would return. “But I see very little that has changed,” he says. “Where are all the new hospitals? I don’t see them. Bills are up, and prices are up. And the boats are still a real problem. “I have people coming here at the start of the week buying a cup of tea and they say ‘I can’t pay you until Friday’. They are that short of money. It is not what I had imagined.” Asked how he might vote in thenext week’s byelection on 15 February, caused by the suspension of Tory MP Peter Bone over claims he bullied a former staff member a decade ago and exposed his genitals, he’s at a loss. “I am struggling to come up with an idea of who it will be,” he says. That is until the candidate for Reform UK, the new incarnation of the Brexit party, Ben Habib, a businessman and former MEP, swings by to deliver a chat about sending boats full of asylum seekers back to France, making sure Brexit is done properly, lowering taxes and cutting energy bills. “I am not saying I am convinced, but it is something to think about,” says Holden as he examines Habib’s campaign leaflets. Labour, which held Wellingborough (a constituency that takes in Rushden and surrounding towns and villages) from 1997 to 2005, is now odds-on to overturn the majority of more than 18,000 won by Bone in 2019, in what would be one of the more predictable byelection “shocks” of recent years, such is the extent of the Tory party’s recent descent. The circumstances of Bone’s departure and subsequent selection of his partner Helen Harrison as the Tory candidate to replace him, have left local people angry and disillusioned. “It leaves a really bad impression and looks bad for our town. A lot of people will not vote Tory again,” says David Smart, an 81-year-old pensioner who says he will choose Labour because “they can’t be worse than this lot”. But while a Labour win would spell even more trouble for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, so too would the prospect of a substantial advance for Reform UK. On the streets of Wellinborough most people have heard of Reform and many say they are toying with voting for it. Its HQ on Sheep Street is the most visible of any party. “In previous byelections I have helped with, most people did not really know who we were,” says Habib. “This time it is different. The recognition factor is about a hundred times higher.” It is possible, he says, that this new party, which is now hitting 10% in some national polls, could run the Tories close and even push them into third place.  Interactive  If that were to happen it would probably trigger greater Tory panic than another Labour win, showing the extent to which Reform UK could split the rightwing vote at the next general election, particularly if Nigel Farage comes fully on board. “I am getting a lot of thumbs up, a lot of pats on the back, I didn’t see any of that in the other byelections,” says Habib, who is also the party’s co-deputy leader. “The biggest challenge is that we have not got the armies of people that the other two big parties have got, we have not got the information on voting in different households that the others have got, but I think the way sands are shifting, it is game on. Anything could happen. People who are angry come out to vote. People who are angry vote for change. They are not going to come out and vote Conservative!” The Tories have clearly all but given up in this election. Tory MPs are refusing to campaign in Wellinborough for fear of being ridiculed and insulted, and because they think it would be a complete waste of their time. The party headquarters previously used by Bone was locked on Friday, showing no sign of life. In the window were posters of Harrison and her pledges, including those to “stop the boats”, “improve our NHS” and “fix our roads”. Parked directly outside was an abandoned car with a flat tyre that has been there so long that grass is growing on the bonnet and out of the boot. On the windscreen was a red DVLA notice, dated Friday, warning the owner of a potential £1,000 fine for unpaid tax. Liz Campbell, who lives opposite, says that since the furore over Bone’s suspension the office exterior has been daubed with pink paint. Wellingborough, she says, deserves better, someone who will champion local issues. She intends to vote for the independent candidate, Marion Turner-Hawes, who is battling to save trees which are under threat in the area. “Anyone but Peter Bone,” she says. In contrast to the Tories, Labour’s candidate, Gen Kitchen, a charity fundraiser who grew up in Northamptonshire, has canvassed with the help of about 100 Labour MPs over recent weeks, including Chesterfield’s Toby Perkins, who has been taking a lead political role. Perkins accepts that “Reform is taking a chunk of the vote” but believes that the Tories’ failings both nationally and locally put his party in with a serious chance. “A lot of people feel very let down by politics in general and nationally, but also locally around the area,” he says, referring not only to the Bone case, but also the effective bankruptcy of Tory-run Northamptonshire county council in 2018, as well other controversies. It is hard to find much Tory activity on the streets of Wellingborough on a Friday afternoon with just 13 days to go before the vote. But what literature the party is producing shows it recognises Reform is now a serious problem. A campaign newssheet being put through letter boxes warns that “Voting Reform could let Labour in”. A Reform UK worker said of the newssheet: “Before, in previous elections, they didn’t even acknowledge us. Now they are talking about us as a threat. That for us is a breakthrough.”"

        "content": "When Michelle O’Neill is sworn in as Northern Ireland’s first minister, it will be a moment of personal triumph steeped in irony. As a teenage mother, she was treated as if she had the “plague”, and wept, yet went on to ascend the ranks of Sinn Féin and is now poised to make history as the first nationalist to lead Northern Ireland – a state that, in theory, she wishes to eradicate. There is little expectation of republican thunder when O’Neill takes her post in the gilded chamber of Stormont on Saturday. She has pledged to be a first minister “for all”, unionists as well as nationalists, and to show respect to the royal family. Yet the 47-year-old comes from an IRA family, defends the legitimacy of IRA violence, and honours IRA members who died during the Troubles. How she navigates the tension between these positions will shape her tenure at the helm of an executive that faces immense challenges after two years of political paralysis. O’Neill should have become first minister in May 2022 after Sinn Féin overtook the Democratic Unionist party in an assembly election. But the DUP boycotted power-sharing in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements, leaving Stormont mothballed until a deal with the government coaxed it back this week.   Related: With Sinn Féin in first minister post, will republicans’ day have come at last?   The Sinn Féin deputy leader will head an executive with a DUP deputy first minister who has equal power but less prestige. The two parties, in coalition with Alliance and the Ulster Unionist party, inherit a fiscal crisis, crumbling public services, creaking infrastructure and widespread cynicism about Stormont’s capacity to fix things. Republicans will want progress towards unification, while unionists will want to anchor themselves in the UK. Solomon and Machiavelli might have passed up such a job as impossible, but O’Neill has professed optimism and keenness to “work together with all parties to deliver on the needs and aspirations of workers, families and businesses”. Sexist jibes will not help. Since entering the public eye as a minister and deputy first minister, O’Neill has had to field comments on her appearance. “The beauty from a family drenched in blood,” the Daily Mail declared in 2017. “Glossy blonde hair. Bright lipstick. Curled eyelashes. Painted nails. Figure-hugging outfits. Michelle O’Neill certainly isn’t what we expected.” When Arlene Foster was a DUP first minister, she was pressed in an interview to sum up her Sinn Féin colleague in a word. “Blonde,” she replied. If wounded, O’Neill did not show it. Her public persona is of an open, affable, down-to-earth politician who gets on with her work. Officials at Stormont say she is the same when cameras are not rolling. “No airs, easy to get on with,” said one. O’Neill’s background did not hint at a future hobnobbing in Washington, London and Brussels. She was born Michelle Doris into a working-class family in Clonoe, a village in County Tyrone. Her father, Brendan Doris, was an IRA prisoner and an uncle, Paul Doris, raised funds for the group. Two cousins, IRA members, were shot by security forces, one fatally. Aged 15, she became pregnant and recalled being treated at school “like I was a plague”. At home she collapsed and sobbed. “I’ll never forget that experience and I thought, ‘Nobody will ever treat me like this again,’” she told the Irish Times in 2021. O’Neill’s family helped care for her baby daughter while she completed her A-levels and trained as a welfare rights adviser. In 2005 she won a seat on Dungannon borough council that had previously been held by her father and went on to become a protege of Francie Molloy, a Sinn Féin assembly member, and Martin McGuinness, the party’s dominant figure alongside Gerry Adams. After she was elected to Stormont in 2007, the party hopscotched her over more senior colleagues by appointing her agriculture minister in 2011, health minister in 2015 and deputy first minister in 2017 after McGuinness’s death. “Initially she was seen as a puppet for Adams and the boys,” said Shane Ross, a former Irish government minister and author of a biography of McDonald, using a euphemism for IRA veterans suspected of behind-the-scenes influence. “But she has grown in stature. Her authority is growing. She’s certainly able enough.” O’Neill, now a grandmother, has reached out to unionists by attending King Charles’s coronation and occasionally referring to “Northern Ireland” rather than the “north of Ireland”. She has also accepted Police Service of Northern Ireland protection, a break with the Sinn Féin tradition of using republican bodyguards. But she defends the IRA’s armed campaign up to the 1998 Good Friday agreement, saying there was “no alternative”, and attends memorials for former members, including a large funeral in 2020 during Covid restrictions. “It’s hypocritical to go and shake hands with various dignitaries but not condemn the killing of innocent people who were just doing an honest day’s work,” said Roy Crawford, an Ulster Unionist councillor for Fermanagh and Omagh district council. An IRA bomb killed his father, Ivan Crawford, a part-time Royal Ulster Constabulary officer, in 1987. “Justice has not been got. The killers are running free,” he said. “I’m only one of many.” Still, the unionist expressed hope about Stormont’s restoration. “We are entering a new phase of history. We don’t know what the future holds for us. We hope it’s something tangible and positive.”"

        "content": "“Advisers advise, ministers decide,” goes Margaret Thatcher’s aphorism. But if Nadine Dorries is right, one Conservative adviser has the power to elevate and overthrow prime ministers and has been exercising it for two decades. Some might accuse Dorries of hyperbole. But even to more reserved figures in the Conservative party, the Tory fixer Dougie Smith is a mysterious and unnerving character. He has been employed in an undefined role under successive Tory prime ministers including David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Former colleagues who have encountered him in government describe feeling unsure what his job was and to whom he was answerable. Used to operating in the shadows, Smith now finds himself in the spotlight after reports he has been advising a group plotting to replace Rishi Sunak before the next election. “He definitely wants Rishi out,” one Tory insider said. It seems an extraordinary situation that someone who is apparently employed by the Conservative party is being accused of working to overthrow its leader. Tories’ answer to the obvious question – why doesn’t Sunak just sack Smith? – is that he has been around too long and knows where all the bodies are buried. Little information about Smith is publicly available. Though he has worked for the Conservative party since around 2002, there are no records of his education and employment history online and he does not appear on the government’s list of special advisers. A Telegraph profile in 2022 reported that he was born in an Edinburgh suburb in May 1962 and studied at the University of Strathclyde but dropped out before his final year. In Westminster, perhaps the most often-cited fact about him is that he reportedly organised swingers’ sex parties for wealthy clients in the 1990s and early 2000s. When this was exposed in a national newspaper, Smith insisted that his political and private activities “don’t overlap” and even boasted that his clients were like “the SAS of sex”. Asked about reports that Smith was now involved in a plot against the prime minister, Sunak’s press secretary told reporters on Wednesday: “There’s a lot of speculation around … All I can say in terms of the government side and what the PM’s focused on is that we’re getting on with the day job.” Conservative Campaign Headquarters was approached and said it did not comment on HR issues. In her book The Plot, Dorries claims Sunak is just the latest in a long line of Tory leaders Smith has targeted. Others who have worked with him say the reason he has been part of Tory furniture for so long – despite turnover at the top of the party – is that successive leaders have benefited from his political instincts and deep knowledge of the party and its membership. A former adviser in Johnson’s government said Smith’s status as a “legacy” figure in the party gave him authority in government. “He would dip in and out of things he was interested in,” they said. “He had that quite rare ability to walk into a room and have no one ask: ‘What are you doing here? What is your interest in this?’” One of his focus areas, according to the same aide, was helping Johnson avoid potential bear traps. “We’d be in a position where something could land the PM in shit and we’d need to sort something out. Then Dougie would appear and he would offer some views and some strategy.” Smith would also liaise with Tory MPs and he was for a time tasked with what the aide described as “Carrie [Johnson] management”. “In the early days when Carrie was having issues – which were broadly ‘there’s too much interest in me, how do I manage this?’ – he became her person for a while,” they said. Smith’s loyalty to Boris Johnson appears to have eventually waned. Dorries’ book includes an interview with Johnson who told her that in 2021 Smith called him and allegedly told him to resign because he was “poison like Nixon”.   Related: Thatcher was right: Tory moderates have no power over the party’s ruthless rightwing extremists | Andy Beckett   Smith’s wife, Munira Mirza, who worked as Johnson’s policy chief in Downing Street, quit in 2022, attacking Johnson’s unsubstantiated claim that Keir Starmer had allowed Jimmy Savile to escape justice while he was director of public prosecutions. Smith and Mirza are interested in social and cultural debates, including on race and gender. The Tory insider cited above said Smith was “obsessed with woke issues”. It is perhaps unsurprising then that he has been linked to Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary and Tory culture warrior, amid claims that the plotters want to make her party leader. A third former special adviser recalls suspicions during Johnson’s government that Smith was trying to get Badenoch installed as education secretary. “He and Munira saw education as a place to fight culture wars and push back against progressive, trendy stuff,” they said. If somehow Badenoch comes to replace Sunak with Smith’s help, one of the claims in Dorries’ book will come true. Or as the same adviser put it: “Maybe she’s not in the fiction section after all.”"

Sunak recalled the pain of hearing slurs directed at his younger siblings, adding that racism “stings” and “hurts in a way that other things don’t”. He felt what he experienced would not happen to his children now. Discussing his Indian heritage, Sunak said his parents were keen for him and his siblings – a brother and sister – to “fit in and not for it to be, in any way, shape or form, a barrier”.   Related: Political realities constrain Sunak over when to call an election   His mother, he added, was particularly conscious of how her children spoke. “One of the things my mum was obsessed with was that we didn’t speak with accents and we would speak properly,” he said. “So she was keen for us to try to do some extra drama.”  “I think any form of racism is simply unacceptable,” he continued, adding that when he speaks to world leaders, “most people look to the UK as an example of how to get this right”. Sunak admitted that he never dreamed there might one day be an ethnic minority prime minister “because you didn’t have role models like that. [It] hadn’t happened yet.”  The programme followed Sunak to key constituencies, watching him spend time with his family and in Southampton, where he grew up.

        "content": "For weeks, Labour officials have been locked in meetings as they try to figure out how to present Westminster’s worst kept-secret: Keir Starmer’s slow U-turn away from his pledge to spend £28bn a year on the green economy. Publicly, senior party figures insist that nothing has changed since last summer, when the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the party would spend £28bn only if the party’s strict fiscal rules allowed. But in private they admit that as it becomes clearer what kind of economy they would inherit should they come to power this year, the idea of actually hitting the target has become a pipe dream. Multiple frontbenchers and senior advisers confirmed to the Guardian this week that the target was now dead. “I can’t explain why someone in communications got stuck on the £28bn figure,” said one shadow minister. “It’s kind of meaningless if it’s not actually attached to planned investments for a purpose.” Speaking on Friday morning, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, appeared to confirm as much, saying the target would “move around” depending on economic conditions and the projects that needed funding. Officials insisted on Friday afternoon that Jones’s words did not signal an end to the £28bn “ambition”, as Starmer has termed it. But observers note that while Starmer continues to talk about the figure in public, none of the shadow Treasury team does. Asked 10 times on Sky News this week whether she backed the target, Reeves refused to use the number at all, saying instead: “The importance of economic and fiscal stability … will always come first.” Labour insiders insist there is no split between Reeves and Starmer on this key part in the party’s policy platform. “I’ve worked in split teams, this is not a split team,” said one senior adviser. Those close to Reeves point out that while Starmer is often asked about the environmental aspects of the plan, the shadow chancellor is usually asked to defend the spending. Nevertheless, some advisers, most notably Pat McFadden and Morgan McSweeney in Labour’s campaign team, want Starmer to say publicly that he is dropping the plan, while others argue that doing so would add to the impression he cannot be trusted. Officials say they are not anticipating a “clarification moment”, when Starmer would come out and say what he thinks the party is likely to borrow to fund green investment, given the state of the economy. However, if the Labour leader does decide to make a public statement on it, he would probably do so after next month’s budget. “We will see what the headroom looks like in March,” said one adviser. “There is not much we can say before that.” The problem with Labour’s current position is that the party is in the worst of all worlds. As long as Starmer continues to talk about £28bn, the Conservatives will continue to claim that Labour intends to raise taxes to pay for it, despite Reeves’s insistence this will not happen. But while the Labour leader defends what some of his most senior allies call a “meaningless” target, the party has allocated only about £10bn a year worth of projects on schemes including a publicly owned energy company and a home insulation plan. And with officials insisting these also remain subject to the party’s fiscal rules, some green activists worry they will soon be scrapped as well. Steve Coulter, head of economy at the Green Alliance, said: “This is not a story about an arbitrary number. It’s a fundamental question about the kind of future we want to live in. “Will Labour retrofit millions of homes, tackling fuel poverty and bringing down energy bills? Will they revitalise our automotive and steel industries, providing high-quality jobs and protecting our national security?” Senior Labour figures say that honing the commitment to focus solely on what has already been announced would boost the party’s green credentials. “It was always intended to be allocated before the general election, so this isn’t such a major departure really,” said one. “It’s being firmed up not dropped.” Shadow cabinet ministers are getting frustrated at the confused messaging. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, warned at a shadow cabinet meeting last month that the constant speculation was damaging policymaking more generally. Some say Sue Gray, Starmer’s chief of staff, was supposed to have resolved some of these disagreements in the last few weeks. Others say the blame lies with uncertainty on Starmer’s part. Meanwhile the Conservatives, riven by their own divisions on issues including immigration and tax, are watching on delighted. One senior Downing Street official compared it to Theresa May’s decision to reverse her manifesto commitment to overhaul social care in 2017 while insisting “nothing has changed”. Even if Starmer formally ditches the £28bn target next month, some believe it is too late to stop the Tory attacks on the policy. “I don’t know why they’re even bothering,” said one adviser to the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. “We’re just going to go on about £28bn even more.”"

        "content": "The defence secretary has awarded a near-£2bn contract to use artificial intelligence and virtual reality to keep British warships and submarines at sea for longer. Grant Shapps has announced a £1.85bn deal with the UK arm of defence and aerospace specialist Thales to provide technology services to the Royal Navy. The 15-year contract will support 450 jobs as technicians work to keep British submarines and warships at sea, amid heightened tensions over naval security as Yemen-based Houthi rebels attack ships in the Red Sea. The deal highlights the growing spread of AI in the defence world. As part of the deal, the technology will be used to analyse ships’ systems data and identify problems before they escalate. Virtual reality will also be used to allow technicians in Britain to guide operators overseas to carry out physical repairs. Concerns have been raised about the amount of time Royal Navy vessels have spent in port due to malfunctions or collisions, with Britain’s military strength under increasing scrutiny since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and escalating tensions in the Middle East. Last month, HMS Chiddingfold reversed into HMS Bangor off the coast of Bahrain. Under the contract, Thales will work on the ships’ sonar, masts, periscopes and the electronic warfare equipment that enables the navy to detect and target potential threats. It will also work on the sensors and sonar equipment on the continuous at sea deterrent, which has been in place since 1969 and means at least one nuclear warhead-armed submarine is always on operational patrol. Sources close to the deal said the technology could allow submarines to stay submerged for longer as they would not need to surface for repairs or to receive new equipment, a process that reveals their location. On a visit to the naval base at Devonport, Plymouth, Shapps said: “In a time of global instability, it is imperative we minimise the time our ships and submarines are out for maintenance.” Alex Cresswell, the chief executive of Thales in the UK, said: “This £1.8bn contract with Thales will help keep more Royal Navy ships at sea for longer, by harnessing the latest developments in artificial intelligence, data analysis and improved dockland facilities.” The UK business, which is part of the Paris-headquartered multinational Thales Group, holds a string of government contracts with the Ministry of Defence and Home Office. It designs satellite propulsion systems and has worked on the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. In 2019, it bought Gemalto, which holds the contract to make post-Brexit blue passports, for €4.8bn (£4.1bn)."

        "content": "A senior Labour frontbencher has all but confirmed the party has ditched its commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment, prompting warnings that the UK risks falling behind other nations in initiatives to tackle the climate crisis. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour would decide how much to spend on environmental programmes once it got into government, depending on the individual schemes and the state of the economy. Jones told Sky News: “The number that we will get to, if we are in government, will be subject to two things. “Firstly, it will be subject to the state of the economy. We know we’re going to inherit a bad economy from the Conservatives, but we have plans to turn that around, and of course, we hope to be successful doing that. But it will also be subject to case-by-case business cases that, if I’m the chief secretary to the Treasury in the next Labour government, I will have to sign off.” While one Labour official argued this was not a definitive ditching of the commitment, first set out in 2021, the comments mark the first time a shadow minister has publicly acknowledged the party is no longer targeting £28bn. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that the party leader, Keir Starmer, had decided to drop the commitment, which had become a totem of the party’s green ambitions but also a subject of repeated attack from the Conservatives. Jones said the amount spent “will depend on what the types of projects are, what the types of partnerships are with the private sector, and also our ability for the market, for our country, to deliver on those projects”. “The number will move around just as a matter of fact,” he said. “It will depend on the strength of the economy – we will only invest when it’s affordable – but also on a case-by-case basis working with the private sector.” Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, also later talked down the centrality of the £28bn target. Speaking during a visit in East Lothian with the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, she said: “It’s not about just throwing a figure out there willy-nilly, and saying we’ll just put that in. It’s got to be part of applying to our fiscal rules.” While insisting that Labour “want to ramp up to £28bn”, Rayner said that the party would not be hemmed in by “arbitrary” numbers. “We don’t even know what the public finances are going to be like,” she said. “We’re not just going to throw money out there.” Party officials have been discussing for weeks what to do about the £28bn commitment, which has been steadily scaled back since the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled it. Last year, Reeves said the target would be hit only in the second half of the parliament, and then only if the party could fulfil its economic promise to have debt falling as a share of economic output by the end of a five-year period. However, Andrew Simms, the director of the New Weather Institute thinktank, said a lack of ambition over such investment risked a UK “trapped with polluting, expensive, unhealthy and increasingly inefficient infrastructure, in everything from housing to transport and energy systems”. He said: “It means Britain will fall behind other nations and be more vulnerable to extreme weather events, energy price volatility and the health threats of global heating. “Worst of all, it will be a false economy, because the costs of not investing are catastrophically higher than climate-proofing the economy in a way that also pays for itself by lowering bills, creating jobs, raising air quality and improving environmental wellbeing.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the demise of the £28bn figure meant “Labour will fail to clarify for voters what they really stand for”. She said: “They risk leaving the door wide open for the EU, US and China to overtake us in the global green tech race. And they will provide few assurances about how high bills, freezing cold homes, toxic air pollution, and unreliable public transport aren’t just here to stay.” In recent weeks Starmer has continued to stick by the £28bn target, even while downgrading it from a “pledge” to an “ambition”.

        "content": "  4.40pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has said that, while the party would like to spent £28bn a year on green investment, it will not be bound by an “arbitrary” number. (See 2.58pm.) She spoke as it became increasingly clear that, while the party has not entirely stopped talking about the £28bn figure, it no longer regards this as a binding target for the amount of money it aims to spend every year on its green prosperity plan. Environmental experts have criticised this. Dr Anupama Sen, the head of policy engagement at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, which specialises in research into achieving net zero, said:   It is disappointing to see the Labour party water down this flagship policy due to short-term political pressures, at such a crucial time for climate action and leadership, especially with other countries racing to prepare their economies for the imminent green energy transition. It would be better to stand firm and make the case for this level of investment, which is that it would reduce our emissions and shield against increasingly volatile energy prices to give us genuine energy security. With the right mix of policies this could be achieved in a way that is fair for workers and for households.  And Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth’s head of policy, said:  We urgently need decisive leadership on green growth, not more of the same kind of flip-flopping and rollbacks we’ve seen from the current government, which has squandered the UK’s gains on climate and left us far behind in the global race to a zero-carbon economy. A collective political failure to see the huge economic opportunities of a fair transition would be both short-sighted and deeply damaging.

The committee recently visited the barge and, in a six-page letter to the Home Office posing questions raised by the visit, Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the committee, said she and her colleagues were concerned by conditions on the barge. On living conditions, she said:  We were disheartened to see some of the living conditions on the Bibby Stockholm, with many individuals having to share small, cramped cabins (originally designed for one person), often with people (up to 6) they do not know (some of whom spoke a different language to them). These crowded conditions were clearly contributing to a decline in mental health for some of the residents, and they could amount to violations of the human rights of asylum seekers.  On mental health support, she said:  Given the recent and tragic suicide of an individual residing on the barge, we would hope that the Home Office is taking all suitable steps to ensure mental health support is available to all those residing there, including access to mental health services that can act immediately when a report is made. It is concerning that, in our short visit, many asylum seekers expressed mental health concerns. It was alarming that one asylum seeker told a member of the delegation that they had had thoughts of suicide as a result of having to reside on the barge. Although we were assured that the relevant safeguarding team would work with this particular individual, we are extremely concerned about the apparent lack of mental health support for those on the barge.  And on whether the Bibby Stockholm was like a prison, she said:  Although asylum seekers are not formally detained on the barge, there are strict rules requiring residents to regularly inform staff about their whereabouts. Organisations that work with asylum seekers have said that “for those on board, the Bibby Stockholm feels like a prison”. We heard similar stories from asylum seekers who shared their experiences with us during the visit.  In a statement issued alongside the letter, Johnson said:  We are concerned that housing asylum claimants on Bibby Stockholm is leaving them in a claustrophobic environment, isolated from external support including legal advice and without important links to community, faith or family potentially for months on end. The government must not forget that those seeking asylum could have experienced severe trauma. They are vulnerable young men who will be in need of critical help. There needs to be readily accessible assistance available to deal with the medical and mental health consequences of what they have been through. Support services on the barge must be adequate to meet the needs of those housed there, and if not that there are practical steps in place to allow them to be accessed in the wider community.

She said a lot would depend on the state of the public finances. Speaking on a trip to Scotland, where she was visiting the Glenkinchie distillery in East Lothian alongside the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, she denied there was confusion around the Labour policy. She said:  It’s not about just throwing a figure out there willy-nilly, and saying we’ll just put that in. It’s got to be part of applying to our fiscal rules. This is about identifying where that money will be spent, and when, how quickly we can get that off the ground in a sustainable way to secure the public money and secure that three times the amount of private investment. They’re the rules that we’re applying to that money. Therefore it’s arbitrary to say, well every year it will be £28bn by immediately the first day. We don’t even know what the public finances are going to be like.  Asked again whether the party was abandoning the £28bn target, she replied:  No, we’re saying that we want to ramp up to £28bn. But we’re not just going to throw money out there. The fiscal rules that Rachel [Reeves, the shadow chancellor] has applied to that money is that it has to be about investment in jobs of the future as part of our industrial strategy.

(See 9.34am.) The Labour leadership has ruled out the idea, but one Labour MP has just published a book making the case for a wealth tax and the Greens might be surprised by who it is. Liam Byrne has never been seen as one of the party’s leftwingers. A former management consultant, who was chief secretary to the Treasury when Gordon Brown was prime minister (where, as a joke, he wrote that note), and now chair of the Commons business committee, he has just published The Inequality of Wealth: Why It Matters and How To Fix It. Most of the fixes he recommends don’t involve higher taxes, but he does call for “a tax code that actually reflects a moral code” and this is what he says about a wealth tax. He describes approvingly proposals from the Wealth Tax Commission. And he goes on:  [The commission] proposed that tax be levied on an individual on a one-off basis, each year, for five years, and the basis for taxing included all property. Assets would be valued based on their open-market value. However, householders would have the right to challenge the valuation. For those without cash to hand, payments could be deferred by those who are ‘asset-rich-cash-poor’, and some measures would be needed to reduce unnecessary hardship. [The big conclusion from Arun Advani, one of the commission leaders] was that there is virtue in setting a high threshold for those who are levied. Why? Because this gives tax authorities a small number of people to survey, who can therefore be surveyed in a great deal of detail and precision. As Arun explained to me, ‘They already have accountants and whoever else, so their stuff is fairly well managed already.’ And the fruits could be extraordinary. A 1% tax on everyone with assets of more than £10m could bring in between £10-£11bn a year. And what is even more intriguing is the level of political support for the idea. In a poll conducted in late 2022, Prof Ben Ansell found that a wealth tax ‘was significantly more popular than other ways of raising revenue across all taxpayer groups’. Well over half (56.3%) of people agreed with the statement that we should have a net wealth tax on the wealthiest, and the idea was three times more popular than raising the top rates of income tax. Reforming wealth taxes, or taxes on the wealthy, will be hard. For Conservatives, tax in general, and low tax in particular, has become almost sacred, a defining part of the creed. However, down the ages from the Plantagenets to the Victorians – tax strategy has proved critical to national strategy. There is no ‘grand strategy’ for any country without a strategy for collecting and sharing the harvest. And if we want to build a wealth-owning democracy in the twenty-first century, we cannot avoid the argument on tax – but we should no underestimate the political battle.  But Byrne argues that the argument for a wealth tax can be won. He says:  As Brooke Harrington [a sociology professor] told me, in a world where norms change faster than laws, it may be perfectly possible to harness our basic psychology to build support for paying taxes, much as the campaign group of high net-worth Americans called the ‘Patriotic Millionaires’ have shown. Their line, ‘patriots pay their taxes’, is frankly one of the best lines I have seen in politics anywhere. Brooke argues that we cannot beat tax avoidance by simply changing laws. ‘I don’t think you can fight them on that terrain,’ she told me. ‘Any new law you might throw at them will be unsuccessful because they have more money than you do. They have more time than you do. They can do this all day. And you can’t. So does that mean you can’t win? No. You just have to fight on a different terrain.’ We have to appeal to their thirst for respect and dignity – and their fear of shame in being exposed as avoiding their dues.  The Inequality of Wealth is an excellent book. I was expecting it to be packed with analysis and policy, but a bit dry, but in fact it’s got plenty of colour, narrative and history too; think of a Resolution Foundation report rewritten as a Guardian long read. It is also a welcome antidote for anyone despairing about the absence of radical thinking in Labour’s mainstream.      2.04pm GMT   The former Post Office boss Paula Vennells and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will give evidence at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry when it resumes in April, PA Media reports. The next phase of the inquiry will look at governance, redress and how the Post Office and others have responded to the scandal.  Updated at 2.31pm GMT    1.13pm GMT   No 10 has, in effect, dismissed claims by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson that there will be “joint” Sinn Féin and DUP first ministers after Stormont returns. (See 11am.) Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, will become first minister as leader of the biggest party after the power-sharing assembly returns. It will be an historic moment for Irish republicans and nationalists but one that will horrify some unionists and loyalists. Asked about Donaldson’s claims, a spokesperson for Rishi Sunak said he was aware of the reports but added:  I think that’s a matter for Jeffrey Donaldson and Michelle O’Neill. The roles of the executive have been set out very clearly in the Good Friday agreement.  Earlier, the spokesperson said the prime minister believed there will be “relief and hope” in Northern Ireland. He said:  It’s over to the first and deputy first minister elect to show leadership and tackle the immediate challenge that people in Northern Ireland face.  Asked about Donaldson’s other comment that he believed Northern Ireland will end up receiving more than the £3.3bn provided for by the UK government in December as part of moves to re-establish power sharing (see 10.46am), the spokesperson said:  We’ve set out a very generous and significant package as part of this deal and it has all been published in the command paper that was published at the beginning of the week.   Updated at 1.16pm GMT    12.49pm GMT  SNP says Labour's decision to drop £28bn green investment target 'deeply damaging' for Scotland  The SNP says Labour’s decision to drop £28bn as the annual target for its green investment plans will be “deeply damaging” for Scotland. In a statement, Drew Hendry, the party’s economy spokesperson in Westminster, said:  This latest U-turn by Sir Keir Starmer, which mirrors the economic negligence of the Tories, is a deeply damaging move that threatens jobs, investment and economic growth in Scotland – at a time when it’s needed more than ever … When the EU and US are ploughing ahead with investment, it makes no sense for broken Brexit Britain to pull the rug from under Scotland’s energy industry. £28bn is the bare minimum – we should be investing more, not less, to drive growth and reap the rewards.   Updated at 1.12pm GMT    12.30pm GMT  No 10 insists UK does send migrants back to Turkey, as it plays down reports that formal returns deal is unlikely  Downing Street has played down claims that it has given up hope of securing a returns agreement with Turkey. (See 11.18am.) Asked about the report, the PM’s spokesperson said:  We do, and can, return people to Turkey. There’s been no changes to the arrangements we have between the UK and Turkey. We announced a strengthened migration partnership with Turkey last summer.  Asked whether there are plans for a more formal returns deal, the spokesperson said:  Formal return agreements are just one of the many levers we’ve got at our disposal. And we do, and can, return people to Turkey.  He argued that Turkey was a safe country.

PA says:  The Times said that ministers’ hopes for a returns deal, along the same lines as the current agreement with Albania, has collapsed after an internal review said Turkey was “a state that does not meet the criteria of being ‘generally safe’”. Rishi Sunak and other leading Tories have hailed the Albania deal as a key success in the prime minister’s bid to stop small boats crossings in the Channel. But it now appears a similar agreement with Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is unlikely to happen. The proportion of Turkish nationals arriving in the UK on small boats jumped from 2% in 2022 to more than 10% last year. According to the paper, the Home Office review found that an analysis showed 99% of Turkish asylum cases to the UK were based on “a fear of the state”, with the document also critical of the country’s “over-zealous” use of anti-terrorism law and the independence of the courts. A Home Office spokesperson said: “International cooperation plays a crucial part in tackling illegal migration and the UK and Turkey are close strategic partners, with a future-focused relationship. “Where an individual has no legal right to be in the UK, we will seek to return them to their home country. Protection claims are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our international obligations – no-one who is found to be at risk of persecution or serious harm will be returned.” Sunak has made his pledge to “stop the boats” central to his premiership. More than 1,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel.  In his story for the Times, Matt Dathan says:  Notably, the assessment also raises concerns over Turkey’s compliance with adverse rulings from the European court of human rights (ECHR), which the Home Office assessment said “raised questions about adherence to the rule of law”. This is significant given Sunak’s plans not to comply with interim injunctions from the same court. His Rwanda bill will give ministers the power to ignore these so-called Rule 39 orders despite the president of the ECHR saying last month that this would be a breach of international law.   Updated at 11.51am GMT    11.10am GMT  Government’s £6.5m early years plan for England a ‘drop in the ocean’  A £6.5m recruitment campaign to encourage people to work in the early years sector as the first phase of the government’s childcare expansion plan has been branded “too late” and a “drop in the ocean” by sector leaders. Jamie Grierson has the story.   Related: Government’s £6.5m early years plan for England a ‘drop in the ocean’    Updated at 11.52am GMT    11.00am GMT  Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill will be 'joint first minister', Donaldson suggests  When Stormont returns tomorrow, MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) will nominate ministers for the power-sharing executive and Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, will become first minister as leader of the biggest party. This will be a historic moment because it will be the first time a nationalist has been appointed to lead a country historically dominated by unionism. Some unionists are horrified by the prospect, not just because of Sinn Féin’s commitment to reunification, but because for many years the party was just seen as the political wing of the IRA. In his interview on BBC Radio Ulster this morning, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would view O’Neill as “joint first minister” rather than first minister. When it was put to him by Stephen Nolan that he was taking his party back into the executive with a “Sinn Féin nationalist first minister”, Donaldson corrected him, saying “with a Sinn Féin joint first minister, incidentally”. The DUP will nominate the deputy first minister and, under the power-sharing rules, the first minister and deputy first minister have joint authority; they have to approve key decisions together. But, symbolically, the first minister has higher status. When DUP figures held the post in the past, the party never referred to them as being “joint first minister”.  Updated at 11.53am GMT    10.46am GMT  DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson says state of NHS was 'big influence' in persuading him to resume power sharing  Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, has suggested that the poor state of the NHS in Northern Ireland was a factor in persuading him to take his party back into power sharing. The DUP has been boycotting Stormont for two years, principally because of its opposition to the post-Brexit trading rules for the region. A deal announced this week has addressed those concerns, and the Northern Ireland assembly is now set to reconvene tomorrow. In an interview with with the Nolan Show on Radio Ulster this morning, Donaldson said the state of the health service was also a big factor in persuading him to take his party back into the executive. With the executive not sitting, public services in Northern Ireland have been losing out because ministerial decisions were not being taken. Talking about the important of the executive meeting again, Donaldson said:  As a unionist, I believe that the union will be secured when every person in Northern Ireland believes that this place works for them. That covers a whole range of areas. It covers the health service. The health service is really struggling at the moment. That, I have to tell you, was a big influence upon me. When I listened to, engaged with, my own constituents on the real difficulties, the real life difficulties, that ordinary people are facing at the moment with the health service, we must make this an absolute priority.  Donaldson said all the other parties in Northern Ireland agreed with him that investing in the NHS should be the number one priority for the revived executive. The UK government has said £3.3bn will be available for Northern Ireland when the executive is restored. Donaldson told the programme the DUP believed Northern Ireland needed more. He said the settlement only included money to cover public sector pay awards for a year. He said the Northern Ireland parties should be pushing for extra. Asked if he thought Northern Ireland could end up receiving more than the £3.3bn, Donaldson replied: “I believe we will.”  Updated at 11.55am GMT    10.21am GMT   Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI director general, has welcomed Labour’s approach to business as set out yesterday at the party’s business conference. In an interview with LBC, she said:  It was great to see Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer clearly setting out that they absolutely want to work in partnership with business were they to be in power, which of course is great news for us. Reeves in her speech set out that, were she to become chancellor, she would set up a corporate tax roadmap within the first six months, which I think is really important and something that the CBI has long been calling for. She set out that corporation tax wouldn’t rise from where it is now and importantly, that any changes in our overall tax mix would really take into account how competitive we are in global markets so that if other countries move, the UK will move to follow suit. And I think that is what we want to see.  Asked about the £28bn green investment pledge, Rain-Smith said: “It didn’t sound like they were dropping that commitment.” (She needs to read the Guardian.)  Updated at 11.56am GMT    10.09am GMT  Senior MP confirms Labour has dropped £28bn target for green investment  In his Sky News interview this morning Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, confirmed the party has ditched its commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment schemes if it wins this year’s election, Kiran Stacey reports. Jones said:  The number that we will get to [for green investment], if we are in government, will be subject to two things. Firstly, it will be subject to the state of the economy. We know we’re going to inherit a bad economy from the Conservatives, but we have plans to turn that around, and of course, we hope to be successful doing that. But it will also be subject to case-by-case business cases that, if I’m the chief secretary to the Treasury in the next Labour government, I will have to sign off.  Here is Kiran’s full story.   Related: Senior MP confirms Labour has dropped £28bn target for green investment    Updated at 11.57am GMT    10.04am GMT  Treasury minister claims Labour isn't dropping £28bn green spending targets because its clean energy mission depends on it  The Conservative party has responded to reports that Labour has dropped its target to get green investment up to £28bn a year, by insisting that it hasn’t. Labour is still committed to its clean energy mission, its plan to deliver “a cheaper, zero-carbon electricity system by 2030”, and the Tories are saying that this will require investment of £28bn a year. In a statement issued this morning by CCHQ, Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said:  Labour are now trying to pretend they never said their 2030 energy policy would cost £28bn a year, despite repeatedly saying that their 2030 policy costs £28bn a year. Labour are resorting to this desperate dishonesty because they cannot say how they will pay for their 2030 spending spree as they do not have a plan. Everyone knows they will end up having to raise thousands of pounds of taxes on working people to fill their £28bn black hole.  In its news release, CCHQ has included various quotes from Labour shadow cabinet ministers implying the party set £28bn a year as a target because that was the sum needed to achieve the clean energy mission. For example, it quotes Kerry McCarthy, the shadow climate change minister, telling parliament in February last year:  We will invest £28bn per year to tackle the climate emergency through our green prosperity plan, which will allow us to insulate 19 million homes within a decade; to deliver a clean power system by 2030 ….  But the CCHQ news release also quotes Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, telling Sky News this morning that the two targets were not as closely linked as the Tories were implying. He said:  Just a little clarification, so the £28bn came from some academic research which looked at the level of ambition an incoming government should have to reach net zero by 2050, not the mission for energy security, clean energy power by 2030. They’re slightly different targets.   Updated at 11.59am GMT    9.34am GMT  Green party calls for wealth tax to fund green investment programme  The Green party is calling for a wealth tax to fund a green investment programme. Here is another extract from the statement issued by Carla Denyer, the Green party’s co-leader, criticising Labour for dropping the £28bn a year target for green investment. (See 9.19am.) She said:  A different approach through tax reforms, in particular by introducing a wealth tax on the super-rich, could help pay for the green transition. There is more than enough money in the economy to pay for this. Indeed, the Green party would go further and faster, investing at least double what Labour originally pledged, so we can turbo charge the transition to a green economy.  Greens recognise that investing in a green future will provide people with economic, social and environmental security. By decarbonising industry, insulating buildings, and ramping up renewable energy infrastructure, the UK can drastically reduce emissions, cut household bills and create new, good quality, well-paid and secure jobs in every corner of the country.       9.19am GMT  Labour accused of ‘massive backward step’ over decision to drop £28bn green investment pledge  Good morning. After weeks of uncertainty about its future, the Guardian is reporting that Labour’s plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment projects is definitely set to go.   Related: Labour to ditch £28bn annual green investment pledge, party sources say   That does not mean Labour is giving up on its green energy mission. But the £28bn a year figure had become a liability, because the Tories repeatedly depicted it as a gateway to higher taxes, and so that particular feature of the policy is being dropped. But Labour has not actually announced this. The Guardian story is based on information from party sources, and it has not been officially confirmed. On the Today programme this morning Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor said that, when he sought to stand it up, he was told by one figure in the party the story “shouldn’t be seen as any more authoritative than all the other speculation there has been on this”. Having decided to drop the £28bn target, Labour now has to decide how to announce this. There are two options: a hard, sharp U-turn, that gets widely noticed, while looking humiliating; or a soft, gradual U-turn. Labour has been embarked on the latter for a while (the £28bn policy has already been subject to various revisions watering it down), but the attacks from CCHQ have not stopped. The big danger for Labour is that, by closing down a line of attack from the right, they are opening one up from the left. And the Green party has obliged, describing the U-turn as “massive backward step”. This is what Carla Denyer, the Green party’s co-leader, said in a statement about the Labour policy released yesterday.  Just as the president of the British Chambers of Commerce calls on the next government to make the transition to a green economy its number one priority, Labour decides to shred their £28bn green investment plan. This is a massive backward step – for the climate, for the economy and for jobs. This U-turn will push businesses into taking their investment elsewhere – especially to the EU and US where green investment plans are being rolled out – and threatens thousands of potential exciting new job opportunities. The UK’s future prosperity is dependent on greening our economy and that requires large-scale investment. While the Tories have broken Britain and left the country’s finances in a dire state, Labour can choose whether or not to have this “fiscal inheritance” as a millstone around their neck … Investing in this secure future is a political choice. By ditching its green investment plan, and making a series of other U-turns, Labour has clearly signalled that it is turning its back on a fairer, greener future. It is clear we are going to need a group of Green MPs in parliament after the next election pushing whoever forms the next government to do the right thing.  Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: MPs debate private members’ bills. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Late morning: Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, joins Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, on a visit in Edinburgh. Midday: The political parties in Northern Ireland are meeting to discuss the restoration of power sharing, possibly as early as tomorrow.

        "content": "Michael Gove was lobbied by the firm that became the single biggest recipient of PPE contracts through the VIP lane in 2020 in the weeks before it was awarded the first of a series of deals worth £680m, new emails reveal. Emails released by the government show Gove, then a Cabinet Office minister, had a phone call with a founder of Unispace, an office interior design firm, on 24 March 2020 – the day after the first national lockdown was announced. Unispace was at that point controlled by the Australian businessman Gareth Hales – who is the son of the global leader of the Plymouth Brethren Christian sect, Bruce D Hales – and another church member, Anthony Hazell. Firms linked to Plymouth Brethren figures overall won more than £2bn of UK testing and PPE contracts during the pandemic, the Open and Candid blog has calculated. The Plymouth Brethren Christian sect has about 50,000 members worldwide and follows a doctrine of separation from the outside world. The emails show a “founder” of Unispace, whose name is redacted, spoke to Gove and followed up with an email later that day outlining his offer, and saying he was “praying fervently for all men and for you and the Conservative party at this difficult time”. After another email, Gove replied: “Thank you [name redacted], we will follow up!” Gove’s office subsequently forwarded an email from the Unispace founder to the office of Matt Hancock, the then health secretary, which directed the request through the Cabinet Office’s Covid inbox. The Cabinet Office said Unispace also approached the government’s commercial function with a second offer in mid-April, and this is what led to it getting put into the VIP lane and subsequently winning the £680m of contracts. The first contract, worth £239.6m, was awarded on 20 April with another worth £114m awarded a week later. The Cabinet Office stressed that ministers made no decisions on procurement during the pandemic. The government refused to be drawn on how Gove had come to speak to Unispace’s founder directly at the height of the pandemic, and whether they had been corresponding on the minister’s private email account. The correspondence, with names redacted, was obtained by the Good Law Project. The Cabinet Office describes the source of Unispace’s referral as “GCF COVID-19 Enquiries mailbox, Cabinet Office”. GCF refers to the Government Commercial Function, a cross-government procurement network. Ministers were not involved in the decisions to award contracts to firms placed in the VIP lane, but the process has been criticised for making it more likely that firms with contacts among Conservative ministers and government figures won lucrative deals. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “Unispace directly contacted the Government Commercial Function who referred the offer to the High Priority Lane. Ministers had no involvement in these procurement decisions. “In the height of the pandemic, we had to act swiftly to procure PPE, competing in a global market where demand massively outstripped supply. “Potential suppliers often passed on offers of PPE to MPs, civil servants and ministers – and these offers were then passed on to professional procurement specialists for assessment, with due diligence carried out on all companies in advance of procurement and every company subjected to the same checks.” The revelation also adds to the links between Gove and several recipients of the most controversial deals processed through the VIP lane during the pandemic. He was behind the referral of David Meller, a Conservative donor who had personally backed his leadership campaign. Meller’s design firm won six PPE supply contracts worth £164m. Gove was also mentioned in correspondence from Michelle Mone to another Cabinet Office minister in which she was offering to supply PPE “through my team in Hong Kong”, saying “Michael Gove has asked to urgently contact you”. Mone is subject to a National Crime Agency investigation and Lords standards commissioner investigation over the supply of PPE. Unispace won £680m of PPE contracts between April and August 2020. It was controlled by Hales and Hazell, before the design business of the company was sold to a Hong Kong buyer and the PPE contracts were transferred to another firm called Santé Global LLP in 2021. Santé Global, whose partners include Gareth Hales and another brother, Charles Hales, is now in dispute with the UK government over another contract to provide lateral flow tests, which it says was wrongly terminated. One of Santé’s advisers has been Mark Fullbrook, a Tory strategist and the former chief of staff to Liz Truss, although it is understood he is not currently retained by the firm. Santé Global did not reply to a request for comment."

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-01T21:29:24+00:00",
        "content": "Simon Danczuk, the former Labour MP who was suspended from the party for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl, is standing in the Rochdale byelection for the Reform party. He looks likely to face George Galloway, another former Labour MP, who said he would stand on a pro-Palestine ticket to “teach Starmer a lesson”. Labour’s candidate is Azhar Ali, the leader of the Labour group on Lancashire county council, who has called for an “immediate” ceasefire in Gaza, going further than the Labour leadership. The byelection will be held on 29 February after the death of Tony Lloyd last month. Labour decided to hold the contest as quickly as possible to “ensure a vacuum isn’t created for George Galloway and his circus of division”, as one party insider put it. Danczuk, 57, was Labour MP for Rochdale from 2010 until 2017 but was blocked from standing in the snap election called by Theresa May in 2017 after a series of lurid tabloid scandals. The final straw for Labour high command came in 2016 when he was exposed as having sexted a teenage dominatrix who “sold her toenail clippings for £10”. The teenager in question had apparently contacted Danczuk about a job in his office as she was interested in a career in politics. Talking on Thursday from Rochdale’s Baum pub, Danczuk said the portrayal of him as a “sex shame MP” was “absolute nonsense, a tabloid creation”. He added: “The real reason that I wasn’t allowed to stand for Labour in 2017 is because I was, as described by the Financial Times, Jeremy Corbyn’s fiercest critic.” Describing himself as “old Labour”, he said that the party under Keir Starmer had gone from “work to woke”. He said Reform’s policies appealed more to him, particularly “stopping the boats and illegal immigration and coming out of the European convention on human rights”. Danczuk hopes his record as a campaigner against grooming in Rochdale will stand him in good stead in the contest. Last month an independent review found that the police and local Labour-run council left vulnerable young girls “at the mercy of their abusers”. In 2012 he spoke out about the racial element of a series of sex-grooming cases in Rochdale, in which gangs of Asian men were found guilty of exploiting vulnerable white girls. In November that year, he gave a speech in parliament in which he outed Cyril Smith, Rochdale’s Liberal MP for 20 years, as a prolific paedophile. Danczuk said he joined Reform three months ago with no particular aim to be an MP again but that “the stars aligned” for him to return to Rochdale. He still has a home in the Greater Manchester town, where he stays when seeing his teenage sons. But he lives largely in London now, with his new wife, Claudine Uwamahoro, a beauty therapist from Rwanda. Standing as an independent in the 2017 general election he polled just 883 votes to Lloyd’s 29,035. Galloway came third in a byelection in Batley and Spen in 2021, polling 21.9% of the vote in a brutal contest in which his supporters were accused of aggression and intimidatory tactics."

        "content": "Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are ditching Labour’s flagship policy pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, party sources have said. The sources said the party would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as already announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company, and a mass home insulation programme. But it will in effect cut its green ambitions by about two-thirds, given that the previously announced schemes are set to cost just under £10bn a year by the end of the parliament.   Related: UK needs ambitious green plan to keep up with allies, says Labour frontbencher   The change, after a spate of recent government attacks portraying the £28bn figure as a likely tax rise, has been pushed for by key figures around Starmer including Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s director of campaigns, and Pat McFadden, the party’s campaigns coordinator. In a series of media interviews after speeches by Reeves and Starmer to a conference in London attended by hundreds of business executives, the shadow chancellor was repeatedly asked about the £28bn figure and declined each time to back it. Asked 10 times during an interview with Sky News, Reeves said of the plan: “I think what people need to know is that the fiscal rules are the most important thing for me … I know the importance of economic and fiscal stability and that will always come first.” One shadow minister said: “The £28bn is definitely going as a figure. It will be changed to specific outcomes linked to specific investment, rather than being a random figure to be allocated at a later date.” In a sign of how Starmer is likely to frame the decision, the source added: “It was always meant to be formally allocated before the general election, so this isn’t such a major departure really. It’s being firmed up, not dropped.” While scaling back the green prosperity plan has been under consideration for some weeks, dropping the £28bn annual target, unveiled with great fanfare by Reeves at the Labour conference in 2021, would be politically risky for Starmer and his team. Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, and his team still argue strongly for sticking with £28bn for environmental and political reasons. Senior Labour sources insisted, however, that Miliband had signed up to the idea of dropping the £28bn figure while sticking to the schemes that had already been announced. Polling released on Thursday by More in Common found that among people planning to vote Labour, the £28bn pledge is the second most popular potential manifesto promise, just behind abolishing tax breaks for private schools. Of the 3,000-plus panel, 79% said they thought the next government should increase investment in tackling the climate crisis, with two-thirds saying this should be a priority. Luke Tryl, of More in Common, said: “Labour might think that they are demonstrating fiscal prudence by dropping the £28bn climate investment, but our research shows that the investment remains a high priority for Labour voters and ditching it could well backfire.” Another source of frustration for many MPs has been the incremental abandonment of the target, with the risk that voters will think Labour has dropped it only because it has become a source of Tory attacks. One shadow minister said: “Good to drag this out as long as possible – very clever people.” The move comes after Reeves told the business conference that Labour would not raise corporation tax above its current rate of 25% during the next parliament. A day earlier she said the party would not reinstate a cap on bankers’ bonuses if it wins the next election."

        "content": "It was the hottest gig in town. Within hours of the event being announced all the £1,000-a-head tickets had gone. Thank God for those uncapped bonuses. Anyone who was anyone in the business world was here. Executives from Goldman Sachs, Google, Mastercard, HSBC and countless more besides. Not because they especially wanted to be there. More because they were desperate to not miss out on being there. There were FTSE 100 bosses in tears not to have made the cut. This was an event like no other. Twenty-first century Britain at its most postmodern. Its most meta. For the importance lay not in what anyone might say, but in that it was happening at all. No one had come to hear anything of real interest. Or to be informed or entertained. That was very much not the point. Rather it was a celebration of a marriage. One that had started as an arrangement but had developed into love. And mutual trust. A day to luxuriate in one another. A wellness spa for the soul. And not a little self-congratulation. Welcome to Labour’s second annual business conference. The first – still quite grand – was a much smaller affair in Canary Wharf. Thursday’s event, in a cavernous executive suite at the Oval cricket ground, felt far more corporate. Those who had bought the premium tickets on tables nearer to the front. The media excluded from many sessions. And the breakfast bacon baguettes. Though there was some continuity. The freebies of branded pen and notebook looked like they had been repurposed from last year. Maybe Labour had bought a job lot. A good investment. Five years ago all this would have been an impossibility. Back then, Labour was perceived as a bad joke to business leaders. Positively dangerous even. The idea of them cosying up to one another would have been anathema to both groups. Now they can’t get enough of each other. The Public Displays of Affection becoming increasingly X-rated. Soon they will need their own Only Fans profile. Now it is the Conservatives who are seen as toxic. Tory ministers may like to repeat their tired mantra that they are the party of business, but that’s not how the corporate world sees it. They have had enough. Only the odd debt collector and insolvency firm would sign up for a Tory business conference these days. First a Brexit most of them didn’t want and from which they are still trying to recover. Then a Liz Truss budget that crashed the economy and sent interest rates rocketing. Now a Rishi Sunak government dedicated only to futile efforts to ensure its own survival. And still the Tories don’t get it. Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, celebrated four years since Brexit with a tweet saying: “People said we would fall off a cliff”. Was that really the bar? How tin eared can you get? We haven’t fallen off a cliff. Bring it on! It also helps that there is almost no one in business who doesn’t think Labour will win the next election. So business gravitates to where the power is. No one wants to waste time schmoozing a bunch of losers who aren’t going to be around to alter any economic outcomes.   Related: Labour stresses stability and no surprises as it courts business leaders   But Labour has been an open door since Keir Starmer changed the party. No one has actually gone as far as repeating the Peter Mandelson line about being “intensely relaxed about people becoming filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes” but it’s more or less implicit. Perhaps with a tad more corporate responsibility on the side. Labour is not just happy to meet business halfway, it will go as far as is required. So business doesn’t just see Labour as a threat neutered but as a genuine opportunity. After a meet and greet breakfast session with Anneliese Dodds, the conference properly got under way with a brief introduction from Angela Rayner, who managed to awkwardly cram in four crap cricket gags into her opening few sentences. She said she felt completely at home in her surroundings, but she didn’t sound wholly convinced. Almost as if she needed more stardust to fully believe she was there. Maybe she was a hologram. Then came a few words from the day’s lead sponsor. Step forward Erin Platts, chief exec of HSBC Innovation Banking. I literally have no idea what she said. Or rather I do, because I did manage to stay awake. Just. Must have been why they didn’t feed the media beforehand. But Platts’ sentences just merged into each other, never properly making complete sense. Perhaps this is how you get to have a stellar career in the City. Fluent in something, if not English. But she seemed quite chipper and optimistic about something. Life. For the main attraction we got the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. She too started off somewhat awkwardly, as if she was nervous. Weird, because she’s far brighter than most of the people who were in the room. But after a few minutes, she hit her stride and you could feel the entire room breathe deeply and relax. She began to talk about her “securonomics” and it was like being bathed in liquid Valium. You could sense all the tension dissipate as you blissed out into a semi-conscious trance-like state. This is the effect chancellors are meant to have. They aren’t there to be funny or to show off their brilliance. They are there to do the grunt work of the important, boring stuff so the rest of us can get on with our lives. We’ve had enough of attention-seeking chancellors fucking things up. We don’t want to be up half the night wondering what Jeremy Hunt or his half-witted side-kick Laura Trott might do next. Every time Jezza appears in public, he inspires panic. A man so clearly out of his depth. Reeves is totally at home in this environment. She lives and breathes it so we don’t have to. The audience seemed to love her. She was one of them. She wasn’t going to inflict new traumas on them. The closest she came to committing news was to say she would cap corporation tax at 25%. Hardly the biggest of deals, but that’s the way the City likes it. Not someone hopping up and down like an out of control Duracell bunny changing his mind on tax cuts. We still didn’t learn if the £28bn green energy was a goer or not. But time will tell, I guess. Then the media were led away as the roundtable sessions took place behind closed doors. Almost certainly nothing of any interest happened. And after lunch, Starmer gave another honeyed-toned address to close a few more eyes in slumber. “You might not like this,” he said as he talked of workers’ rights. But they did. Of course they did. Starmer doth protest too much. Everyone is in this marriage together. The boat that cannot be rocked. So everyone left happy. Blissed out. Labour was in its heaven. As was the City. And the bonuses were in their pockets."

        "content": "Labour has readmitted an MP who was accused of bullying her staff after she apologised for her behaviour. A Labour spokesperson said on Thursday that the party had restored the whip to Christina Rees, the MP for Neath, who has been under investigation for more than a year after complaints about her were made by several of her staff. Rees apologised for her behaviour and announced she would not stand again at the next election – though she had already been barred from selection as the Labour candidate for the new seat of Neath and Swansea East, which will swallow up most of her existing constituency. Rees said in a statement: “Following the conclusion of the Labour party’s investigation into my conduct, I would like to make clear that I fully accept the outcome of the party’s process and offer an unreserved apology. I can also confirm that I have reviewed the findings of the investigation and taken a number of steps to ensure that my future conduct is of the highest standard. “I am pleased that I have been able to resume my party membership and, following a conversation with the chief whip, have had the Labour whip restored today. I would like to take this opportunity to announce that I do not intend to seek re-election. I will, of course, continue to do everything to serve my constituents until the general election.” A party spokesperson added: “Christina Rees is once again a full member of the Labour party and has regained the Labour whip.” Rees, who was shadow Welsh secretary during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party, lost the whip in October after several members of staff made detailed allegations about her behaviour, which they said were backed up with evidence. One person told the Guardian that the alleged bullying had been going on for years. While Rees is able to sit as a Labour MP again, nine others elected on a Labour ticket remain suspended or expelled by the party, with some investigations having been open for more than a year. They include Corbyn, who was suspended in 2020 for his response to a scathing report on antisemitism in the party under his watch. Rees was married until 1999 to Ron Davies, who resigned from Tony Blair’s government after he was mugged at knifepoint at a well-known gay meeting place on Clapham Common."

        "published_date": "2024-02-01T19:09:04+00:00",
        "content": "The Home Office has sought an emergency cash payment of £2.6bn after unforeseen expenditure on hotels for asylum seekers. James Cleverly has made a formal request for the money after a shortfall last year, when Suella Braverman was in charge for more than 11 months. The request, made late in the financial year, has concerned Diana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs select committee. She plans to write to the home secretary to ask why the costs of housing asylum seekers was not included in the department’s main estimates. The additional cash request has emerged in a written statement as the latest figures show that the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats last month was up 13% compared with the same time last year. In the written statement, Cleverly said the “net cash requirement for the year exceeds that provided by the main estimate 2023-24”. He added: “Parliamentary approval for additional resources of £2.6bn will be sought in a supplementary estimate for Home Office. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at £2.6bn will be met by repayable cash advances from the contingencies fund.” The overspend, which compares with a total budget of about £20bn, follows a £1bn overspend in the last financial year. Whitehall sources said the extra cash was spent on hotel rooms for asylum seekers, during a period when the numbers being housed in hotels exceeded 50,000 for the first time. Johnson said: “The home affairs select committee has raised the issue of missing asylum funding from the department’s main estimate during the course of the year; it appears that this shortfall has now resulted in an emergency cash requirement of £2.6bn. “I’m concerned that this additional cash requirement has arisen at this point in the financial year. To avoid this happening again, from now on the Home Office must include within its main estimate its best forecast for asylum expenditure. I’ll be writing to the home secretary to request further information and raising it when this is debated in parliament.” Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “The Tories have completely bust the budget of the Home Office through staggering incompetence and chaos but the taxpayer is paying the price. “The overspend this year is significantly worse than last year despite all Rishi Sunak’s promises. Their failure to clear the asylum backlog, end the use of hotels for asylum seekers stuck in their broken asylum system or sort out proper contracts has left them with an eye-watering £2.6bn black hole that the British taxpayer will need to fill. Time and again they go for gimmicks rather than ever getting a grip.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Financial advances through contingencies funds are planned for each year to enable departments to deliver services with unpredictable final costs, such as the asylum system. This is a routine request and will enable the Home Office to continue to keep the public and the UK’s borders safe.” Provisional Home Office data shows 1,335 people arrived in the UK from France via small boats in January, compared with the official figure of 1,180 recorded in January 2023. The total for January 2024 is just slightly lower than the number of arrivals in the first month of 2022. This week Downing Street said there were “variations” in the number of crossings but it was “too early to say what the trend is for this year”, when asked whether Rishi Sunak was on track to achieve his pledge to “stop the boats”. The prime minister’s official spokesperson made a similar assertion on Thursday, adding: “On the rolling 12-month stats we’re still down significantly and there is a great deal of work going on with our French counterparts.”"

        "content": "There was an elephant in the room as hundreds of business leaders gathered at the Oval cricket ground in south London to hear Labour’s pre-election pitch to captains of industry on Thursday. The opposition party had made much of its plan to sweep away zero-hour contracts and reverse many of the Conservative government’s employment laws in recent months. But it was barely mentioned at the conference until Keir Starmer fleetingly declared in his speech that not everyone was likely to be on board.   Related: Labour’s pro-business lullaby sends movers and shakers into a blissful sleep | John Crace   Starmer said it was a key part of “levelling up workers’ rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades”. The policy received a mixed reception. One senior business executive, who asked to remain anonymous, was uncertain about the promised employment laws giving staff greater protection. “There is an intent, but still very little detail, so it is something where we don’t really know the knock-on effects,” they said. A director of an energy company said that while most of his employees were on high wages and generous terms of employment, they used contractors who might be affected. But Peter O’Driscoll, the managing director of the parking app RingGo, said it would have no effect on his business, which mostly employs specialist technology workers and complies with the high standards set by its main partners – local councils. “We are part of a group run out of Sweden and it’s safe to say the main business has much higher standards than the UK already,” he said. Helen Brocklebank, the head of the lobby group Walpole, which represents 250 luxury brands including Burberry and Aston Martin, said her members were unlikely to be affected. “Our members employ highly skilled people who are valued in the way Keir Starmer talked about,” she said. More than 400 executives attended Labour’s conference, which provided a succession of shadow ministers for an eager audience keen to find out what is in store from the opposition before the general election this year. A morning breakfast with the shadow City minister, Tulip Siddiq, set the tone, with some of the biggest beasts in the financial sector on the panel talking about how Labour could overcome the instability and uncertainty caused by Brexit and the prospect of four UK prime ministers in as many years. Brioche rolls stuffed with sausages and bacon were served to accompany Siddiq’s speech, in which she spelled out how Labour would seek to boost the City and promote the financial sector more broadly. Small but tasty portions remained the theme for the rest of the day, and not just in relation to the food. Speeches were kept short, with plenty of time for questions at the £1,000 a head conference. Rachel Reeves’s commitment to cap the level of corporation tax at 25% was followed by some challenges to her plans for £28bn of green infrastructure investment. She stuck by the pledge, but in terms that meant it could be watered down if Jeremy Hunt spends all the Treasury’s spare cash in his budget next month. Sponsored by the financial data provider Bloomberg, and with Microsoft, Google and the heads of all the leading business lobby groups in attendance, there was a big company theme at the conference. Against the backdrop of the cricket pitch, the National Grid chair, Paula Rosput Reynolds, interviewed Starmer after his speech and the question of the £28bn green investment pledge was raised again. Starmer joked that it was Reynolds’ company that was going to take the UK towards an electric future and he should be asking questions of her. In the time left for audience participation, Starmer was pointedly asked what he would do for small and medium-sized firms, but while he lauded the efforts of owner-managers, it was clear his need to boost the economy would rely on seismic shifts in investment that only the major corporations can deploy. Dan Hogan, a director of the communications firm Blakeney, said many of his clients were energy companies and feared the £28bn pledge would be rolled back. “But the message of stability and certainty if Labour comes to power is one they will like,” he said. O’Driscoll said he was at the conference to check with Labour’s transport team that a government plan to develop a national charging scheme that brings together parking and EV charging would be embraced. Like so many projects under the current administration, it won’t be finished before the election and would need the approval of a future Labour government. “It’s a huge project that will be a big step forward, if it can continue,” O’Driscoll said. The evening ended with a party for 200 ambassadors and investors who were expected to be offered wine and beer, but not champagne. Maybe Labour’s budgeting in opposition is much as it would be in government."

        "content": "Harriet Harman has called on Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak to agree on ensuring that the general election campaign is not marred by threats of physical violence to MPs. The chair of the Commons standards committee, which oversees MPs’ conduct, has reiterated her call for a speaker’s conference committee to finally convene and address MPs’ safety or risk “colluding with the notion that MPs deserve to be denigrated or abused”. “This needs to happen now,” Harman said. “All party leaders must meet to agree to ensure the campaign isn’t marred by threats. The responsibility for ensuring that MPs are able to get on with their work lies not with them as individuals or their party or the government. It lies with parliament.” MPs across the political spectrum and the country have urged the government to reconsider deploying trained armed police at fearful MPs’ constituency offices, at least when the parliamentarian concerned is holding a surgery.   Related: Mike Freer on quitting as MP: I narrowly avoided David Amess killer   On Thursday the justice minister Mike Freer announced his intention to quit parliament after facing a “constant string of incidents” that he said included death threats, abuse and narrow escapes. On Christmas Eve his constituency office in Finchley and Golders Green was the target of a suspected arson attack. In 2021, Freer escaped the MP David Amess’s murderer by a “stroke of luck”, as the killer had been to Freer’s constituency “several times, armed with the intention to harm”. Freer has been wearing stab vests and using panic alarms ever since. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, whose sister Jo Cox was killed in 2016, said: “Sadly it’s not at all surprising that Mike is stepping down. He’s not the first and I’m sure he won’t be the last MP or person in public life to step down as a result – partly or wholly – of threats, abuse, intimidation and actual violence. “Elected people should take responsibility for their words and actions, the media and social media companies have a crucial role to play, particularly around misinformation and disinformation, and we also need a much more comprehensive programme of political education so people understand how the system works and who does what. “Sadly, until everyone takes responsibility for the part they have to play in doing things differently then I worry that things won’t change. I hate being so negative, but since Jo’s murder I am struggling to see any improvement in our political discourse and culture.” A senior Conservative MP who has faced death threats said: “The police are doing their best but response times at the moment are at an all-time low. Many of my colleagues are scared. They shouldn’t have to rely on alarms. Police presence could at least help act as a deterrent. There’s been a lot of talk from past home secretaries but not a lot of action.” The veteran MP Margaret Hodge said what Freer had experienced was “terrible but not surprising”. She said: “The rise of social media has created an avalanche of threats. Anonymity on those platforms makes it vicious. My first death threat was in 1976 when a man came after me with an axe. When challenging the rise of the British National party (BNP), social media wasn’t present. So death threats came via emails, phone calls and letters. “Since the 7 October attacks [in Israel], I’ve had security presence in my constituency, I’ve had to change my behaviour and switch up my work routes. Only this morning after Mike’s announcement, someone said they plan to remove Margaret Hodge from the earth. If MPs are scared and want police presence at their constituency office, they should get it.” A UK parliament spokesperson said: “The ability for members and members’ staff to perform their parliamentary duties safely both on and off the estate is fundamental to our democracy. We work closely with the Met’s parliamentary liaison and investigations team and, through them, local police forces, with whom we share responsibility for the security of MPs and their staff away from the parliamentary estate.”"

        "content": "Voters in MP Mike Freer’s constituency have expressed their fears after he announced his decision to stand down after a “constant string” of death threats, abuse and intimidation. The justice minister and member for Finchley and Golders Green announced he would not seek re-election this year, with the “final straw” being a suspected arson attack on his constituency office in December. Freer said the onslaught of abuse had “weighed heavily” on him and his family. Voters in his constituency, which has a large Jewish population, spoke of their shock at his decision. Rabbi Miriam Berger at Finchley Reform synagogue said it “confirmed everything the community has been feeling since 7 October – that there’s been a significant rise in antisemitism”. She said: “For me, the news about Mike Freer really was incredibly significant because it’s affecting the democratic process and it’s saying to people: ‘You’re in danger being even an ally to the Jewish community.’ For me that takes it to another level in terms of the reality of what it is to be a British Jew at the moment.” Freer, an outspoken defender of Israel who has represented Finchley and Golders Green since 2010, said he and his staff started to wear stab vests at public events in his constituency after police advice. The MP told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The level of abuse I get standing up for my constituents on antisemitism and on Israel has to be a factor.” Lucy Weiner, who works at the cafe at the synagogue, said: “I felt actually quite sick to the pit of my stomach that here in London, in 2024, somebody feels they have to step back from a role they’ve been so prominent in, and so successful in, for so many years because of their point of view.”   Related: Harriet Harman urges party leaders to address MPs’ safety   Weiner’s 23-year-old daughter, Chessy Weiner, said: “Instead of threatening someone’s safety, just don’t vote for them. That’s how we exist in a democracy.” Weiner added: “A part of me is in disbelief that we’re actually living through times when this is happening again, and disbelief when you hear terrible things are happening and other people denying that they’re happening.” Berger has held her post at Finchley Reform synagogue, which is protected with gates and security guards, for 18 years. “In the beginning of my career, I felt maybe the need for security was a bit of a hangover from other periods in our history when security has been so necessary. “Now it doesn’t feel like it’s something that’s part of the past in any way, it’s very much about the present. Whenever there are people who are disagreeing with the Israeli government and their actions, it threatens the Jewish community all over the world.” Some voters, such as Kenneth Bearsley, 71, were not aware of Freer’s decision to stand down. When asked if more should be done to protect MPs, Bearsley said: “Absolutely. In this case, if he really believes that he’s under threat then he should be protected.” Joe Kletz, 28, said it feels “like we’re entering some kind of time that is unprecedented in modern UK history … I haven’t seen anything like this before and I don’t know how to respond to it to be frank. I mean, it is so extreme.” Rabbi Rebecca Birk, at Finchley Progressive synagogue in north Finchley, said she was really surprised at Freer’s decision. “I texted him this morning. It feels [like] a really dark day for politics if you can be bullied out of a role because of harassment.” Birk, 53, said she had not always agreed with the MP’s views – particularly on refugees and asylum seekers – but described him as a “great man”. The rabbi described her concerns about Islamophobia and antisemitism within the community and hopes for calm. “My concern is not to become too polarised and to just keep things civil and calm and peaceful and allow our kids to feel like they’re still safe within the wider community.”"

        "content": "John Harris rightly warns that by trying to demonstrate that Labour has ditched its Corbynite mantle and now wears the smart suit of economic prudence and financial restraint, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves risk achieving just one term in government (Thinking small may get Labour into No 10. It could also stop it staying there, 28 January). By voting for a Labour government, people will be trusting it to tackle their most pressing concerns, such as rising hospital waiting lists, crumbling schools, squalid housing, inability to access social care, and the struggle to cover the cost of even the basic requirements of daily living.  The electorate will expect perceptible improvements in these essential services within Labour’s first term in office. The trust that Starmer and Reeves seek is fragile and must be reciprocated. Therefore, in return, Starmer must trust the public and have the courage to be honest with them that in order to meet their expectations there needs to be a significant increase in the level of government spending and a fundamental reform of taxation so that those with the most contribute the most. Starmer knows this, the Labour party knows this, and the public know this. Failure to articulate this will inevitably lead to the trust that voters placed in Labour quickly evaporating. Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire • John Harris writes that Rachel Reeves is drifting into a “tight-fisted kind of supply-side economics” which means “that the key to solving the housing crisis is a mere relaxation of planning laws”. The housing crisis isn’t a problem of supply. It’s the domination of housebuilding by commodity production, itself dominated by an oligopoly (the big builders), the huge loss of council homes as a result of the right-to-buy policy, and the abandonment of council housebuilding as a priority. Changing planning rules will not push the oligopoly into building for social need. They build at a scale and pace which maximises their profit. The key to resolving this lies in making social rent council housing the first housing priority, supported by central government grants. The more than 100,000 households in temporary accommodation and 1.2 million on waiting lists are not about to get mortgages. As the experience of the Attlee government shows, when you do what is necessary, you can find the means of paying for it. Just imagine if “getting the debt down” had been applied in 1945. We wouldn’t have been able to afford to build 1m council homes, not to mention launching the NHS. The debt to GDP ratio then was 250% compared with 100% today. I wonder what Aneurin Bevan would have said to that.Martin WicksSecretary, Labour Campaign for Council Housing • I doubt if John Harris is right to critique the Keir Starmer project as a politics characterised by smallness. Surely what the public wants is a politics where everything is dialled down a notch or two, and Starmer’s steadiness might be excellent for this. A good Labour majority, achieved on a modest agenda, would tone things down. In actual power, Labour would have the advantage of slaying the bogeys of the right, better controlling the wider debate, and starting to diffuse the hysteria that creates paralysis. The electorate is fearful, not least because of world events. A progressive politics requires a less fearful, more reasoned atmosphere, in which people may eventually be able to venture more generous policies. Dr Stefan HawlinOxford • John Harris rightly mentions the “barrage of hostility” Labour will face in government from a “coalition of forces”, ranging from the Telegraph to GB News, but doesn’t say how the real “barrage” will start before the election, and will be just as virulent and malicious regardless of the policies in the manifesto. Labour’s “green investment plan”, for instance, will be exaggerated and misinterpreted by the rightwing media, and viewed as unaffordable, if it lasts till then, and Keir Starmer will be accused of lacking consistency and principle if he makes another U-turn and drops it. “Political smallness” is cowardly, but also mistaken as it inevitably leads to the Tories yet again dictating the narrative. We know that the richest 1% in the UK own 36.5% of all financial assets, with a value of £1.8tn, and that most of the CEOs of the top companies earn in excess of a hundred times the amount earned by their average employee. We know too, how economic theories such as Laffer’s curve and trickle-down economics have been debunked by modern economists, and how even during the majority of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, the top rate of income tax was 15% higher than today’s rate, and that it was deemed unfair by her long-serving chancellor, Nigel Lawson, for unearned income to be taxed at a lower rate than earned income.  Going on to the front foot and promising to tackle any of these injustices will be popular electorally, and better than meekly reacting to government decisions. Rather than waiting for Jeremy Hunt’s budget, which will inevitably spend the Treasury’s “£20bn windfall” on tax bribes, Labour should publish its own alternative finance bill, spending the money on any of Larry Elliott’s excellent suggestions, or on providing decent pay for junior doctors, nurses and teachers, and those working in the care sector. With the economic multipliers quickly kicking in, the latter would be far cheaper than Tories admit, and prevent the current exodus of key workers continuing.

This, in my view, and that of nearly all of my family and respected friends and colleagues, involves calling back from retirement the only public figure who comes out of the past quarter-century with any lasting credit: Rory Stewart. To succeed in this patriotic endeavour, we realise that we have somehow not only to re-recruit him, but to persuade the sensible members of the electorate to get rid of both the present Conservative and Labour parties and replace them with a younger membership more concerned with the wellbeing of the nation – their families and those of their friends – than their own temporary advantage. Perhaps our new monarch will reassume his prerogative and dismiss the prime minister supported by the present House of Commons with one of a different membership more representative of public opinion.Prof John A DavisGreat Shelford, Cambridgeshire • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

(See 2.51pm.)\n\n\nLabour will not raise corporation tax above its current rate of 25% during the next parliament, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has pledged, in an attempt to offer businesses greater certainty.\n\n\nForcing all UK supermarkets to put “not for EU” labels on meat, dairy and plant products in a move to assuage the concerns of unionists in Northern Ireland will force up prices and undermine the war against inflation, ministers have been told.\n\n\nMPs have passed unopposed two items of secondary legislation needed to implement the changes to the post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland negotiated by the DUP. No MP voted against either measure even though during the debates some Tory Brexiters expressed concerns about the plans, and the DUP MP Sammy Wilson said that he did not support the deal. They believe it does not do enough to disapply EU law in Northern Ireland. By contact, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said his party did not support the plan – but that is because because they feel it undermines the Good Friday agreement. (See 4.02pm.)\n\n\n\n\n 4.49pm GMT \nMany unionists still 'deeply worried' about post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland, former DUP deputy leader says\n\nMany unionists are still “deeply worried” about the impact of post-Brexit trading rules on Northern Ireland, despite the changes announced this week, a former deputy leader of the DUP said today.\nNigel Dodds, who sits in the House of Lords, told peers this afternoon:\n\nThere are still many unionists who are deeply worried and concerned that the Irish Sea border … still exists, since many goods coming from Great Britain, British goods coming to Northern Ireland, especially in manufacturing, still need to go through full EU compliance checks, procedures.\n\nDodds was speaking as Lord Caine, a Northern Ireland minister, made a statement about the Strengthening the Union command paper issued this week. Dodds asked him:\n\nWill he also confirm the concern that there is among many unionists – and he knows Northern Ireland very well – at the continued sovereignty, jurisdiction and application of EU laws over large swathes of our economy in 300 areas, to which the Stormont brake doesn’t apply and we cannot make or amend laws within those areas?\n\nCaine replied:\n\nI am sorry to say to him that the government does take a very different view as a result of the deal that has been agreed over the past few days, as indeed I should gently point out does his party leader, who along with the government now accepts that what we have agreed is a firm basis for going back into the institutions and re-establishing the executive and the assembly at Stormont.\nWe simply don’t recognise that what he describes is anything like a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. As a result of this deal the number of goods that will pass through into Northern Ireland without checks will be significantly increased.\n\n\n\n\n 4.26pm GMT \n\nWhile Labour was holding a major business conference today, Rishi Sunak was holding an event in Downing Street to launch Help to Grow, a scheme offering “one-stop shop” support and advice to small firms. Sunak said: “I come from a small business family, so I’ve got enormous respect for anyone who has taken that entrepreneurial plunge and has that entrepreneurial drive.”\n\nUpdated at 4.34pm GMT\n\n\n 4.02pm GMT \nHeaton-Harris rejects claims DUP deal has undermined Good Friday agreement as MPs back new laws\n\nMPs have now approved the second set of regulations needed to implement the reforms in the Safeguarding the Union report published yesterday. These were regulations relating to the UK’s internal markets.\nHere are some of the main points from the debates.\n\nColum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, claimed that the document published yesterday undermined the Good Friday agreement. The document says the government will “never be neutral” on the union. Eastwood suggested this contradicted a famous declaration in 1990 by Peter Brooke, the then Northern Ireland secretary, that helped to pave the way for the IRA ceasefire and the peace process talks. Eastwood asked Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary:\n\n\nPeter Brooke once said that Britain had no selfish or strategic interest in Northern Ireland, and that was later repeated in the Downing Street declaration. Reading the command paper it would seem to me that this government has moved from that position and I think undermines the Good Friday agreement. It seems that they … have moved away from the principle of rigorous impartiality.\nDoes the secretary of state agree with Peter Brooke’s assertion and the Downing Street declaration? Or is he moving to a different place?\n\nIn response, Heaton-Harris said he agreed with what Brooke said. And he said the government was committed to the Good Friday agreement, which says that Irish reunification can happen with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.\n\nHeaton-Harris confirmed the government wants to legislate to avoid regulatory divergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland on veterinary medicines. He said the government needed to find a solution because the grace period, where the post-Brexit rules don’t apply, is due to end.\n\n\nHilary Benn, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said Labour wanted to “negotiate an SPS [sanitary and phytosanitary] agreement with the EU, with the intention of removing checks on animals, food and plants, not only between GB and NI, but between the whole of the UK and the EU, which would of course benefit farmers, food businesses and the horticultural industry in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom”.\n\n\nEastwood complained that the process leading up to yesterday’s paper implied the government only cared about the DUP. “It has to be understood that there are more people in Northern Ireland than just the DUP and just unionism,” he said.\n\n\nAnd Eastwood said his party did not support the plan. He said:\n\n\nWe think it has moved far beyond the principles set out in the Good Friday agreement, it is undermining north-south cooperation, and it’s far too much focused on east-west.\nMoving on from this point, we need to ensure that any future negotiation is done with all parties and both governments so everybody can feel comfortable with the result.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.36pm GMT\n\n\n 3.33pm GMT \nBeing PM is like being national football coach, says Blair, as he reveals he's publishing how to guide to governing\n\nTony Blair has written a guide to political leadership “for the busy, aspiring leader”, to be published later this year, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe former prime minister uses examples from political systems around the world for a manual that he would have wanted in 1997 when New Labour swept to power, according to publisher Hutchinson Heinemann.\nThe book shares insights from his personal experience and from observing other world leaders at first hand, while he was in office and since leaving Downing Street.\nBlair said: “Governing a country is in one sense a little like being the national football coach of a football-crazy nation. Everyone has an opinion. Everyone thinks they can do it and do it better than you.\n“The role of leader is a privilege, of course, but a privilege that is painful. The most painful part? To get things done.\n“You arrive in power as the great persuader. You govern as the CEO. Persuasion is about talking. Governing is about doing.\n“The good news is that there is a wealth of experience and examples, good and bad, to follow or to learn from.\n“This book is not an academic work or designed to be comprehensive. It’s a short guide to governing for the busy, aspiring leader.”\nHutchinson Heinemann will publish the book in physical, ebook and audio editions in the UK in September.\n\n\n\n\n 3.23pm GMT \nPost-Brexit food labelling rules to appease DUP will lead to higher prices, says industry\n\nForcing all UK supermarkets to put “not for EU” labels on meat, dairy and plant products in a move to assuage the concerns of unionists in Northern Ireland will force up prices and increase inflation, ministers have been told. Daniel Boffey has the story here.\n\n Related: Post-Brexit food labelling rules to appease DUP will lead to higher prices, says industry \n\n\n\n\n 3.21pm GMT \n\nThis is from the Economist’s Matthew Holehouse on Keir Starmer’s pitch to business leaders.\n\n\nPretty clear from Labour’s business conference that Starmer has left zero room for a u-turn on planning reform. Pretty much central to the pitch.— Matthew Holehouse (@mattholehouse) February 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.55pm GMT \n\n\n\n\n 2.51pm GMT \nStarmer says Labour would 'level up workers' rights in way not attempted for decades'\n\nAnd here are the main lines from Keir Starmer’s speech to the Labour business conference.\n\nStarmer said Labour would “level up workers’ rights” in a way not seen for decades. And he insisted that this would be good for economic growth. He said:\n\n\nI want to be crystal clear about this, we are going to level up workers’ rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades.\nAnd that might not please everyone in the room or the wider business community.\nBut nobody can doubt that our labour market is at the heart of our challenges on productivity, a clear reason why the wealth we create fails to generate economic security.\nThat’s not just an argument about social justice, it’s also about growth.\nBecause the growth we need cannot come from driving down the terms and conditions of the British people, that is not a pathway to sustained productivity improvement.\nIn fact, if anything, it distorts our economy with perverse incentives on things like investment in technology.\nI accept this may be a challenge for some businesses.\n\nStarmer was referring to plans set out in Labour’s new deal for working people.\n\nHe said he believed business serves the national interest, not just the interests of shareholders. He said:\n\n\nI also know that the caricature that British business only serves the shareholder interest is lazy and out of date.\nIn fact, one of the things I draw great hope from is the determination I see, from the countless business leaders I’ve met, to serve the national interest.\nA pride, not just in the contribution you already make, but what else you could achieve if you had a government that matched your ambition.\nThat’s why, as we’ve drawn up our plans for Britain. We haven’t just opened our doors, we’ve taken decisions together as equal partners in the venture of national renewal. Your fingerprints – on every one of our five missions.\n\n\nHe said the turnout at the event showed how much the party had changed. He said:\n\n\nLet’s imagine that you were invited to an event like this, a Labour business conference, before any of the changes to our party had taken place.\nThe question is: would you go?\nWould you, as a wealth creator, feel that your ambition, the vital role you play in our economy, commanded the respect it deserves?\n\nAs Lizzy Buchan from the Mirror reports, someone shouted “no”.\n\n\nKeir Starmer asks an audience of business leaders if they would have come to a Labour business conference in 2019.“No,” shouts an audience member.Starmer jokes there is no audience participation - and tells people to “put your glitter away” pic.twitter.com/RT8e8UVR86— Lizzy Buchan (@LizzyBuchan) February 1, 2024\n\n\n\nHe said Labour had to be a party of business because “private enterprise is how we pay our way in the world”.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.07pm GMT\n\n\n 2.25pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer has just finished his speech to Labour’s business conference.

(See 12.37pm.)\nReferring to his predecessor, Yousaf told MSPs:\n\nWhen it comes to steering this country through some of its darkest days, I am very pleased we had Nicola Sturgeon in charge here of the Scottish government as opposed to Boris Johnson. On the big calls, many of the decisions we made helped to save lives.\n\nYousaf said he accepted that there may have been times when Scottish ministers “could have perhaps moved quicker, or moved earlier, or done thing differently”.\nBut he added:\n\nOur political opponents may well try to rewrite history and engage in smears and insults.\nI can stand up here and say I know that every single day of that pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon, the rest of us in the Scottish government, civil service included, worked for one reason and one reason only: to protect the people of Scotland from the harms of Covid.\n\nAnd here is Severin Carrell’s story about Alister Jack’s evidence to the Covid inquiry in Edinburgh today.\n\n Related: ‘I don’t buy it’: Scottish secretary dismisses Sturgeon’s Covid inquiry tears \n\n\nUpdated at 2.16pm GMT\n\n\n 1.57pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons MPs have just approved the new regulations relating to the Windsor framework, implementing proposals in the Safeguarding the Union document published yesterday.

Davey has now said sorry in an article published in the Guardian. (See 11.39am.) Asked why he did not do that earlier, Davey replied:\n\nI said very early on that I regretted it. I probably should have said much earlier, I accept that … I felt it and I don’t know why. I just probably should have said. I was saying regret and I felt that was getting over that point, but yeah, I probably should [have said] sorry earlier.\n\n\n\n\n 1.43pm GMT \n\nPenny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has criticised the Welsh government’s plan to increase the size of the Senedd (the Welsh parliament).\nAs PA Media reports, legislation tabled by the Labour-run Welsh government, as part of its cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru, seeks to increase the number of Senedd members from 60 to 96 while also making the way they are elected more proportional.\nSpeaking during business questions this morning, Mordaunt said she was “shocked” by the plans. She said an equivalent move for the UK parliament on the same constituent-to-politician ratio would result in an increase from 650 MPs to 2,058.\n\nUpdated at 2.14pm GMT\n\n\n 1.23pm GMT \nBusiness welcomes Labour's plan for 'roadmap for business taxation' and pledge to cap corporation tax\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce has welcomed the announcement from Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, in her speech today that Labour would set up a roadmap for business taxes.\nReeves told the business conference this morning:\n\nWithin its first six months, an incoming Labour government will publish a roadmap for business taxation, setting out our plans on business tax over the duration of the parliament.\n\nShevaun Haviland, the director general of the BCC, said:\n\nWe welcome today’s announcement from the shadow chancellor that she will publish a tax roadmap for business, if Labour wins power. It would help ensure simplicity, proportionality and certainty for future business planning. Any roadmap would also need to highlight how the tax burden for UK firms could be streamlined and be as fair as possible.\n\nHaviland said the BCC also welcomed the decision to cap corporation tax at 25%. She said:\n\nBusinesses will also welcome a cap of 25% corporation tax over the life of the next parliament. This commitment will give both UK firms and global companies looking to invest here the confidence to help the economy get back to sustainable growth.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.14pm GMT\n\n\n 1.07pm GMT \n\nTax Justice UK, which campaigns for a fairer and more effective tax system, has criticised Labour for ruling out an increase in corporation tax. (See 10.51am.) In a statement on Rachel Reeves’ announcement, Robert Palmer, its executive director, said: \n\nThe shadow chancellor is at risk of backing a future Labour government into a corner with the latest announcement ruling out a corporation tax rise. \nSimply put, schools are crumbling, hospitals and GP surgeries are creaking under the strain and councils are going bust. \nWhile plans to crack down on tax avoidance and windfall tax loopholes are welcome, alone, they aren’t enough. \nReeves needs to support sensible and credible ways of generating revenue, like keeping open fair tax rises on company profits, to sort out the mess that Britain is in.\n\n\n\n\n 12.59pm GMT \nThreats and attacks directed at MPs like Mike Freer 'an attack on democracy', says No 10\n\nDowning Street has described the threats and abuse directed at the Conservative minister Mike Freer, leading him to announce that he will quit parliament at the election, as “an attack on British democracy”.\nAsked to comment on Freer’s announcement, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the No 10 lobby briefing:\n\nThe prime minister is extremely saddened that Mr Freer has faced such vitriolic hatred that he feels he’s no longer able to serve his local community. \nThe prime minister believes that serving and representing your community is a unique privilege and making a difference to people’s lives is the most rewarding job you can do. No elected representative deserves to be abused or intimidated and the attacks and abuse that Mike Freer references are clearly deeply distressing. They’re not just an attack on him, but an attack on British democracy.\nThe prime minister feels that it is important that whilst people are free to debate issues passionately and have robust debate, intimidation [and] abuse is simply unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n 12.37pm GMT \nScotland secretary says he does not believe Sturgeon's claim she did not use Covid crisis to push case of independence\n\nAlister Jack, the Scotland secretary, has told the UK Covid inquiry that he did not believe Nicola Sturgeon when she said she did not try to use the Covid crisis to further her campaign for independence.\nIn evidence to the inquiry yesterday, the former SNP first minister became emotional as she strongly rejected claims that she sought to exploit the crisis for political gain. Sturgeon insisted:\n\nI will carry regret at the decisions and judgments I got wrong, but I will always know in my heart, and in my soul, that my instincts and my motivation was nothing other than trying to do the best in the face of this pandemic.\n\nBut, when asked about this, Jack told the inquiry today:\n\nI watched that evidence from yesterday and I didn’t believe it for a minute.\nI think Nicola Sturgeon could cry from one eye if she wanted to.\n\nHe also said it was “inevitable there would be tensions” between the Scottish and UK governments given their different political positions on the union. He explained:\n\nThe then first minister saw her job as leader of a nationalist government to break up the UK.\nDevolution works very well but works very well when both governments want to work together.\nBut when one government wants to destroy the UK and destroy devolution, then there are tensions.\nThose tensions existed before the pandemic, during the pandemic and they exist now today.\n\nJack also told the inquiry he had deleted all his WhatsApp messages in November 2021 because he wanted to free up data on his phone. He said he did not think he was doing anything wrong at the time, because he did not use WhatsApp to take government decisions.\nBut he said he accepted now that that was wrong. He told the inquiry:\n\nI think if I could turn the clock back, knowing what I know now, I would have sought a different solution for my lack of storage capacity.\nI’m a bit of a luddite – I’m the only member of the cabinet not to have any social media accounts.\nBut that’s no excuse – I regret that I deleted my entire account.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.52pm GMT\n\n\n 12.15pm GMT \nLeftwing groups say Labour should prioritise public services instead of capping corporation tax at lowest level in G7\n\nTwo leftwing groups have criticised Labour for promising not to put up corporation tax.\nMomentum, the organisation originally set up to promote Jeremy Corbyn’s views when he was party leader, has posted messages on X saying this is “bad policy and bad politics”.\n\n\nThe UK has the lowest level of corporation tax in the G7.Meanwhile, our public services are battered & starved of funds.Starmer and Reeves' cosying up to big business is bad policy and bad politics. https://t.co/C5Wq69lpst— Momentum 🌹 (@PeoplesMomentum) February 1, 2024\n\n\n\nThe UK has the lowest level of corporation tax in the G7.Meanwhile, our public services are battered & starved of funds.Starmer and Reeves’ cosying up to big business is bad policy and bad politics.\n\n\nThe Labour Leadership’s priorities are deeply out of touch with the labour movement *and* the public.\nVoters want higher wages, more money in public services and free school meals... \n... not bungs for bankers & gifts to the City. \nWe need real Labour values\n\nMomentum also points out that this is a clear breach of one of the “10 pledges” that Keir Starmer made when he was standing for Labour leader in 2020. Those pledges included one saying he would reverse the Tories’ cuts in corporation tax. That implied he would raise it to 28%, the level it was when the Consevatives took office in 2010.\nMomentum regularly criticises the Labour leadership, but the announcement has also been denounced today by Compass, the leftwing thinktank and campaign group committed to pluralist politics. Neal Lawson, its director, said:\n\nThe UK’s corporation tax rate is already the lowest in the G7. Labour’s pledge today not to raise it in government only serves to underline how difficult it is to change things under our political system.\nMore and more people and organisations want a society that is fairer and more equal and better investment in our crumbling public services. But to win under FPTP [first past the post] means promising to the corporate lobby that nothing much will change, and so dissatisfaction with politics grows.\n\n\n\n\n 11.39am GMT \nLib Dem leader Ed Davey says he is sorry he did not realise Post Office was lying to him about Horizon scandal\n\nEd Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has said that he is sorry that, as Post Office minister for two years in the coalition government, he did not realise Post Office managers were lying to him about the Horizon scandal. He says:\n\nThe Post Office Horizon scandal is the greatest miscarriage of justice of our time, and I am deeply sorry for the families who have had their lives ruined by it. As one of the ministers over the 20 years of this scandal, including my time as minister responsible for postal affairs, I’m sorry I did not see through the Post Office’s lies – and that it took me five months to meet Alan Bates, the man who has done so much to uncover it.\n\nDavey made the comment in an article for the Guardian.\n\n Related: I fell for Post Office lies – and I’m sorry. But I won’t be silent as Tories prey on victims’ trauma | Ed Davey \n\nHis wording is intended to repair the damage caused by a much-criticised interview last month in which Davey repeatedly refused to say he was sorry about what happened.\nDavey is only one of many Post Office ministers, from all three main UK parties, who arguably might have done more to help victims of the Horizon scandal. But, largely because he is a party leader, he has faced more public criticism for his role in this than the others.\n\nUpdated at 11.43am GMT\n\n\n 11.26am GMT \nNobody in EU raising 'red flags' about Windsor framework changes, Irish PM Leo Varadkar says\n\nThe European Commission has said that it will “carefully analyse” the UK government’s proposals announced yesterday to change the way the Windsor framework (setting out post-Brexit trading rules) works in Northern Ireland. But at an EU meeting today, Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM), said he did not think Brussels would have major concerns about it. He said:\n\nThere are definitely going to be some questions about what was agreed between the UK and DUP but nobody is at this stage saying that there’s any red flags or anything that gives us major concern.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.39am GMT\n\n\n 11.13am GMT \nMike Freer on quitting as MP: I narrowly avoided David Amess killer\n\nMike Freer, the justice minister, has described how he escaped David Amess’s killer by a “stroke of luck” after announcing he will not seek re-election over fears for his safety.

Basically the Tories have already don the work on this tax.— Torsten Bell (@TorstenBell) February 1, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.40am GMT\n\n\n 10.51am GMT \nWhat Reeves said about pledge not to increase corporation tax\n\nThis is what Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said in her speech about Labour’s pledge not to increase corporation tax.\n\nThere have been 26 changes to our corporation tax arrangements in this parliament alone. We can’t go on like this.\nWe reject the calls from those on the right wing of the Conservative party to cut corporation tax. Our current rate is the lowest in the G7.\nWe believe that 25 per cent rate strikes the correct balance between the needs of our public finances, and the demands of a competitive global economy.\nThe next Labour government will make the pro-business choice and the pro-growth choice: we will cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of 25% for the next parliament. And should our competitiveness come under threat, if necessary we will act.\nThat means businesses can plan investment projects today, with the confidence of knowing how their returns will be taxed for the rest of this decade.\nTo those of you in this room who might be wondering – do we really mean what we say? Has Labour really changed? Will warm words today be matched by action in government?\nBe in no doubt. We will campaign as a pro-business party – and we will govern as a pro-business party.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.41am GMT\n\n\n 10.47am GMT \n\nReeves has finished taking questions from journalists, and she is now doing a Q&A with a moderator, addressing issues raised by business figures in the audience.\n\nUpdated at 11.42am GMT\n\n\n 10.43am GMT \n\nQ: What do you expect business to do in return as part of a contract with a Labour government? How will they have to change?\nReeves says the new deal for working people sets out protections for workers that businesses would have to accept. And Labour would enforce the global minimum rate of corporation tax.\nShe says it is not just Labour saying what it would do. She says Labour’s ideas would be “shaped by business”. \n\n\n\n 10.41am GMT \n\nQ: Alan Bates, the former post officer operator, has said today the compensation he was offered was derisory. If you are chancellor, you would have to authorise compensation. Do they deserve more?\nReeves says this is a scandal, and she says the post office operators must be properly compensated. She says the government should set aside money for this in the budget.\n\n\n\n 10.39am GMT \n\nReeves says, when she announced the £28bn green investment fund in 2021, she did not envisage the Liz Truss mini-budget.\n\n\n\n 10.38am GMT \n\nQ: In 2021 you said you would review loopholes in the tax system? Have you not found any? Or are you holding those in reserve until after the election?\nReeves says she has announced plans to close three – on non-doms, on private school fees, and one affecting private equity.\n\n\n\n 10.37am GMT \n\nQ: Will you do anything to take people like nurses and teachers out of the higher rate of tax?\nReeves says she has said taxes on working people are too high. But she will not make commitments that are not funded, she says.\n\n\n\n 10.35am GMT \n\nQ: Do you appreciate why people think your change of stance on bankers’ bonuses means people say they do not know what you stand for?\nReeves says her number one priority is offering economic stability. That will always come first under Labour, she says.\n\nUpdated at 10.36am GMT\n\n\n 10.34am GMT \n\nQ: Is the pledge to spend £28bn a year on green jobs a liability, and will you drop it?\nReeves says the UK needs green investment. But the green prosperity plan would have to be consistent with Labour’s fiscal rules.\nThere is at least one more budget before the election, possibly two, she says.\nShe implies final announcements won’t be made until then.\n\n\n\n 10.33am GMT \nReeves defends decision to rule out reimposing cap on bankers' bonuses\n\nReeves is now taking questions from journalists.\nQ: Two days ago you said you would not bring back the cap on bankers’ bonuses. But three months ago you criticised the government for doing that. How can people trust you if you keep changing your mind?\nReeves says she did not think lifting the cap was right.\nBut she says business wants certainty.\nShe says safeguards against excessive risk-taking are now stronger than they were. And bonuses can be clawed back. That is why she won’t bring the cap back.\nUPDATE: Reeves said:\n\nWhat I hear loud and clear from business is that what it will take to get them to invest in Britain is stability and the last thing they need is more chopping and changing.\nThe truth is, that in financial services there are a lot more rules and regulations and safeguards in place than there were before the financial crisis, for example banks have to put aside much more capital than they did before 2008.\nAnd there are much stronger rules about clawing back bankers’ bonuses. So we didn’t think it was the right priority, it wouldn’t have been my number one priority in that budget.\nBut the chopping and changing has got to end if we’re going to give stability to business and that’s why we will not be bringing that back.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.02pm GMT\n\n\n 10.28am GMT \nReeves says corporation tax will not rise above its current 25% rate during next parliament if Labour wins\n\nReeves says in Davos she met leading figures who wanted to be sure they could confidently invest in the UK.\nAfter 14 years of uncertainty, “investment has cratered”, she says.\nThey want certainty – including on tax, she says.\nTax rates should not go up and down like a yo-yo.\nLabour will offer businesses a fair contract, she says.\nIt will be based on the assumption that they pay what is owed.\nBut alongside that will be a commitment from the government to ensure stability.\nReeves says business said “loud and clear” it wanted certainty.\nLabour will maintain full expensing (the £10bn a year tax cut announced by Jeremy Hunt in the autumn statement), she says.\nBut it will go further.\nShe says a 25% corporation tax rate strikes the right balance.\nThe next Labour government will cap the headline rate of corporation tax at 25% for the duration of the next parliament.\nAnd, if competitiveness comes under threat, Labour “will act”, she says.\n(That means she is not ruling out cutting it.)\nReeves says, if people doubt what she says, they should be in no doubt:\n\nWe will campaign as a pro-business party, and we will govern as a pro-business party.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.39am GMT\n\n\n 10.21am GMT \n\nReeves says she will “never play fast and loose with the public finances”.\nThat is why she will “never waver from iron-clad fiscal rules”.\n\n\n\n 10.19am GMT \n\nThe UK needs a government guided by clear purpose, Reeves says.\nLabour has set out five missions. But they are all tied to the economic mission – to raise growth.\nBut achieving growth cannot be done using policies from the 1980s and 1990s, she says.\nA new economic consensus is taking place. Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary, calls it new supply side economics. But Reeves says she prefers to call it securonomics.\n(She explained this in detail in a speech last year.)\n\nUpdated at 10.31am GMT\n\n\n 10.15am GMT \n\nReeves says these are challenging economic times, and the problems have been exacerbated by political instability.\nShe claims that almost every month there are reports of businesses choosing not to invest in the UK.\n\nThese are the symptoms of economic decline.\n\n\n\n\n 10.12am GMT \n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now.\nShe says this conference embodies the spirit of partnership with business to which the next Labour government is committed.\n\n\n\n 10.09am GMT \n\nErin Platts, the chief executive of HSBC Innovation Banking, which is sponsoring today’s Labour conference, is speaking now.\nShe says the UK is a global leader in innovation, but does not celebrate that enough.\n\nUpdated at 10.31am GMT\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \n\nRayner says if Labour wins the election, one thing is certain: it will face serious econonomic challenges from day one.\nShe says tackling these would require a two-way dialogue with business.\n\nUpdated at 10.31am GMT\n\n\n 10.04am GMT \nThere will be 'no surprises' for business under Labour, Rayner tells executives\n\nRayner says business will “always have a seat at the table” under a Labour government.\nShe says she and colleagues have already had a “frank conversation” with business figures about how they can boost the economy.\nShe says there will be “no surprises” for business under Labour.\nAnd she claims that she feels “a lot more comfortable in the company of business leaders” than she does at parliament, which she says is not welcoming to someone from a working class background.\n\nUpdated at 10.32am GMT\n\n\n 10.01am GMT \n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is about to give her speech to the Labour business conference. There is a live feed on Labour’s YouTube channel.\nAngela Rayner, the deputy leader, is introducing Reeves now.\n \n\n\n\n\n 9.56am GMT \nHunt plays down IMF warning about budget, saying if they were just advising against untargeted tax cuts, he agrees\n\nJeremy Hunt was also asked about recent implict criticism he has received from the IMF in his interview with Nick Robinson. Rather than just say that they were wrong (as he did when asked about the OBR – see 9.30am), Hunt suggested the IMF was just warning against “untargeted” tax cuts.\nHe said:\n\nUntargeted tax cuts that are just crowd pleasers. I agree with the IMF. But if they are strategic, small tax cuts, then that is a very important part of the strategy to grow the economy …\nWhat the IMF were really saying, I think, when they use that word “discretionary”, is [that] a tax cut that isn’t going to help grow the economy over the long run wouldn’t be the right thing to do. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. That’s what I think they were saying, that’s what I hope they were saying, and if they were, I would agree with them.\n\nNo doubt the IMF does think that targeted tax cuts are better than untargeted ones.\nBut this week, when it issued its warning to the UK, the IMF was making a different point, about the balance between tax cuts and public spending. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, said:\n\nThere is a need to put in place medium-term fiscal plans that will accommodate a very significant increase in spending pressures.\nIn the case of the UK, you might think of spending on healthcare and modernising the NHS; spending on social care; on education; you might think about critical public investment to address the climate transition; but also to boost growth.\n\nGourinchas said that, in the light of these commitments, the UK would have to balance tax and spending needs to ensure debt did not get out of control. He went on:\n\nIn that context we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts as envisioned and discussed now.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.35am GMT\n\n\n 9.30am GMT \nHunt criticises OBR boss Richard Hughes for calling his long-term budget spending forecasts 'work of fiction'\n\nIn his interview with the BBC’s Nick Robinson, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, criticised Richard Hughes, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, for calling the Treasury’s long-term public spending forecasts worse than “a work of fiction”.\nHughes told a Lords committee last month:\n\nSome people call [the projections] a work of fiction, but that is probably being generous when someone has bothered to write a work of fiction and the government hasn’t even bothered to write down what its departmental spending plans are underpinning the plans for public services.\n\nAsked about the comment, Hunt said:\n\nThose words are wrong and they should not have been said.\nThe government decides spending plans and spending reviews.\nThe next spending review will start in April 2025 and obviously until that point when that spending review is done, we do not publish our spending plans. No government ever has.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.36am GMT\n\n\n 9.09am GMT \nJeremy Hunt suggests tax cuts in budget won’t match last year’s £20bn giveaway\n\nGood morning. Labour is holding a business conference today, with tickets going at £1,000 a time to executives who want to learn how a Keir Starmer government might handle the economy. According to a press release overnight, 400 senior business leaders are attending, and tickets sold out within four hours. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, are both speaking.\nBut this morning it is Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, making the news, with a declaration that his scope for tax cuts in the budget may be limited. In an interview with the BBC’s Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Hunt said:\n\nIt does not look to me like we will have the same scope for cutting taxes in the spring budget that we had in the autumn statement.\nAnd so I need to set people’s expectations about the scale of what I am doing because people need to know that when a Conservative government cuts taxes we will do so in a responsible and sensible way.\nBut we also want to be clear that the direction of travel we want to go in is to lighten the tax burden.\n\nEarlier this week the Times reported that Hunt delivered this message to cabinet. In their report, Mehreen Khan and Steven Swinford said Hunt told colleagues there would be less headroom for tax cuts than in the autumn statement and that relatively low levels of ­productivity in Britain were “our major structural ­weakness”. Asked about the report on ITV’s Peston show last night, Hunt said:\n\nAs things stand at the moment, things can change, it doesn’t look like I’ll have the kind of room I had for those very big tax cuts in the autumn, and I did mention that to the cabinet, yes.\n\nThis may, of course, just be expectation management. In September last year Hunt said that tax cuts would be “virtually impossible” in the light of economic circumstances as they were then. Two months later, in the autumn statement, he announced tax cuts worth £20bn.\nBut, in assessing what politicians say, it is always worth starting with the assumption that they might be telling the truth, and it would not be surprising if Hunt has concluded that he cannot afford massive tax cuts – because that is exactly what mainstream economists are saying. Only this week the IMF suggested Hunt would not be able to reduce taxes without public spending being cut to an unacceptable level.\nIt is also worth pointing out that there is a huge difference between ruling out “very big tax cuts”, and ruling out any tax cuts. There were two main tax cuts in the autumn statement: a cut of 2p in the pound from national insurance, costing £9bn in 2024-25; and full expensing, a tax cut for business worth £11bn a year by 2027-28.\nFor electoral reasons, Hunt is expected to focus on personal tax cuts in the budget and he could still do quite a lot on that front without matching the £20bn splurge from last autumn.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10am: Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech and holds a Q&A at Labour’s business conference.\n10am: Rishi Sunak holds a meeting in Downing Street to mark the creation of a new small business council.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\nAfter 11.30am: MPs hold two 90-minute debates on the two regulations being passed to implement the reforms to the Northern Ireland Windsor framework announced yesterday.\n12pm: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions at Holyrood.\n2pm: Keir Starmer gives a speech and holds a Q&A at Labour’s business conference.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

        "content": "The Scotland secretary has dismissed Nicola Sturgeon’s raw emotions during her evidence to the Covid inquiry as insincere and false.\n“I thought she could cry from one eye if she wanted to,” Alister Jack told the inquiry on Thursday, as he acknowledged there were deep levels of distrust between him and senior Scottish government ministers.\nSturgeon’s eyes filled with tears and her voice broke a number of times during her daylong testimony to the inquiry in Edinburgh on Wednesday, as she recounted how “incredibly stressful” she found it dealing with the “horrendous” effects of the pandemic.\n\n Related: Nicola Sturgeon at the Covid inquiry: by turns defensive, lawyerly and very raw \n\nJack said his long experience of dealing with the then first minister made him extremely sceptical about the authenticity of her emotions. “I didn’t believe it for a minute,” he told Jamie Dawson KC, the inquiry’s Scottish counsel.\nHe said tensions between the two administrations came into sharp relief on 12 March 2020. Sturgeon, to the alarm of UK cabinet ministers, had announced a ban in Scotland of mass gatherings of more than 500 people that day, hours before the UK’s other governments had verified the plan.\nJack alleged the Scottish government then kept secret its knowledge of a significant Covid outbreak linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in February, where 36 people were infected.\nHe and Matt Hancock had met Jeane Freeman, who at the time was Scotland’s health secretary, on the evening of 12 March but Freeman did not mention the Nike outbreak; Hancock first learned of it when news of it leaked later that summer.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Gove, then a senior UK cabinet minister, told the inquiry on Monday that Sturgeon had “jumped the gun” by disclosing the ban first. Jack said her announcement also “breached confidentiality” because she revealed it was about to be discussed by Cobra, the UK government’s emergency committee.\nJack was challenged by Dawson on whether the UK government was also secretive about its thinking and policy decisions, including plans by Rishi Sunak, the then chancellor, for the “eat out to help out” financial plan for restaurants. Jack confirmed he did not brief Sturgeon’s officials about the proposal.\nAs an MP for a Scottish seat close to the English border, he said policy differences during Covid, on travel restrictions and local lockdowns, were “quite frustrating”. He accepted devolution existed but would rather all parts of the UK were aligned.\n“I thought the whole border thing was trying to appear that Scotland was a different country, a world apart,” he said.\nDawson said the antipathy seemed personal. John Swinney, then Sturgeon’s deputy first minister, told the inquiry he could not tolerate Jack because of his behaviour before the pandemic. By contrast, Swinney said he got on very well with Jack’s predecessor, David Mundell.\nJack agreed he had a poor relationship with Scottish ministers: he had taken four legal challenges against them over Scottish government policies. “Those tensions existed before the pandemic, during the pandemic and exist now today,” he said.\nDawson pressed the Scottish secretary over why he deleted all his WhatsApp messages – a recurrent theme during the inquiry. Jack said he had to wipe his messages because in the first half of the pandemic he had a basic mobile with only 16GB of memory.\nHe was advised to wipe all his WhatsApps, from his wife, his family, friends and colleagues, to allow the phone to work properly. He said he did not do government business by WhatsApp. “At the time, I didn’t think anything of it,” he said.\nPressed on that later by Claire Mitchell KC, counsel for the Scottish Covid Bereaved group, Jack apologised. He said had he known then what he now knows about their significance, he would have solved his phone capacity problem another way. “I regret that I deleted my entire account,” he said.\nIn closing submissions to the inquiry, which sat in Edinburgh for three weeks, Danny Friedman KC, representing two Scottish disabilities charities, said the Scottish government badly failed disabled people during the pandemic.\nIt set up policy sub groups based on ethnicity and for children, but not people with disabilities. “The notion that no one should be left behind was effectively thwarted before the crisis started,” said Friedman."

        "content": "Forcing all UK supermarkets to put “not for EU” labels on meat, dairy and plant products in a move to assuage the concerns of unionists in Northern Ireland will force up prices and undermine the war against inflation, ministers have been told. After months of uncertainty about the post-Brexit regulations, the government has said it will legislate so that the labelling requirement is universal from October as part of a “safeguarding the union” deal with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). The government is trying to convince the DUP, Northern Ireland’s biggest unionist party, to return to the Stormont power-sharing executive after a bitter two-year standoff over the trade border in the Irish Sea created by Brexit. As part of the new deal, ministers have said they will go further than is required under the so-called Windsor framework agreement with the EU that is designed to ensure meat, diary and plant products do not enter the single market via Northern Ireland.   Related: Northern Ireland to get new Brexit trade rules in deal to restore power sharing   Rather than just products coming into Northern Ireland from Britain requiring “not for EU” labels, all agri-foods sold in the UK will need to be labelled “to ensure no incentive arises for businesses to avoid placing goods on the Northern Ireland market”. Unionists have raised concerns that restricting the labelling requirements to goods transported into Northern Ireland from Great Britain would lead to a dwindling in the range of products going across the Irish Sea. Waitrose is among the supermarket brands that do not have stores in Northern Ireland but which will be affected by the draft legislation. It has claimed that redesigning the packaging will “add unnecessary costs when we are doing everything we can to keep costs down”. Karen Betts, the chief executive at the Food and Drink Federation, said it had been in “quite insubstantial” discussions with government for months about what was a “very complicated and expensive way” of ensuring the full array of British products are sold in Northern Ireland. She claimed the requirement would cost the industry about £250m a year and that the legislation would inevitably lead to a rise in prices for consumers. “We think the transition to the new label is going to cost about £150m and then somewhere between £200m and £250m costs a year. None of our companies operate on wide margins. So if you introduce a significant cost, in the end, at least a proportion of that will have to be passed on to the consumer.” Betts said many companies would not be able to meet the timetable set out for labelling to be changed. The government is expected to open a consultation on the issue on Friday. She said: “I think the real pity of it all is that companies are not going to put that money into innovation or investment into upskilling their employees or into pay. “It’s kind of a sunk cost. It’s a labelling change to solve a problem that we don’t think exists. We would like proper monitoring in place to understand whether it exists before you get into the place of imposing such a burden and such costs on businesses. In the end, some of that will be passed on to consumers. That will be unavoidable.” The post-Brexit deal struck by Boris Johnson with the EU in effect drew a border down the Irish Sea. The then prime minister later claimed that the EU was acting in bad faith when it demanded implementation of the appropriate checks on goods crossing from Britain to Northern Ireland. A solution was found under the Windsor framework, under which there is a green lane, renamed the UK “internal market lane”, for goods that are not destined to leave Northern Ireland. The latest deal is designed as a further sweetener."

        "published_date": "2024-02-01T15:00:22+00:00",
        "content": "The film Pride that tells the true story of a group of gay activists travelling from London to a valley in west Wales to support striking miners in the mid 1980s has a particular resonance for Jeremy Miles, one of the two men vying to become the next Welsh first minister. Miles grew up in the area, wondering about his place in the world as a gay young person as the strike raged around him. Four decades on, he represents the valley in the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, and goes into the leadership campaign with the backing of the National Union of Mineworkers. Speaking to the Guardian as he presented his leadership manifesto on Thursday, Miles says the sense of injustice he felt at Margaret Thatcher’s attack on the miners – plus the response of the community and unions – led to his political awakening. “I’m not asking for people to vote for me because I come from a working-class family or because I’m gay,” he says. “I’m describing my life story and my journey because I think it shows why I have the values I do. “I grew up in industrial south Wales in the 80s, seeing the industrial strife around us, the attack by the Tories on mining communities. I went to a Welsh medium comprehensive with a big catchment area – kids from the tip of the Gower peninsula to the top of the Swansea valley and you could see the families who were struggling. “I have a strong sense that the purpose of the Labour party is to support that working-class aspiration that I was brought up with. It isn’t about personal advancement but the collective.” Miles says his sexuality made him feel “on the outside”. He says: “That isn’t something people should feel. The heart of my politics is that people should feel they belong.” Another vital part of Miles’s pitch is the Welsh language. He was raised in a Welsh-speaking community and says as education and Welsh language minister, inclusivity is at the heart of what he is trying to achieve. “An inclusive vision for the language is part of our politics on the left in Wales. We talk about using a little bit every day and it belongs to you as much as it belongs to me. There’s something inclusive and warm about that. We can learn how to relate to other policy areas by thinking through that lens.” The outgoing first minister, Mark Drakeford, has urged his successor to be as radical as possible. “I think he’s right. We need political courage to grapple with some of the big challenges we have ahead and new ways of looking at things.” One of Drakeford’s most bold policies has been the widespread introduction of 20mph limits in Wales. Miles says: “The policy is the right policy. It will absolutely lead to safer roads and alleviate pressure on the NHS.” But he has called for a review of it to be moved forward. “People haven’t felt heard. We have to respond to that.” Commentators and Labour insiders see the race between Miles and his lone rival for the top job, Vaughan Gething, as neck and neck. As the health minister during the Covid crisis, Gething has the higher profile. But decisions made during the pandemic by the Welsh government were not universally popular and he will face a grilling when he is questioned at the Covid inquiry’s hearings in Cardiff later this month. The leadership race was hit by a minor storm when it emerged that Miles was not eligible for the support of Unite because he has not been a lay union official. Gething received the backing, which is being seen as a “stitch-up” by Miles’s supporters. Miles came to elected politics comparatively late but he sees that as a strength. He studied law at Oxford and held senior legal and commercial posts in the media sector before being elected in 2016. Two years later he was Brexit minister, strongly leading criticism of “full-on frontal attacks” on Welsh devolution from the UK government. He has attracted the ire of the Tories during his leadership campaign over his pro-EU stance and remains unabashed. “I support the closest possible relationship with the European Union,” he says. “My personal view is that rejoining the single market would be a positive thing for Wales and the UK.” Miles says many people have lost hope that things could be better. Asked if Welsh Labour, which has governed since devolution was not at least partly to blame, he says: “We’re not an independent country. We’re not divorced from the choices that 14 years of Tory governments have made in London. Our economy has suffered, our public services have suffered, the life chances of our young people have suffered.” He says it is critical that Labour wins the UK general election. “If I’m elected leader, that will be my urgent priority: to play our party in delivering that government. It will be a step-change in the life of people in Wales to have two Labour governments in Cardiff and London.” Miles mentions inclusivity and cooperation a lot. He has pledged to have at least as many women ministers as men. And he will work with other parties in the Senedd, which is a much more collaborative place than the House of Commons. If he loses, he would still work with Gething. “We get on fine. If he was to ask me, I’d be very glad to serve in his government.”"

        "content": "A minister has described how he escaped David Amess’s killer by a “stroke of luck” after announcing he will not seek re-election over fears for his safety. Mike Freer, the justice minister and Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said “a constant string of incidents” including death threats, abuse and narrow escapes had led him to decide to stand down at the next election. In the latest incident, Freer’s constituency office was the target of a suspected arson attack over Christmas. Two people have been charged. Freer, who represents an area with a large Jewish population, has been an outspoken defender of Israel. Tributes to Freer have poured in since he announced his decision to stand down in an interview with the Daily Mail on Wednesday night. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Freer described how he narrowly avoided an encounter with Ali Harbi Ali a month before he murdered the Southend West MP Sir David Amess. “He’d been to Finchley several times. He told [the police] that he’d come to Finchley on 21 September 2021 – I remember the date vividly – armed with the intention to harm. “And purely by a stroke of luck, the night before, Boris Johnson had moved me from the whips’ office to courts and equalities. Otherwise I would have been in Finchley and probably attacked.” Asked what the police had advised him to do while going about his duties as an MP, Freer said: “You just have to be aware of your surroundings. So when you park your car, just make sure there’s no one hanging around. When you approach the office, people quite legitimately could be waiting to see you. Always make sure you keep a distance. Always make sure the office is well lit, the CCTV is working, the panic buttons are there. “If you do a public event, always make sure you have an exit that you can run to behind you, in case someone comes at you from in front. It’s all that kind of awareness that becomes engrained.” He also decided to buy a stab vest. Asked whether he was being targeted because he represented a constituency with a large Jewish population, Freer said: “I can’t draw any other conclusion … The level of abuse I get standing up for my constituents on antisemitism and on Israel has to be a factor.” The Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain he was “really saddened” that Freer had decided not to seek re-election. “We all get death threats but Mike really has been targeted,” Hoyle said, revealing that he had received one himself last Friday. “The fact that MPs have these threats is totally unacceptable.” Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told GB News that Freer’s decision was “incredibly sad”. “Mike Freer is a brilliant minister and a great man and he made a huge contribution to British life,” she said. “We need to change the way that politics is conducted in this country so that people can air opinions without fear of harassment and intimidation.” Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said on X that Freer was a “champion for our community. This should not be the consequences of public service.” Freer told the Today programme: “When you get a constant string of incidents, some of which threaten your life, there comes a point where you say enough is enough. “MPs – we kind of sign up for it, we take it on the chin, particularly the lower-level stuff. But it’s not fair on our families and when our families feel the pressure, we really do have to evaluate whether we should continue.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-01T10:00:47+00:00",
        "content": "Last March, James Cleverly returned to the town in Sierra Leone where his late mother, Evelyn, was born. Having visited the country as a child, he was coming back as foreign secretary to launch his gender equality strategy in a place that clearly meant something to him. “I think of her all the time in the work we do,” he said. Nine months later, Cleverly returned to Africa for very different reasons. Now home secretary, he was promoting plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, plans he is said to have described privately as “batshit”. A few weeks after that, the man who once professed himself “absolutely” a feminist would find himself apologising for joking at a Downing Street party that “a little bit of [the “date rape” drug] Rohypnol in her drink every night” was “not really illegal if it’s only a little bit”. Britain’s current home secretary can be difficult to pigeonhole. He is the product of private schooling, the army reserve (in which he has served for decades) and Brexit-era politics, but also of childhood hardship and a mission to make his party more inclusive in which he still passionately believes. This is why – despite the enthusiasm in some quarters for Kemi Badenoch – his name is increasingly mentioned by moderate Tories seeking someone to back in the next leadership contest. Civil servants rate his willingness to listen; at the Home Office, he is rebuilding fences trampled by his sacked predecessor, Suella Braverman. “He’s never going to be an angry politician. He’s got the brief he’s got, but that, I think, is the big change,” says Sunder Katwala, the director of the identity and immigration thinktank British Future. Rugby-loving, sociable and relaxed – sometimes to a fault (he once said: “I talk too much and sometimes I speak a bit too frankly, which I think people like until they don’t like it”) – Cleverly is unusually well liked at Westminster. “He’s not out for his own ends and his rise wasn’t due to any unfair clambering over the top of other people. He was there at the right time in the right place, being a safe pair of hands,” says a former colleague, who attributes Cleverly’s survival under four Tory prime ministers to his old-fashioned approach of reliably executing the brief. He has made remarkably few enemies and caused no great disasters.   Cleverly is the kind of Tory whose experience of childhood hardship seems to harden their belief in austerity   But there have been no great triumphs, either. Although he is thoughtful on some complex topics, from terrorism to Black Lives Matter, he has yet to reveal a wider political vision or the strategic ruthlessness to defeat highly organised rivals. One ex-minister who praises him as “moderate and sensible” says: “Whether he would be eaten alive in a leadership contest by people who would be seen as more aggressive and challenging, I can’t say.” Another describes him as “everyone’s second preference” – the candidate no one hates, but who has yet to cultivate a following of ardent true believers. *** Cleverly was born in 1969 in Lewisham hospital, where his mother was a midwife. She had immigrated to Britain to work for the NHS in 1960, following her sister. The women then met and married brothers from Wiltshire. Cleverly grew up in south London in the 1970s and has recalled National Front marches in nearby streets, as well as kids teasing him for being mixed race. (When the Duchess of Sussex gave birth in 2019, he tweeted that the welcome afforded a mixed-race royal baby made him feel “a bit emotional”.) Whereas Braverman provoked and polarised with her attacks on multiculturalism, Cleverly’s instincts are to unify. “If we turn on ourselves, seek scapegoats, go into hiding or lash out it will only amplify what is already a sad and terrible thing,” he wrote on his blog in 2013, when the soldier Lee Rigby was murdered by terrorists not far from Cleverly’s family home. “But if we refuse to cast blame on an entire religion, make a point of standing shoulder to shoulder with our neighbours and continue to wear our military uniforms with pride, we shall have denied these thugs what they crave.” Yet Cleverly is also the kind of Tory that most confounds the left: one whose own experience of childhood hardship seems to harden their belief in fiscal austerity. He once defended the two-child benefit cap on the grounds that his parents couldn’t afford two sets of private education and so decided he would be an only child; even then, the family shared a one-bed flat to afford the school fees (for Riverston first, then Colfe’s, both in south London). “To my mother, education is taken incredibly seriously,” he has said. “They lived on a fold-out bed in the living room [to do it] … So when the left [talk about hardship], I’m sitting there very quietly, saying to myself: ‘Fuck off – you have no idea what you’re talking about.’’’ The young Cleverly was heavily into Dungeons & Dragons and also inherited his grandfather’s artistic streak. But he decided against going to art school after his father, a surveyor, told him he would never make any money. He chose instead to join the army and thereafter put minimal effort into his A-levels. When a bad injury at Sandhurst ended his army career, he was left with two poor A-level grades and no backup plan. “That was a change in my life, realising you can’t just bet the farm on one outcome and expect the world is going to lay rose petals on your path to greatness,” he has said. He got into Ealing College of Higher Education (now the University of West London) to study hospitality management, emerging with a job in business publishing. (It was at college that he met his wife, Susie; the couple, who have two sons, are known for their devotion to each other.)   He’s such an easy man to like – he’s not pompous, he’s great company  Steven Norris    Cleverly’s friends describe him as self-deprecating, readily admitting what he doesn’t know, but not lacking confidence. Knocking on doors as a new Tory activist before the 2001 election, he was struck by black voters’ hostility to voting Conservative. The memo he wrote about how to overcome that found its way via friends of friends to Oliver Letwin, then a policy adviser to the Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith. Despite his political inexperience, Cleverly found himself in Duncan Smith’s office explaining his ideas for detoxifying the Tory brand. He worked with the then shadow cabinet minister Dominic Grieve, building links with faith groups and community associations, and was elected to the London assembly in 2008. The businessman and former Tory mayoral contender Steven Norris sat on the London Development Agency board with Cleverly and instantly took to him. “He’s such an easy man to like – he’s not pompous, he’s great company,” says Norris, who praises the “brilliant” job Cleverly did as foreign secretary in projecting a more affable impression of Britain abroad. But he didn’t come across as an embryonic party leader. “There’s no great Cleverly philosophy. He’s a man who has got where he probably never dreamed he would get in a British government, but has done so on the basis of just being a really nice guy, somebody who could disarm the most unwilling and aggressive recipient of his glad-handing.” This disarming quality has made him useful to four successive prime ministers. The close partnership Cleverly and Boris Johnson forged at City Hall endured well into parliament, after Cleverly won the safe seat of Braintree in Essex in 2015. Although they are very different in some ways, both are incurable optimists. “His instinct is to be a glass-three-quarters-full guy,” says Katwala, who notes that while Cleverly often describes Britain as the best country in the world in which to be black, and emphasises progress made over his lifetime, he doesn’t deny the continued existence of racism. “He has a lot of empathy with younger people [who feel differently].” Like Johnson, he is also a natural communicator, but sometimes careless with it. He once had to apologise for calling the Lib Dem Simon Hughes a “dick” on his blog; as a new MP, he was drawn into a game of “snog, marry, avoid” on the radio in which he said he would choose to snog the then home secretary, Theresa May. Aides say he will often end a meeting with a joke, usually at his own expense. But the tasteless “date rape” remark, plus an incident where he was forced to deny calling the Stockton North constituency “a shit-hole” in parliament, suggest he has yet to learn when to keep it for the officers’ mess. His politics are, however, less crude than his language. His backing for Brexit in 2016 seemingly stemmed from his enthusiasm for free markets and free trade, but he was never “wild-eyed” about it, says a fellow MP. That flexibility made him useful to May, who made him deputy party chair in 2018 before sending him to the Department for Exiting the EU in 2019 for one last doomed attempt to push through her Brexit deal. In the ensuing leadership contest, Cleverly precociously announced that he would run before swiftly withdrawing and backing his old ally Johnson – who duly made him co-chair of the party (alongside Queen Camilla’s nephew, Ben Elliot.) But the partnership didn’t work out. After the 2019 election, he was demoted to the Foreign Office, serving under Dominic Raab and then Liz Truss. He returned to cabinet as a caretaker education secretary after Boris Johnson resigned in July 2022, holding the fort through a leadership contest. When Truss won, she made him foreign secretary, a job he initially kept under Rishi Sunak and didn’t want to leave, at first, for the Home Office. Civil servants, aides and ministers describe a diligent and popular minister, if not a particularly visionary one. “He gets on with people, praises them and works with them, rather than shouting at them,” says one former colleague of Cleverly at the Foreign Office. “How much original thought there is there, I don’t know. But when you’re looking for a steady pair of hands, that’s what he was.” Having covered policing during his London assembly days, he has worked hard in recent weeks to heal a rift with the Metropolitan police caused by his predecessor accusing them of going soft on leftwing protesters. But an early attempt to cool the anti-immigrant rhetoric, in an interview where he cautioned against getting fixated on the Rwanda policy, went down badly with MPs worried about a resurgent Nigel Farage – and hasn’t been repeated. It was a reminder that, whatever his instincts, ultimately he serves a prime minister running out of political room to manoeuvre. Cleverly has been through similarly challenging times perhaps once before, at the Foreign Office. He wasn’t the lead minister on Afghanistan during Britain’s shambolic 2021 retreat from Kabul, which saw Afghans who had worked closely with British troops abandoned to their fate, and a subsequent select committee report (which blamed Foreign Office failure to anticipate a Taliban resurgence, plus ministers’ failure to challenge the assurances they were given) did not attach blame to him. But it was a chastening time for the department as a whole – and one from which he may have learned lessons. “He knew what his job was, which was to ask the best questions he could of officials and try to make sure that what they were telling him was OK actually was,” says one source who worked with Cleverly subsequently and describes him as charming but “very directional – not afraid to tell people what he wants”.   Related: James Cleverly facing calls to resign after joke about date rape drug   That period was also tough for more personal reasons: in December 2021, his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, leaving him openly distraught. For much of 2022, he supported her through gruelling treatment while his day job became a dizzying carousel of leadership contests. Although loyal to Johnson until the end, Cleverly was by then also part of the “Greenwich set” of free-market Tories all living near each other in south London, including his Foreign Office boss Truss and her old friend Kwasi Kwarteng. After Johnson resigned in July 2022, Cleverly set up camp in Truss’s kitchen to work the phones for her leadership bid. Although the recent parliamentary revolt against his Rwanda bill ultimately fizzled out, he cannot have enjoyed seeing Truss join the rebels on an issue fast becoming a test run for the next leadership contest. Facing down the revolt is likely to cost Cleverly support on the right. But can he manage not to alienate the moderate MPs now considering supporting him while overseeing the most toxic issue in government? “Ultimately, it will depend what the choices are. Colleagues recognise that if you are in the Home Office it’s a rotten place to be: you are going to have to take some difficult decisions,” says one likely supporter. “If, however, you’re better than the worst choice, you get a tick in the box for that.” Careers in politics were founded on less. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "Senior Labour figures have been left annoyed and perplexed by Rachel Reeves’s surprise announcement that the party will not reinstate a cap on bankers’ bonuses if it wins the next election.\nThe shadow chancellor said on Wednesday that she had “no intention” of bringing back the cap, introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to limit annual payouts to twice a banker’s salary, saying she wanted to be the “champion” of a thriving financial services industry.\nBut her shift in position has frustrated some of her colleagues. One shadow cabinet minister said: “We’ve spent the last year and a bit saying what a terrible decision it was for the Tories to scrap the cap in the middle of a cost of living crisis. What has changed?”\nAnother source said: “I’m just not sure what the point of this is. It will be really unpopular with exactly the sort of voters we need to win over, including in the ‘red wall’.”\nA third added: “We’ve given quite a bit of reassurance already to businesses. I don’t really understand the nervousness around this one.”\nIn 2022, the then chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced that he would be removing the rule as part of his now infamous mini-budget during Liz Truss’s short tenure as prime minister. It was one of the few of Truss’s policies to be kept under Rishi Sunak’s leadership, with the new rules coming into force in October last year.\nThe move received widespread criticism for rewarding bankers and failing to address cost-of-living concerns affecting households across the UK. However, Reeves’s decision to continue allowing unlimited payouts to bankers is a significant shift for Labour.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Reeves, a former Bank of England economist, said: “The cap on bankers’ bonuses was brought in in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances.\n“But that has gone now and we don’t have any intention of bringing that back. And as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.”\nLabour has previously criticised the Conservatives for removing the cap, saying it was “out of touch” with the British public. Just three months ago, after the lifting of the cap, Reeves criticised the move “in the midst of their cost of living crisis”. She added: “It tells you everything you need to know about this government.”\nOne senior union source described Reeves’s decision as the “wrong call that risks misreading the mood of the country”.\nSpeaking to reporters in Westminster, Labour’s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, said he stood by his earlier criticism of the decision to remove the bonus cap, but also avoided any direct criticism of Reeves and her decision.\n“We absolutely also believe in fairness, and so we were right to oppose the lifting of the cap on bankers’ bonuses at the time. I said it was a further demonstration of an economically illiterate, morally bankrupt Tory party,” he said. “I’m not going to shift my view on that. But you’ve got to look at the balance.”\nThis involved, he said, creating confidence for banks to invest while also “making sure that we never return to a situation where bankers behave inappropriately, and risk the wider economy, like we saw with the financial crash”.\nA Labour spokesperson defended the move, rejecting claims the party had U-turned or misled the public on its position. “We said at the time we didn’t think it was a priority. The decision was taken by the government and we don’t have any plans to bring it back.”\nShe said Labour wanted to offer businesses “stability, certainty and a clear path forward”. Other Labour insiders said Labour was already planning a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, abolishing non-dom tax status and bringing in VAT on school fees.\nOne said: “When it comes to the politics of this, these are the fights we think we can have with the Conservatives and win with the public. Everybody in the shadow cabinet and beyond knows that Rachel’s priority is demonstrating that Labour is as pro-worker as it is pro-business.”\nMomentum, a grassroots organisation of the party’s left wing, said: “This is a terrible decision totally out of touch with Labour’s values and public opinion. For over 40 years our economic model has sucked wealth from the country and enriched a few in the City. It even crashed the economy in 2008. Yet instead of learning the lessons from New Labour’s failures, Starmer and Reeves seem determined to repeat them.”\nLabour said on Tuesday that it planned to cut swathes of red tape in the financial services sector, while “unashamedly championing” the industry. In a 24-page document, seen by the Guardian, Labour has promised to cut 10,000 pages of regulations and ruled out a windfall tax on bank profits.\nThe party will formally announce its plans to harness the strengths of the financial sector to City bosses at its business conference in London on Thursday."

        "content": "Labour is overhauling its outreach efforts to British Indians, amid concern that the party’s support among the country’s largest ethnic minority has slumped in recent years. Keir Starmer’s party has taken a series of measures designed to reconnect with British Indians, including hiring two community outreach volunteers, revamping the Labour Friends of India group and organising a trip to India for two of its senior shadow ministers. There is growing evidence that Labour has lost the support of people of Indian descent. In 2010, 61% of British Indians said they supported Labour, but a survey seen by the Guardian shows by 2019 that figure had dropped to just 30%. One party official said: “We’ve taken Indian voters for granted for years, but it’s becoming increasingly obvious they are going elsewhere and we need to do something about that.” A party spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer’s changed Labour party is back in the service of working people and continues to engage with people of all background and faiths – including our Indian communities.” The measures being taken by party supporters include setting up a new group called Labour Indians to organise community events and target messages to British Indians on social media. Krish Raval, the group’s chair, said: “As a canvassing umbrella initiative focused on event organisation and social media dissemination, we’re looking to serve the widest group of stakeholders to ensure a Labour victory.” Two volunteers have been hired to work with the group, with part of their work focused on briefing Labour parliamentary candidates on issues of importance to India. On Sunday the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, will travel to Delhi and Mumbai on a five-day trip also designed to demonstrate the party is not hostile to Indian interests. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group in the UK, and the largest minority-ethnic group. For years nearly two-thirds of British Indians supported Labour, in line with other minority-ethnic groups. But that has fallen sharply in recent years, with a new survey from the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe showing that in 2019 only 30% voted for the opposition party, not many more than the 24% who voted Conservative. Experts say the shift has come about partly for socioeconomic reasons and partly for religious ones. As British Indians have become richer in recent years, survey data shows their attitudes have become more conservative. Meanwhile, the rise of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) in India has fuelled a more assertive conservatism among Indians in the UK. The UK in a Changing Europe survey shows that most Hindus who voted in the 2019 election supported the Tories, which was not the case for Muslim, Sikh or Buddhist voters. These long-term trends were exacerbated by Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour party, given his support for an independent Kashmir – a view that is highly unpopular among Indian Hindus. In 2019, activists for the BJP actively campaigned for the Tories in more than 40 seats across the UK, fuelling accusations of Indian government meddling in British democracy. Senior Labour figures worry that having Rishi Sunak as Britain’s first Hindu prime minister could increase the trend. Focus groups carried out late last year among first-, second- and third-generation Indians by the consultancy Public First showed the problem facing Labour. One participant said Sunak’s position showed the “tables were turning” for British Indians, while another commented: “It’s really good how he’s brought the Indian community into the traditions of 10 Downing Street.” James Frayne, a founding partner at Public First, said: “We found these groups to be much more positive towards Rishi Sunak than the average, predominantly white British swing voter group.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-02-01T06:00:42+00:00",
        "content": "Ministers should have to swear an oath to uphold ethical standards in public life after years of scandals and declining trust in the government, a new cross-party commission has found. The group, whose members include the former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, and Helen MacNamara, a former government ethics chief, set out 100 recommendations aimed at fixing problems with the standards system. One of its key proposals would involve a new code for ministers applied in law, which they would have to swear to uphold on taking office. The commission, funded by the Joseph Rowntree trust, said a revised ministerial code should be subject to oversight by an independent watchdog, which could initiate investigations and recommend sanctions for wrongdoing. The prime minister should retain discretion over whether to implement these, including dismissal. Ministers are supposed to abide by the Nolan principles of selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership, and to uphold the ministerial code. However, its enforcement is entirely a matter for the prime minister, with input from his adviser on ministerial interests. This allowed Priti Patel, the former home secretary, to keep her job after Boris Johnson ignored a finding from his adviser, Sir Alex Allan, that she had bullied staff, leading to the aide’s resignation. Other ministers investigated under the system in recent years include Johnson and Rishi Sunak. Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, is a former government ethics chief who oversaw the running of the propriety and ethics team from 2012 to 2018. The report is likely to be examined closely by Labour, which has its own proposals for overhauling governance, including a new ethics and integrity commission charged with responsibility for ministers’ ethical standards and conflicts of interest. However, some party insiders are sceptical about whether the party will get around to an overhaul of the system or measures to increase transparency given other priorities of a first term in power. The Conservatives have shown less appetite for overhauling the standards system, with Johnson rejecting proposals to give the independent adviser on ministerial interests the ability to initiate their own investigations into ministers. MacNamara, who was in charge of propriety and ethics in the government in 2018 before becoming deputy cabinet secretary, said it was “not good enough to rely on goodwill or good intentions – we’re recommending stronger systems and safeguards to protect what matters”. She added: “The civil service is an extraordinary institution that has served the country very well but it is now under serious strain. It’s time for a proper debate about how to set it up for success in the future.” The commission also recommended stripping the prime minister of some power to appoint peers and give out honours without independent approval. Successive prime ministers, including Johnson and Liz Truss, have been allowed to appoint numerous peers to the House of Lords, despite being removed from office by their parties. Other recommendations included training on standards in public life for MPs and peers, with appropriate sanctions if not attended. The commission also suggested increasing the House of Commons’ ability to determine what it would debate and when it would sit, including approving being prorogued, to stop situations such as Johnson unlawfully suspending parliament in 2019."

        "content": "Sometimes you have to wonder whether politicians live in the same world as us. Breathe the same air, talk the same language. Almost as if election is immediately followed by a spell at idiot school. To implant that sense of effortless superiority that places their own experience on a higher plane to the rest of us. Their punishment is to be perpetually misunderstood. Take George Freeman. A former Tory minister unable to get by on £120,000 a year. It’s only the Just Giving fundraiser I started this week that’s keeping him off the streets. Pray for George.\nBut Freeman is far from the only one. On Wednesday, it was hard to find any minister or former minister not hellbent on taking the public for mugs. Maybe they just had spare capacity in their condescension quota for the month. Start again afresh on the first day of February. Or could it be almost everyone has given up. They know change is coming and have given up even pretending to take the job seriously.\nUp in Scotland we had the former first minister giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. Since Nicola Sturgeon resigned from the top job in March she has spent more time than she would have wanted being questioned by police about the SNP’s finances. No one still seems to know how a luxury motorhome came to be parked outside her mother-in-law’s house in Dunfermline. But at the very least, it’s given Nicola some practice in answering awkward questions.\n\n Related: No minutes kept of Nicola Sturgeon’s ‘gold command’ meetings, Covid inquiry told \n\nThe lead counsel for the inquiry, Jamie Dawson, began with Sturgeon’s missing WhatsApp messages. What was it about Covid that led so many senior politicians to delete all their WhatsApps? That was a side-effect Chris Whitty never warned the rest of us about. Specifically, Dawson wanted to know why the former first minister had told Channel 4 in 2021 that she would hand over all her messages to any inquiry when she knew that she had already deleted them.\n“Ah that,” said Nicola. She was sorry if there had been any misunderstanding, but she had only wanted to keep things simple for the little people. Because all that had happened was that she had saved the messages she thought would be relevant. Not that everything else had been deleted. It had merely not been retained in a way that could be retrieved.\nBasically, she had been doing everyone a favour. Saving people the effort of going through messages asking people to amend her Tesco shopping order. In other words, Nicola had merely been doing the inquiry’s job for it. Because who better to decide what was relevant than Sturgeon herself? Really, she should have been made chair of the Scottish leg of the inquiry and let Lady Hallett take a few weeks off. So nothing to see here, then … Er, no. Nicola. Back in 2021 you lied to a TV journalist.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNicola looked shocked. Her sentences became longer and more inarticulate. Openness and transparency had always been her guiding principles. If anything she had overshared with the Scottish people as first minister. “I knew I had operated in line with a policy I had operated in line with,” she said. No one was any the wiser.\nWe moved on to a surviving WhatsApp from a civil servant describing a culture of plausible deniability. Sturgeon shrugged. She could plausibly deny any plausible deniability. She certainly couldn’t recall any instructions to destroy evidence. That would be abhorrent. Someone might have said it as a joke. That was it, a joke. Ha ha. Then she had misremembered stuff in the past.\n“I make no apology for saying that Boris Johnson was the wrong person to be prime minister,” she said. Many of us could agree on that. But there had also been times when she wished she hadn’t been first minister. She had just tried to be the best version of herself. Her voice caught and she dabbed her eyes as she recalled the responsibility. This was the human Nicola. The one she normally reserves for private consumption only.\nThe rest of the evidence could be filed alongside plausible deniability. She had always wanted to be inclusive in her decision-making. Couldn’t understand why the details of what was discussed were missing. Had definitely never tried to use the pandemic to her personal advantage. That would be the last thing she would do. Had merely tried to stop Scotland making the same mistakes as England. Believable? Barely. Then she hadn’t had countless piss-ups, she hadn’t ignored the scientific evidence and she hadn’t lost billions in PPE fraud to mates. So there was that.\nBack in London, James Cleverly was also struggling with language during an appearance before the home affairs select committee. Jimmy Dimly’s command of language often leaves a lot to be desired. His natural speech is pure bollocks. There was no backlog of migrants to be processed, he insisted. To suggest otherwise was a lie. There was just an orderly queue. A bit like at a supermarket checkout. He also said that sending one person to Rwanda would prove the whole scheme was worthwhile. He thinks we’re all as dim as him.\nRishi Sunak was also reduced to talking nonsense at prime minister’s questions. Mostly because there’s nothing sensible left for him to say. Other than, “I give up. Let’s have an election.” Rish! has run out of road and no longer bothers to disguise his impotence. The only reason the Northern Ireland deal is going through is thanks to a £3bn bung and the belief that the Tories won’t be in power in a year’s time. So no one’s kicking up a fuss over alignment with the EU. That’s now priced in.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIt was almost as if Keir Starmer had also got fed up with the one-sidedness of his exchanges with Sunak. His performance was no better than phoned in. Still enough to win easily, but nothing very inspirational. Trading on your opponent’s uselessness doesn’t win hearts and minds.\nRishi had nothing. No answer to inevitable pleas for distressed Tory ministers. No answer to people’s mortgage payments going up. Other than everyone should just sod off, stop bothering him and extend their mortgage into retirement. Great, we can all carry on working till we die. Thanks Rish!. Thanks Liz. Sunak shrugged. Phil from Iceland could also do one. Taking the piss out of a member of the public is bad politics. A sure sign the game is up. The Tory benches were half empty long before the end. Send for the whisky and barbiturates.\nThere was one sign of life. A very primitive form of life. Barely sentient. Someone who makes Jimmy Dimly look like an intellectual giant. The one, the only Andrea Leadsom. No one lowers the stupidity bar further than her. She was out on the airwaves celebrating the four-year anniversary of Brexit. Luckily, her short-term memory is shot, so she can’t remember what she said last year. Now she was insisting we should be cheering on rising food prices as a symbol of our liberation. We’re going to miss her when she’s gone. A Brexit giant …"

        "content": "A minister has told British businesses that “some friction” when trading with the EU after Brexit is the price to pay for being a sovereign state again. On the fourth anniversary of Britain officially leaving the EU, Andrea Leadsom said UK firms should “adapt” to the change in trade rules, after new checks were brought in on food, drink and some agricultural products, suggesting they should not buy goods from Europe. When asked what the successes of Brexit were, Leadsom, a health minister and fierce Brexiter, told Nick Ferrari on LBC: “I’m hugely delighted at Brexit. We have our sovereignty back, we’re in control of our money, laws and borders. The NHS has considerably more than £350m a week and we’ve signed up to 70 trade deals.” But after hearing of the difficulties a British florist faced when trying to import flowers from the Netherlands because of the additional checks, Leadsom told Sky News: “Leaving the single market was always going to have implications … I’m just saying that businesses need to adapt to meet the changing environment. “I can certainly remember as business secretary myself back in 2019, every day meeting with businesses, roundtables, to help them to prepare for us actually leaving the European Union and to understand the additional checks that would be required. “So businesses are used to the costs of doing business. I understand that today is a big news story because it is something that finally has come home to roost. But the fact of the matter remains that businesses have huge opportunities with other parts of the world which are the direct benefit of us leaving the European Union.” Speaking about trading relations, the minister told Times Radio: “What that does mean is that there is some friction in trade. However, we also have huge trading arrangements with other countries around the world … so there is a huge new opportunity for the UK at the same time as continuing to trade, albeit with some friction, which is the price you pay for leaving the single market and for being a sovereign state again.” On the eve of the new arrangements coming into force, the Commons environment, food and rural affairs committee wrote to the environment secretary, Steve Barclay, expressing concerns over the new post-Brexit checks. The committee chair said: “We remain concerned about the location of the physical checks that will be undertaken for commercial loads,” adding that it posed “potentially serious biosecurity risks” to the UK. Goods from Britain have faced similar controls from the EU since it left the bloc’s single market at the start of 2021, but the UK has repeatedly put off checks in the other direction. Ministers have sought to allay concerns as the new post-Brexit checks on food and drink imports come into force. The long-delayed rules are part of the UK government’s introduction of a series of checks this year. Fears have been expressed about disruption to supply chains, with MPs also warning that the new border regime could present “serious biosecurity risks” to the UK. The home secretary, James Cleverly, played down the concerns, saying there would be “no interruption” to food on supermarket shelves as a result of the new rules. Noting the anniversary of Britain’s official departure, a leading French MEP said “nothing has been a success” since.  Il y a quatre ans, le Royaume-Uni nous quittait. Tous les sondages depuis montrent le drame créé par le Brexit.Pouvoir d’achat, sécurité sociale, influence mondiale, protection des frontières : rien, absolument rien, n’a été un succès. Les populistes ont menti aux Britanniques.— Valérie Hayer (@ValerieHayer) January 31, 2024  Valérie Hayer, the president of the Renew Europe group in the European parliament, wrote: “All the polls since show the drama created by Brexit. “Purchasing power, social security, global influence, border protection: nothing, absolutely nothing, has been a success. “The populists lied to the British.”"

Instead the document left Northern Ireland “continuing to be governed in part by laws we don’t need and can’t change”, he said.\n\n\nThe only thing which has changed today is that the DUP have, sadly, become Protocol implementers. pic.twitter.com/WZcoCX8vkE— Jim Allister (@JimAllister) January 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.38pm GMT \n\nTory MPs in the strongly pro-Brexit European Research Group are meeting to discuss the “Safeguarding the Union” deal offered to the DUP. Jon Craig from Sky News says Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg praised what the government had done.\n\n\nNot many at ERG council of war on NI deal so far.

Early arrivals Theresa Villiers, IDS, Bernard Jenkin, John Redwood, Danny Kruger, Desmond Swayne & Lords David Frost & Peter Lilley. Then division bell rings & off they go!\n\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg tells reporters as he arrives at ERG meeting on NI: “I think the government’s done well.” Priti Patel & Bill Cash arrive. Big Gavin Robinson of The DUP also enters the room & briefs the Tory MPs.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.55pm GMT\n\n\n 4.09pm GMT \nDublin not expecting EU objections to new trade rules for Northern Ireland\n\nMicheál Martin, the Irish foreign minister and tánaiste (deputy PM), has said that he does not expect the European Commission to object to the proposals in the Safeguarding the Union document setting out terms of the No 10/DUP deal to revise the Windsor framework.\nSpeaking after meeting the political parties in Belfast, he said:\n\nI think the EU commission will look at this, I think that’s the whole purpose of the joint committee and, indeed, the various mechanisms that are in the Windsor framework is to go through issues as they arise, but I do not anticipate any particular difficulties in respect of the EU side.\n\nAsked what would protecting the EU single market if goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland were not checked, he said:\n\nFor goods that are going from the UK into Northern Ireland that are staying in Northern Ireland, we’ve always been of the view that the more streamlined and seamless one can make that, the better all round because we want any of the frameworks we put in place to work for industry, business and jobs in Northern Ireland.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.24pm GMT\n\n\n 3.54pm GMT \n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said she would not bring back the cap on bankers’ bonuses (see 8.57am) in an interview to mark the publication of Labour’s plan for financial services. The party says it includes “a commitment to modernise the regulatory burden on the industry that can obstruct competitiveness and growth, including the Financial Conduct Authority’s 10,000 page regulatory handbook”.\n\n\n\n 3.41pm GMT \nDominic Raab acted unlawfully by ignoring advice on raising legal aid fees, high court finds\n\nThe lord chancellor acted unlawfully and irrationally when taking the decision not to increase criminal legal aid fees for solicitors in England and Wales by 15%, which was the minimum recommendation of an independent review it commissioned, the high court has found.\nThe Law Society for England and Wales brought a judicial review against the decision, which came amid a 15% increase for barristers and an exodus of solicitors from criminal legal aid work.\nIn a judgment published on Wednesday, Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Jay found in favour of the solicitors’ representative body on two of its four argued grounds and ordered that the decision should be retaken.\nThey said that Alex Chalk’s predecessor as lord chancellor, Dominic Raab, acted irrationally by not asking whether increasing fees by less than 15% could still achieve the aims and objectives of the independent review into criminal legal aid and by not undertaking any modelling to see whether they could be met “in particular ensuring the sustainability of criminal legal aid”.\nThe judges said that they had been presented with an “impressive, compelling, body of evidence” which showed “the system is slowly coming apart at the seams”. They said:\n\nUnless there are significant injections of funding in the relatively near future, any prediction along the lines that the system will arrive in due course at a point of collapse is not overly pessimistic.\n\nThe Law Society president, Nick Emmerson, expressed delight at the decision but said it was imperative the government implemented the 15% increase as soon as possible. He said: \nWe may have won the court battle but it’s the public who will lose out in custody suites and courtrooms across the country unless the government takes immediate action to stop the exodus of duty solicitors from the profession.\n\n1,400 duty solicitors have left since 2017 because the work is not financially viable.\nWe are already seeing that there simply aren’t enough solicitors to represent suspects at police stations and magistrates’ courts day and night across the country. This situation will only get worse with potentially dangerous consequences for society.\nThe imbalance between the defence and the prosecution will continue to grow and public trust in the criminal justice system will continue to fail.\n\n\n\n\n 3.32pm GMT \nGovernment's trans guidance for schools in England 'will erase decades of progress', campaigners claim\n\nA coalition of charities and human rights groups say they “strongly oppose” the government’s draft guidance on how schools in England should treat transgender students, and are calling for it to be redrawn.\nThe group including Stonewall, Liberty, Amnesty International UK and Mermaids, a charity supporting trans young people, say the guidance “seeks to deny the existence of transgender pupils” and could lead to them being forcibly outed.\nIn a joint statement they say:\n\nThis approach will erase decades of progress in making schools places that value difference and reject discrimination. It hampers teachers’ ability to tackle bullying and ultimately risks causing more harm and exclusion of trans young people.\nSchools desperately need guidance that offers practical advice on creating school environments that support trans pupils to thrive.\nWe are calling on the government to listen to LGBT+ youth and inclusive educators, withdraw the guidance and rethink their approach.\n\nJust Like Us, an LBGT+ charity that works with schools, is also advising schools not to use the guidance in its current form. “The draft guidance is unclear, impractical and many questions have been raised over its legal standing,” the charity said.\nThe draft guidance, published late last year, advised schools that they had no “general duty” to let students change their preferred names or uniforms – known as social transitioning – and stressed that parents should be involved where possible.\n\n\n\n 3.25pm GMT \nWales's journey towards independence speeding up, Plaid Cymru leader claims\n\nThe leader of Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, has said that the “journey” towards independence is “speeding up” after a commission concluded that breaking away from the union was a viable option for the country.\nAp Iorwerth described the report from the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales as “groundbreaking” and called on Welsh people to be “curious, bold and brave” about the possibility of independence.\nThe Plaid leader, who is making a keynote speech on the issue in Cardiff this evening, told the Guardian:\n\nI absolutely understand people who see the UK as being some sort of comfort blanket. But it takes a bit of boldness and more curiosity to turn that question on its head and ask, well, how much better could things be if we switch from dependency to taking our fate into our own hands. Staying where we are isn’t risk-free – look at the poverty within many of our communities.\n\nHe said he did not want Wales to be isolated but perhaps to be part of a new union of the British Isles or the Celtic nations. He went on:\n\nTo me, redesigning Britain is what it’s about. This is a hugely exciting time and I want more people to come with us on the journey.\nAlso, there’s the reality that if Scotland becomes independent and if Northern Ireland and the Republic reunify, you are left with England and Wales, with Wales being a very, very small partner in that rump of the UK. I think it will dawn on people quickly that that could be bad for Wales. Things could change because of decisions not made by us. We need to prepare for all outcomes. We have to be alive to the possibility that the timescale might not be entirely of our own making.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.29pm GMT\n\n\n 2.53pm GMT \nBrexiters and unionists raise concerns as MPs largely back No 10/DUP deal to reform Windsor framework\n\nMPs broadly backed the No 10/DUP deal to reform the way the Windsor framework operates, set out in a lengthy and complicated command paper when Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, presented it in a statement to the House of Commons. If Downing Street was fearing a major backlash, it has not happened, and the restoration of power sharing at Stormont is still all set to happen very soon.\nBut there were concerns raised about the deal, by two groups of MPs.\nAt a meeting on Monday night Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, secured backing for the deal from the party’s executive.\nBut he does not have unanimous support and in the Commons at least two of his eight MPs expressed concerns that the deal would not stop Northern Ireland being bound by EU law.\nThe most outspoken (as usual) was Sammy Wilson, who said:\n\nWhen the Northern Ireland assembly sits, ministers and assembly members will be expected by law to adhere to and implement laws which are made in Brussels, which they had no say over and no ability to amend, and no ability to stop. This is a result of this spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying government, refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland.\n\nAnd Carla Lockhart suggested there was more work to be done because Northern Ireland remained bound by EU single market rules, and the customs code still applied.\nSeveral Tory Brexiters, such as Priti Patel and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, raised a question also raised by Wilson: what will happen if, in future, the UK government does want to pass legislation diverging from EU law that might necessitate the reimposition of checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland?\nThis is the key issue, and one that Boris Johnson was tweeting about earlier (see 11.33am), because for Brexiters it is an article of faith that the UK should diverge in this way.\nHeaton-Harris replied several times using the same formula. He told\n\nI can tell him absolutely that this agreed package of measures will not change the freedoms and powers we have secured through Brexit or through the Windsor framework. It will not reduce our ability to diverge nor our commitment to do so should it be in the interest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThis partially satisfied the Brexiters, although it sounded like a fudge, and Heaton-Harris never fully explained what would happen – under the procedure highlighted by Rees-Mogg (see 1.59am) – if the government did want to diverge in this way.\nIf the Conservatives were expecting to be in power for another five years, with the government diverging away merrily, this would be a problem, because the Brexiters would not be happy with the answer they got today.\nBut they don’t, and as a consequence – judging, at least, by what they were saying in the Commons – they don’t have the appetite for a big fight.\n\nUpdated at 3.31pm GMT\n\n\n 2.22pm GMT \n\nIn his response in the Commons to Chris Heaton-Harris, Hilary Benn, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said Labour would be voting for the legislation to implement the “safeguarding the union” changes. He said:\n\nI have always made it clear that we believe in Northern Ireland’s place in the internal market of the United Kingdom and that we support any practical measures that reinforce this which are consistent with the Windsor framework, which we also support, and which have the support of nationalists as well as unionists. On that basis, we will vote for the legislation.\n\nHe also said that negotiating the deal was “a great achievement” by Heaton-Harris.\n\nUpdated at 3.32pm GMT\n\n\n 2.12pm GMT \n\nThe Heaton-Harris statement is now over. In the Commons Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, has just told MPs that tomorrow they will debate regulations to implement the measures in the Northern Ireland deal.\n\n\n\n 2.08pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP (a Northern Ireland nationalist party), asked if Heaton-Harris backed reform to the Good Friday agreement to ensure “no one party can pull them down again”.\nHeaton-Harris said this was a matter for MLAs at Stormont.\n\n\n\n 1.59pm GMT \n\nThis is what the command paper says would happen if the UK government wants to pass legislation that would further diverge from EU law, creating a risk that border controls on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland might have to change.\n\nWe will ensure that whenever parliament is considering new legislation, it has the information needed about any impacts on the internal market and measures necessary to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the internal market, to decide how to proceed.\nTo ensure complete transparency, the government will legislate to require that a minister in charge of a bill must assess whether or not it has an impact on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, if so, make a statement to parliament setting out whether the legislation would have significant adverse implications for Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. Where primary legislation does carry such implications for the internal market, the government will set out any measures it proposes to take to protect the internal market.\n\nIn the Commons Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, another leading Brexiter, asked Heaton-Harris to give an example of when this mechanism might be deployed. Heaton-Harris was unable to give one.\n\nUpdated at 2.15pm GMT\n\n\n 1.52pm GMT \n\nPriti Patel, the former home secretary, and another leading Brexiter, asks Heaton-Harris to confirm that the UK still has the full ability to diverge from EU laws if it wants.\nHeaton-Harris says that is the case. He repeats the point about how the deal will not affect the UK’s ability to diverge, or its commitment to do so if that is in the UK’s interests.\n\n\n\n 1.50pm GMT \nHeaton-Harris says he does not expect to see Irish reunification in his lifetime\n\nRichard Drax, a Tory Brexiter, says “whispering” from Sinn Féin about reunification has been unhelpful. Can the government say that will never happen?\nHeaton-Harris says he has to be careful, because as secretary of state he is the person who would authorise a border poll. But he says that he expects Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK for the rest of his lifetime.\nHe says the Good Friday agreement says reunification would only happen with the consent of both communities.\nHeaton-Harris is 56.\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm GMT\n\n\n 1.46pm GMT \nHeaton-Harris says deal will not stop government diverging from EU law 'should it be in interests of UK'\n\nSammy Wilson (DUP) asked if the UK government would still have the power to diverge from EU laws, and implement laws that would not apply to Northern Ireland.\nHeaton-Harris says this package of laws will not reduce the UK’s ability to diverge, or the government’s “commitment to do so should it be in the interests of the United Kingdom”.\nHe says, if there is a possibility of a measure having a diverse impact on GB/NI trade, the government would have to publish a ministerial statement justifying this.\n\nUpdated at 4.48pm GMT\n\n\n 1.44pm GMT \n\nSir Bill Cash, another leading Brexiter, asked what the deal would do to ensure EU laws affecting Northern Ireland could be blocked.\nHeaton-Harris said that deal includes changes to the Withdrawal Act that will strengthen the “Stormont lock” mechanism that provides a democratic safeguard.\n\n\n\n 1.41pm GMT \n\nIn the Commons Theresa Villiers, a former Northern Ireland secretary and a leading Brexiter, pointed out that the new deal did not take Northern Ireland out of the single market. She asked if the government was still committed to negotiating with the EU to amend the Windsor framework to restore democratic control to law making in every part of the UK.\nIn response, Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal does contain changes affecting the framework.\n\nUpdated at 1.52pm GMT\n\n\n 1.33pm GMT \nWhat command paper on Northern Ireland, setting out details of DUP deal, actually says\n\nThis is from PA Media on what the command paper says:\n\nIt commits to replacing the green lane, which currently requires a percentage of goods to be checked, with a “UK internal market system” that will govern the movement of goods that will remain within the UK.\nThe paper said that would ensure there would be “no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks”.\nThe paper adds: “This will ensure the smooth flow of goods that are moving within the UK internal market.”\nThe red lane for transporting goods from GB to NI and on into the EU single market will remain, but the command paper offers measures aimed at reducing the volume of trade required to use that red-tape heavy route.\nThe move to reduce post-Brexit checks on GB-NI trade would represent a change to the current EU/UK Windsor framework agreement and therefore would require Brussels approval. It is understood decisions on implementing the changes are expected to be examined within the existing EU/UK joint committee framework in the time ahead.\nAs well as moves to cut Brexit bureaucracy on Irish Sea trade, the command papers includes a series of measures aimed at providing assurances around Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom.\nLegislation will be tabled with the purpose of “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional status underpinned by, among other provisions, the Acts of Union.”\nThe paper said: “The legislation will affirm parliament’s sovereignty over all matters in Northern Ireland, and address the concern that Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the union has been weakened by the creation of specific arrangements for trade in goods.”\nThe government has also pledged to amend domestic law, specifically section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, to affirm the fact that new EU laws will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland, and must first be subject to democratic oversight by the Stormont assembly.\nThe oversight procedures already outlined in the Windsor framework include the so-called Stormont brake mechanism that enables 30 or more MLAs to flag a concern about a new EU law planned to come into effect in Northern Ireland. The government is obliged to assess whether those concerns meet a threshold that could then result in the UK vetoing the application of the law in the region.\nThe command paper also includes commitments to ensure Northern Ireland goods will always be able to be sold in the GB market regardless of any divergence in EU and UK standards.\nIn respect of further UK divergence from EU standards, there is also a legal requirement that new legislation is assessed as to whether it “impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.\nIf it does there will be a statutory duty for the relevant minister to make a statement “considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market”.\nA requirement that saw certain goods sold in Northern Ireland to display a label stating “not for sale in the EU” will now to extend to cover the whole UK.\nThe government is also creating two new bodies. An UK east-west council will bring together representatives from government, business and the education sector from Northern Ireland and Great Britain to “identify opportunities for deepening connections between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in areas such as trade, transport, education and culture”.\nIntertrade UK will promote trade within the UK. Among its roles will be to proactively communicate with businesses that currently choose not to sell products in Northern Ireland and identify solutions that could enable them to expand their services to the region.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.42pm GMT\n\n\n 1.22pm GMT \nChris Heaton-Harris makes statement to MPs on deal with DUP\n\nChris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, has just finished making his statement to MPs about the deal with the DUP.\nThe details are set out in an 80-page command paper just published by the government.\n\n\n\n 1.20pm GMT \nPMQs - snap verdict\n\nRishi Sunak must be getting used to floundering at PMQs on the cost of living crisis, but today he was even weaker than usual. This probably won’t be remembered as a classic exchange, but it was one that Keir Starmer won comfortably by deploying three familiar tactics.\nFirst, Starmer started with a joke that was funny enough to be disarming, but sharp enough to make a political point. He referred to this story about the Tory MP George Freeman.\n\nOne of the most difficult experiences of any member of this house is speaking to those at the sharp end of this government’s cost-of-living crisis. So nobody could fail to be moved by the plight of [Freeman].\nHis mortgage has gone up £1,200 a month, he’s been forced to quit his dream job to pay for it. A Tory MP counting the cost of Tory chaos. After 14 years, have we finally discovered what they meant when they said ‘we’re all in this together’?\n\nStarmer then hammered away on the cost of living for the rest of the session. He repeatedly challenged Sunak to say how much the average cost of a mortgage was going up for someone coming off a fixed rate deal, and he deployed the “real person” card, asking Sunak to say how he would explain himself to Phil, an employee he met at Iceland, facing a £1,000-a- month rise in his mortgage.\nThere is not really a particularly good answer a PM can give in response to a question like this. For the election, the Tories have settled on the argument that they are committed to bringing down taxes, while Labour would put them up (even though they say they won’t). In the circumstances this is probably the best messaging available, and it is understandable why Sunak has chosen to stick with it.\nBut Labour’s decision to support the national insurance cut that came into force this week has made it harder for the Tories to deploy this line and so now, unable to attack Labour for opposing tax cuts, they are having a go at Labour for not actually adoring them. This was the theme a CCHQ press release on Monday criticising Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, for describing the tax cuts as being part of a “scorched earth” policy and it was a line deployed by Sunak today. It is not a compelling one; fiscal thought crime is not a terrible offence, particularly when the IMF agree with you.\nThere were two other aspects of Sunak’s performance that made things worse. First, on mortgage costs, he argued:\n\nSomeone on a typical mortgage of about £140,000 with 17 years left is currently paying around £800. As a result of the ability to extend their mortgage term or switch to a six-month interest-only mortgage they will be able to save hundreds of pounds.\n\nThis is not much consolation to Phil, or anyone else, because anyone using these options won’t be saving money at all; they will just be delaying repayments.\nAnd, second, Sunak referred to Phil from Iceland in a way that sounded patronising. Almost certainly, this was not what Sunak intended. But it is how it came across, and that’s gruesome.\nStarmer has repeatedly argued that Sunak is too out of touch to be a successful PM. Today’s PMQs made this charge ever more compelling, and this helps to explain why, according to Ipsos polling published yesterday, Starmer is opening up an ever bigger lead on best PM.\n\nUpdated at 1.56pm GMT\n\n\n 1.07pm GMT \nGovernment publishes details of new proposals for Northern Ireland\n\nThe government has published what it calls a command paper effectively setting out details of the deal aimed at restoring power sharing at Stormont.\nThe paper, which you can read here, includes a commitment to removing the post-Brexit green lane for checking goods shipped from Great Britain to final destinations in Northern Ireland.\nNo 10 says that the deal with the Democratic Unionist party contains “significant” changes to the Windsor framework’s operation.\nThe PM’s official spokesperson said:\n\nThis is our negotiation between the UK and the DUP, this is not about altering the fundamentals of the Windsor framework.\nWe do believe the changes we are implementing are significant and the DUP have made similar comments.\n\nPressed on the “significant” changes, he said that they were to the “operation of the framework”.\nHe declined to say whether talks have been held with the EU, saying he would not discuss “private conversations”.\nHe added:\n\nIt’s important to make clear that this was a negotiation between the UK and the DUP about ensuring the framework operates properly within the UK.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.12pm GMT\n\n\n 12.44pm GMT \n\nI have beefed up the earlier post at 12.02pm to include the full quote from Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker. He complained that MPs’ behaviour was getting worse at PMQs, and he suggested the approaching election was partly to blame.\n\n\n\n 12.37pm GMT \nSunak distances himself from David Cameron's suggestion UK might bring forward recognition of Palestinian state\n\nMichael Ellis (Con) asks if the PM agrees that any recognition of a Palestinian state can only come about as a result of negotiations between Israel and Palestine.\nSunak says recognition of Palestine would have to be part of a process. He suggests that many steps would have to come first, and he says the UK stands with Israel.\nThat sounded like a mild rebuke to David Cameron. Neither Ellis nor Sunak mentioned Cameron, and Cameron’s speech on this earlier this week did not explicitly contradict what Sunak was saying today. But Cameron was floating the idea of bringing forward the moment when the UK might recognise a Palestinian state – while Sunak seemed to be kicking the prospect back into the long grass.\nUPDATE: Ellis said:\n\nAll of us want to see a peaceful and demilitarised Palestinian state, however Hamas remain in control in large parts of Gaza, support is growing in the West Bank.\nNearly two-thirds of Palestinians in polling reject coexistence with Israel, and the Palestinian Authority has continued to promote hatred of Jews.\nDoes [the PM] agree that any recognition of a Palestinian state must address these issues and can only come about as part of a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians?\n\nAnd Sunak replied:\n\nThe government’s position is clear. [Ellis] is right that steps and conditions need to be put in place on this journey: first and foremost, the removal of Hamas from Gaza; a Palestinian-led government in Gaza and the West Bank; a concrete plan to reform and support the Palestinian Authority; a reconstruction plan for Gaza; and a two-state solution, which we have long supported. \nLet me be clear: we stand with Israel. The terrorist threat it faces must be eliminated and Israel’s lasting security must be guaranteed.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.08pm GMT\n\n\n 12.30pm GMT \n\nMarsha de Cordova (Lab) cites research saying half of employers exclude blind people. Will the PM have a meeting about creating a more inclusive workforce?\nSunak says he wants to see the workforce become more inclusive. The DWP is looking at this, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.28pm GMT \n\nDawn Butler (Lab) says people in public life should not act to obtain personal advantage. She says Sunak tweeted a link to an advert allowing the Tories to scrape data. (It was asking for email addresses.) Is Sunak confident he did not break the law?\nSunak says of course he didn’t.\n\nUpdated at 4.48pm GMT\n\n\n 12.27pm GMT \n\nJo Gideon (Con) asks Sunak to back community banking as an option.\nSunak says the Post Office Horizon scandal does not mean the Post Office does not provide a valuable service.\n\n\n\n 12.26pm GMT \n\nAndrew Bridgen (Ind) says Tony Blair promoted the Horizon system, which generated untold misery. He asks Sunak what he has promoted that has done the same.\nSunak says Bridgen was wrong to imply Covid vaccines are not safe.\n\n\n\n 12.25pm GMT \n\nSelaine Saxby (Con) asks about dental provision in Devon. She asks when the govenrment’s plan for dentistry is coming.\nSunak says more financial support is being delivered for this sector. But more needs to be done, he says. The dentistry recovery plan will be published soon, he says,\n\n\n\n 12.23pm GMT \n\nDehenna Davison (Con) asks if the PM agrees that one-punch manslaughter should be a specific offence. (Her father was killed this way, but she refers to a recent case where someone who killed in this manner received a light sentence.)\nSunak says the government will consider Davison’s call for a change in the law on this.\n\n\n\n 12.21pm GMT \n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, goes on bankers’ bonuses. Labour was right to oppose the plan to scrap the cap. But now they are in favour. That is shameful. Is the PM comforted by being no longer alone in being out of touch with public opinion.\nSunak says the government followed the recommendations of an independent regulator. He says Labour has no principles.\nFlynn says this was a result of Brexit. And Brexit red tape is pushing up food prices. He refers to “broken Brexit Britain”, and says the Tories have got Labour to endorse this too.\nSunak says the best thing the SNP could do to help people with the cost of living would be to stop Scotland being the highest-taxed place in the UK.\n\n\n\n 12.18pm GMT \nSunak ‘just doesn’t get how hard it is for people’, says Starmer, as he attacks prime minister over cost of mortgages\n\nStarmer says he did not expect Sunak to laugh at Phil. Sunak just does not get how hard it is for people. He is so detached. He cannot even fool his own MPs. George Freeman is exhausted, and wants opportunities outside parliament. Why won’t the PM just call an election?\nSunak says he is getting on with the plan. Just this week, he is tackling vaping, extending powers to pharmacies, and tax cuts are coming into force.\n\nUpdated at 12.23pm GMT\n\n\n 12.16pm GMT \n\nStarmer says Sunak should explain to Phil how paying an extra £1,000 a month will make him better off. Most people do not have that money available. This shows how out of touch Sunak is. And he says council tax is going up.\nSunak accuses Starmer of resorting to the “politics of envy”. Labour used to attack the government for lifting the bonus cap. But Labour has changed his position. Did Starmer mention that to Phil? This shows you cannot trust a word Starmer says.\n\nUpdated at 12.24pm GMT\n\n\n 12.14pm GMT \n\nStarmer asks about a worker he met at Iceland whose mortgage is going up £1,000 a month. If George Freeman MP, on £120,000, can’t afford this government, how can Phil from Iceland?\nSunak says inflation is going down. And people are benefiting from the tax cut coming into force this month. Did Starmer explain to Phil how he would have to pay for Labour’s £28bn spending spree.\n\nUpdated at 12.28pm GMT\n\n\n 12.12pm GMT \n\nStarmer asks the question again. For those coming off fixed rate mortgages, how much will their mortgages go up by?\nSunak says the measures in place announced by the chancellor last week will allow mortgages to stay essentially the same. He refers to Labour’s £28bn green plan and claims Ed Miliband said in an interview at the weekend the party did not need to say how it would pay for it.\n\nUpdated at 12.29pm GMT\n\n\n 12.10pm GMT \n\nStarmer says the government has put taxes up, and is only giving some of that back. And Sunak expects people to be dancing in the streets. How much are monthly payments going up?\nSunak says someone with a monthly mortage of £800 a month will be able to save money as a result of measures like allowing them to extend.\n\n\n\n 12.08pm GMT \n\nKeir Starmer says all sides need to work together to get Stormont up and running.\nAnd he says he too met the families of the Nottingham attack victims. He says it is impossible to express the horror of what they experienced.\nHe says one of the hardest jobs for MPs is speaking to people at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis. So no one won’t be moved by the plight of George Freeman, who had to give up his “dream job” as a minister because he could not afford his mortgage. Is this what they meant by ‘we’re all in it together’?\nSunak says, if Starmer cared about this, he would focus on what is being done. Taxes are being cut. But Starmer has described tax cuts as “salting the earth”, and Rachel Reeves has described them as a scorched-earth policy.\n\nUpdated at 12.30pm GMT\n\n\n 12.05pm GMT \n\nHenry Smith (Con) asks about support for sustainable aviation projects.\nSunak says the government is mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel. That will help to develop the industry in the UK.\n\n\n\n 12.04pm GMT \n\nJoanna Cherry (SNP) asks about a constituent who worked for a supermarket that operated a Post Office franchise. She was wrongly accused of dishonesty because of the Horizon system. Will people like her be included in the compensation scheme?\nSunak says the government will look into this case, and other similar ones, and get back to Cherry soon.\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm GMT\n\n\n 12.02pm GMT \n\nRishi Sunak says on Monday he met the families of the Nottingham stabbing attacks. And he welcomes the prospect of power sharing being restored at Stormont.\n\n\n\n 12.02pm GMT \nCommons speaker Lindsay Hoyle suggests approaching election has made MPs' behaviour worse at PMQs\n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, starts by saying MPs have been making too much noise at PMQs. He says bad behaviour has escalated. He urges MPs to show more restraint.\nUPDATE: Hoyle said:\n\nRecent exchanges have been lively to the point where it is becoming difficult for colleagues to hear what is being said clearly.\nThere has been an escalation in unhelpful exchanges across the floor of the House from sedentary positions, and the attempted use of props.\nSome of the language used in questions has also fallen short of the standard and good temper and moderation that should characterise the proceedings of this house.\nI know there is a general election approaching but I would urge members on both sides of the house to exercise greater self-restraint in their choice of words and in their general behaviour, both when they are asking a question and when they are not.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.43pm GMT\n\n\n 11.52am GMT \n\nHere is the list of MPs down to ask a question.\n\n\n\n 11.51am GMT \nSunak faces Starmer at PMQs\n\nRishi Sunak is about to take PMQs.\n\n\n\n 11.48am GMT \nSinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill says everyone in island of Ireland 'has been failed as direct result of partition'\n\nYesterday Sinn Féin said that a united Ireland was now “in touching distance”, as Rory Carroll reports.\n\n Related: Sinn Féin says united Ireland ‘within touching distance’ as Stormont deal agreed \n\nToday Michelle O’Neill, the first minister designate and Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, said everyone on the island of Ireland had been “failed” by partition.\nSpeaking after her meeting with Micheál Martin, the tánaiste (Irish deputy PM) in Belfast, O’Neill said:\n\nI think we have so much hope and opportunity in terms of the change, as we have been failed. Everyone across this island has been failed as a direct result of partition. Our people have been forced to live back-to-back instead of side-by-side.\nSo let’s look at the opportunities we have ahead of us and that’s why we call on the Irish government to create the forum in which we can have a healthy conversation about change, about education, about health across the island.\nWe are running two health services back-to-back, two education systems. We have so much opportunity that we need to harness and work together.\nI think the debate that we are going to have over the next decade is going to be one that hope and opportunity and benefits.\nBut it has to be inclusive, it has to be about us all and about Irish identity, British identity and the people who have made here their homes, all coming together.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.14pm GMT\n\n\n 11.40am GMT \n\nJamie Bryson, the loyalist activist and blogger who has been one of the most vocal critics in Northern Ireland of the DUP’s deal with the UK government, has challenged Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, to a public debate.\n\n\n💥 🇬🇧 A CHALLENGE TO SIR JEFFREY DONALDSON: As someone who stood on anti-Protocol platforms with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, I challenge him to face me or Jim Allister in a public debate either tonight or tomorrow night after the publication of the legal text.

He now calls us ‘naysayers’, well now is his chance to confound us and expose us once and for all.

Boris Johnson, the former PM, has posted this on X.\n\n\nFour years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country’s democratic power to make its own laws and rules. With those Brexit freedoms we have introduced improved standards for animal welfare, cut taxes on sanitary products, created greater flexibility for cutting…— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) January 31, 2024\n\n\n\nFour years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country’s democratic power to make its own laws and rules. With those Brexit freedoms we have introduced improved standards for animal welfare, cut taxes on sanitary products, created greater flexibility for cutting edge industries from financial services to bioscience, done many global free trade deals – and it was at least partly thanks to Brexit that this country had the fastest Covid vaccine rollout in Europe.\nWe must retain the appetite and the courage to diverge from the low-growth high-regulation European model. We must at all costs avoid a return to anything remotely like the disastrous “Chequers” formula whereby artificial concerns about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are used to keep the whole of the UK in alignment with EU rules.\n\nIn the past Johnson used to claim that the UK was able to have a speedy vaccine rollout entirely because of Brexit. Now he seems to have refined that a bit, saying it was “partly” due to Brexit. But he is still wrong, as numerous factcheck reports have stated, like this one.\nJohnson’s main point, about the need for the UK to retain the ability to diverge from EU rules, is a response to claims that the DUP deal will somehow restrict that. We will find out later to what extent, if at all, that is true.\n\nUpdated at 12.15pm GMT\n\n\n 11.19am GMT \nOnly 13% of Britons think Brexit has been a success, poll suggests\n\nAs discussed earlier (see 9.22am), so far there has been almost no protest from Tory Brexiters about the deal with the DUP – even though there are reports that it might limit the chance of the UK diverging from EU rules. That may change later when the full details of the deal are published.\nOr it may not. And if it doesn’t, perhaps that is because championing Brexit is not exactly a vote-winner at the moment. Ipsos has published polling this morning suggesting that only 13% of people view Brexit as a success and that, by a factor of more than 4 to 1, they are outnumbered by the 57% who view it as a failure.\nThe polling also suggests 70% of people think Brexit has been bad for the economy.\n\nUpdated at 11.21am GMT\n\n\n 11.04am GMT \n\nThere are three statements in the Commons today after PMQs at 12pm. The first, from Dame Andrea Leadsom, a health minister, will be about the plan to let pharmacies in England treat people for minor ailments.\n\n Related: Pharmacies in England to begin treating patients for seven common conditions \n\nChris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement about the deal with the DUP after that, starting at around 1.30pm. When he finishes Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, will make a business statement, presumably about plans to the Commons to pass legislation related to the DUP deal before the end of the week.\n\n\n\n 10.54am GMT \n\nCarolyn Harris (Lab) asked Cleverly if he agreed with Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, that any flights that did leave for Rwanda before the election were only likely to be “symbolic” because of the low number of people likely to be affected.\nCleverly said he did not agree. He would not describe flights like that, he said. He said the policy was meant to have a deterrent effect, and flights taking off would be a deterrent.\n\n\n\n 10.50am GMT \nCleverly tells MPs he cannot say how many of 33,000 asylum seekers liable for deportation to Rwanda might actually go\n\nDiana Johnson then asked Cleverly how many of those 33,085 asylum seekers were likely to be sent to Rwanda.\nCleverly refused to give a specific answer. He said it would depend on how many returns agreements were in place. The government was still negotiating those, he said.\nHe went on:\n\nSo it’s entirely feasible that a significant number within that cohort will be returned to their country of origin.\n\nQ: But what about the numbers to Rwanda? How many of those 33,000 will go there?\nCleverly said it would depend on how many went to other countries.\nJohnson repeated the question.\nCleverly said the Rwanda scheme was uncapped, so there was no upper limit. But he repeated the point that he could not give a number, because it would depend on any returns agreements with other countries.\nQ: Is it 100, 1,000, 10,000?\nCleverly said Johnson was asking the same question. He went on:\n\nYou’re asking for a figure that no one can provide, because it is contingent on other things happening … It is entirely dependent on what other work we do\n\nHe said the figure could be “quite low” or that it could be “nearly at that figure” (which seemed to be a reference to 10,000, but Cleverly was not specific).\n\nUpdated at 11.20am GMT\n\n\n 10.36am GMT \nCleverly tells MPs asylum application backlog not a backlog but a 'queue'\n\nBack at the home affairs committee Diana Johnson, the Labour chair, asks if the 33,085 asylum seekers mentioned earlier (see 10.17am) are in the asylum caseload backlog.\nJames Cleverly, the home secretary, says they are part of the 94,000 caseload. But he disputes the suggestion that this is a “backlog”. He says he would describe it instead as a queue. And he explains why.\n\nThere are a number of cases that we are working through. At any given time, someone who has arrived will be added the caseload. By your definition, if someone arrived yesterday, that would be a backlog. And I don’t agree with that as a definition. \n\n\nUpdated at 10.37am GMT\n\n\n 10.30am GMT \n\nMicheál Martin, the tánaiste (Irish deputy PM), is in Belfast today for talks with the political parties. After meeting Martin, Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, told journalists that he thought everybody was “pretty comfortable” with the deal secured by the DUP. He said:\n\nI think everybody is pretty comfortable with what the deal is. I don’t think anybody is concerned. I think everything that is going to happen is going to happen within the confines of what has already been agreed in regards to the Windsor framework.\nWhat we are really talking about is the application of the Windsor framework and certain things that may well change.\nI think Sinn Féin have known about this since last year and they are not jumping up and down, the European Commission is not jumping up and down, the Irish government is not jumping up and down.

And there is a “fairly strong possibility” that we do not know where large numbers of these people are. This number will only grow.\nQ: Where did these 33,085 people come from?\nHobbs says this figures does not just cover people arriving in small boats. It includes other people arriving illegally.\nQ: Re the ones not arriving in small boats, how do they get here?\nHobbs says some arrive at ferry points. Some arrive at airports, with fraudulent documents.

Businesses knew at the time of Brexit that in leaving the European single market there would be additional checks at the border because, by definition, we were no longer in that single market. There was no surprise about that.\nI can certainly remember as business secretary myself back in 2019 every day meeting with businesses, roundtables, to help them to prepare for us actually leaving the European Union and to understand the additional checks that would be required.\nSo businesses are used to the costs of doing business. I understand that today is a big news story because it is something that finally has come home to roost.\nBut the fact of the matter remains that businesses have huge opportunities with other parts of the world which are the direct benefit of us leaving the European Union.\n\n\n\nCan’t buy economically from Europe anymore?

During the Brexit negotiations, the DUP and the hardline Brexiters were aligned in their opposition to Theresa May’s plans, but it has been reported that the new deal might limit the extent to which the UK diverges from EU rules, and this is something liable to provoke the Tories.\nToday the i says Brexiters may claim Brexit has been betrayed.

The latest example has emerged today.\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour would not reinstate the cap on bankers’ bonuses that was introduced in 2014, as part of an EU initiative intended to limit the risk-taking in the financial sector blamed for the 2008 crash, and abolished by Liz Truss in her mini-budget.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Reeves said:\n\nThe cap on bankers’ bonuses was brought in in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances.\nBut that has gone now and we don’t have any intention of bringing that back.\nAnd as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.\n\nThe announcement won’t come as a huge surprise, and it will be welcome in the City, where analysts argued the cap never worked anyway because all it did was encourage banks to pay much higher basic salaries as an alternative.

Here is a roundup of the day’s biggest moments:\n\nAn emotional Sturgeon, who was on the edge of tears at various points of the day, said she felt the number of lives lost during the pandemic was “far too high”. Soon after, she said she was “sorry to each and every bereaved person, and each and every person who suffered in other ways. I did my best, my government did our best and people will judge that.”\nEarlier in the day, Sturgeon made a similar statement, saying that “for as long as I live I will carry the impact of [the] decisions” made during the pandemic.\nSturgeon admitted to deleting WhatsApp messages, saying she did so due to “security concerns”. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar later claimed that Sturgeon “lied” to a journalist when she told them that she had preserved WhatsApp messages which the inquiry would want to see.\nSturgeon said one of her main regrets about the pandemic is not locking down earlier in 2020. She said: “Of the many regrets I have, probably chief of those is that we didn’t lock down a week, two weeks, earlier than we did.”\nThroughout the day, she denied accusations of politicising the pandemic to bolster support for Scottish independence. Lead counsel Jamie Dawson KC said such a move would be a “considerable betrayal of the Scottish people”, to which Sturgeon agreed it would.\nEvidence that the Scottish government was concerned that Spain would block an independent Scotland from joining the EU over travel restrictions was presented to the inquiry. An email – copied to Sturgeon and a number of senior government figures – sent on 19 July from the email address of then deputy first minister John Swinney, but signed off by someone named Scott, said: “It won’t matter how much ministers might justify it on health grounds, the Spanish government will conclude it is entirely political; they won’t forget; there is a real possibility they will never approve EU membership for an independent Scotland as a result.”\nSturgeon said Boris Johnson was the “wrong prime minister” for the Covid crisis. She replied “yes” when asked if Boris Johnson was “the wrong prime minister” for the crisis.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.13pm GMT\n\n\n 4.49pm GMT \n\nToday’s hearing has come to an end. Lady Hallett, who chairs the inquiry, said it is unlikely Sturgeon will be called back again and noted that some members of the public gallery were distressed. \n\n\n\n 4.47pm GMT \n\nIn the final question for today, Sturgeon is asked whether the criminal trial for Alex Salmond on allegations of sexual assault, which went ahead in March 2020 and found Salmond not guilty on all counts, had any impact on the timing of when lockdown was imposed in Scotland.\n“No,” she replied.\n\n\n\n 4.38pm GMT \n\nSturgeon has admitted that there were “flaws and deficiencies” in care home guidance in early in the pandemic.\nShe said the situation in care homes was “one of the most important” parts of the pandemic response to scrutinise.\nIn the early months of the pandemic, more than 100 people were discharged from hospital to care homes after having previously tested positive for the virus and before returning a negative test.\nShe said: “I do not think we got everything right around care homes and I deeply regret that.\n“There were undoubtedly flaws and deficiencies in that guidance, but the advice at the time was isolation – keeping people as separate as possible – was the best way to protect people in care homes, and clearly that didn’t have the effect that we wanted it to have.”\n\n\n\n 4.36pm GMT \nSturgeon: 'I am deeply sorry to every bereaved person. I did my best'\n\nIn his final question to Sturgeon, Jamie Dawson KC asked if “the story of Covid in Scotland is the story of the hubris of Nicola Sturgeon”?\nA visibly emotional Sturgeon said: “No. I do not believe that to be the case.\n“I am in the fortunate position of not having lost anyone to Covid.\n“I wish with every fibre of my being that the decisions my government had been able to take could have reduced the number of people in Scotland who did lose someone to Covid.\n“I am deeply sorry to each and every bereaved person, and each and every person who suffered in other ways.\n“I did my best, my government did our best and people will judge that, but I know that every day I tried my best and those working with me tried their best to steer this country through the Covid pandemic in the best way we could.”\n\n\n\n 4.29pm GMT \nTeary Sturgeon says the number of lives lost during the pandemic was 'far too high'\n\nA teary Sturgeon said she feels the number of lives lost during the pandemic was “far too high”.\nChoking back tears, Sturgeon said: “I feel to my core that the number of lives lost to this pandemic were far too high. We were never going to be able to get through a pandemic with no loss of life.\n“I think it was far too high.\n“I think the other impacts were far too high, and, you know, every death is a tragedy that I regret, and that people in this room and outside across the country are living with the grief and trauma of, so we didn’t do as well as I wish we were able to.”\n\nUpdated at 4.31pm GMT\n\n\n 4.27pm GMT \nSturgeon: 'For as long as I live I will carry the impact of these decisions'\n\nSturgeon said that “for as long as I live I will carry the impact of these decisions” made during the pandemic.\nAn emotional Sturgeon told the Covid-19 Inquiry: “I remember sitting one night in probably February 2020 in Bute House with a set of reasonable worst-case scenario figures in front of me, and a figure for the potential number of deaths that might unfold, which thankfully didn’t unfold at that level, my instinct became something completely different.\n“In that moment, my only instinct and the instinct I brought to the management of the pandemic was: how do I lead a government that makes the best possible decisions in horrific circumstances to try to minimise the harm that this virus is going to do?\n“People will make their own judgments about me, about my government, about my decisions, but for as long as I live, I will carry the impact of these decisions, I will carry regret at the decisions and judgments I got wrong, but I will always know in my heart and in my soul that my instincts and my motivation was nothing other than trying to do the best in the face of this pandemic.”\n\n\n\n 4.26pm GMT \n\nSturgeon has rejected accusations that the pandemic response was run on her “instincts”.\nIn an exchange over a fanzone in Glasgow for the 2020 European Championships, which took place in 2021, Sturgeon was shown an email between then health secretary Humza Yousaf and national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch where they claimed her “instinct” was to cancel the event.\nResponding to the accusation from lead counsel to the inquiry Jamie Dawson KC, the former first minister said that could have been the case had the fanzone been cancelled.\n“I had an instinct, I tested it again with the experts, I asked for advice, I considered that advice and, on the basis of that advice, decided the opposite of what my instinct had started out telling me,” she said.\n\n\n\n 4.14pm GMT \n\nSturgeon said that Covid will “arguably” never go away after insisting she did not believe the pandemic would “soon be over” after the introduction of the vaccine.\nJamie Dawson KC asked Sturgeon: “Was it your view and that of the Scottish government that the pandemic would soon be over as a result of the arrival of the vaccine?”\nSturgeon said: “No. We’re no longer in a pandemic but people are dying from Covid every week as we speak.\n“Covid has not gone away. Arguably, Covid will never go away.”\nShe said she had been called the “voice of doom” around Covid.\n\n\n\n 4.12pm GMT \nSturgeon fights back tears again after saying she takes it 'very personally' when motives behind pandemic actions are questioned\n\nSturgeon fought back tears for second time today as she said she takes it “very personally” when her motives behind actions during the pandemic are questioned.\nShe said: “I take it very, very personally when people question the very motives because I know the motives were absolutely in good faith and for the best reasons.”\nJamie Dawson KC put it to Sturgeon she wanted to be “the person who had driven Covid out of Scotland”, which she rejected.\nThe former first minister said: “I hoped that the decisions my government would take would keep Covid at the lowest possible level, so that it took the lives of fewer people, minimised the disruption to people’s livelihoods and the education of children.\n“I accept that there will be genuine and serious scrutiny of the content of decisions that were taken, and some of those decisions I wish I had taken, my government, had taken differently, some – I think – were right.\n“My motives in this were only ever about trying to do the right thing to minimise the overall harm that the virus was doing.\n“The toll it took, in Scotland, as in other parts of the UK, was far too high, so I didn’t do that as successfully as I wish I was able to, but perhaps in some ways the measures we took had some impact.”\n\n\n\n 4.07pm GMT \n\nSturgeon was asked whether public health professor Devi Sridhar “frequently” ran what she intended to say in the press and in press interviews by her to ensure their positions were aligned.\nSturgeon denied this, saying: “The volume of Prof Sridhar’s output would suggest that if she ever did that, it was on a very small number of occasions.”\n\nUpdated at 4.22pm GMT\n\n\n 3.59pm GMT \n\nSturgeon said the Scottish government had a “maximum suppression” strategy, telling the inquiry the aim was to suppress the virus to the “lowest possible level”.\nShe said ministers used phraseology like “zero Covid” and elimination colloquially, but she said “emphatically” not eradication, which she said was a “very different concept”.\nShe added: “At no point was my belief that we would get Covid to a level where it was eliminated and went away.”\n\n\n\n 3.57pm GMT \n\nNicola Sturgeon said she should have “been the bigger person” and refrained from sending a tweet addressing a visit by prime minister Boris Johnson in July 2020.\nThe tweet, sent on 23 July 2020 read: “I welcome the PM to Scotland today.\n“One of the key arguments for independence is the ability of Scotland to take our own decisions, rather than having our future decided by politicians we didn’t vote for, taking us down a path we haven’t chosen. His presence highlights that.”\n\n\nI welcome the PM to Scotland today. One of the key arguments for independence is the ability of Scotland to take our own decisions, rather than having our future decided by politicians we didn’t vote for, taking us down a path we haven’t chosen. His presence highlights that.— Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) July 23, 2020\n\n\nSturgeon said: “On reflection, should I have risen to the bait and posted that tweet? Probably not.”\n\n\n\n 3.53pm GMT \nScottish government was concerned Spain would block future EU bid over Covid travel restrictions, inquiry hears\n\nAn email from the then deputy first minister John Swinney expressing concern that Spain would block an independent Scotland from joining the EU over travel restrictions has been presented to the inquiry.\nAn email – copied to the Sturgeon and a number of senior Government figures – sent on 19 July from the email address of Swinney, but signed off by someone named Scott, said he was “extremely concerned” about travel restrictions remaining on the country when there was a “point prevalence rate of 0.015”.\n“There is visible action from the Spanish authorities to do whatever it takes to suppress outbreaks (compare and contrast with outbreaks in England),” the email continued.\n“It won’t matter how much ministers might justify it on health grounds, the Spanish government will conclude it is entirely political; they won’t forget; there is a real possibility they will never approve EU membership for an independent Scotland as a result.”\nSturgeon has been accused of politicising the pandemic to bolster support for independence during the inquiry. Discussing the email, Sturgeon said: “These are decisions that were taken for public health reasons that were difficult decisions.”\n\n\nNEW: Email emerges showing concerns from the Scottish Govt that Spain could block a future application for EU membership for an independent scotland over Spanish travel corridors during covid.@SkyNews pic.twitter.com/YJPk4ida5z— Connor Gillies (@ConnorGillies) January 31, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.54pm GMT\n\n\n 3.35pm GMT \n\nPA has some reaction from some Scottish families who lost loved ones to Covid outside the inqiry hearing centre in Paddington.\nDuring lunch, members of the Scottish Covid Bereaved and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar, spoke to journalists outside the building where the inquiry is being held.\nHe said Sturgeon had delivered a “polished performance” at the inquiry but his clients were “deeply unsatisfied” with the explanations around the deletion of WhatsApps.\nAnwar said: “[Sturgeon’s] industrial deletion of WhatsApps, along with those of her inner circle, still begs the question of why.\n“Why were they deleted when she knew that there was a public inquiry on its way?”\nHe said the group is considering calling for a criminal investigation into the actions of the former first minister and others, but they would consider their next steps after Thursday’s evidence session concluded.\nMargaret Waterton, who lost her mother and husband to coronavirus, said Sturgeon was a “consummate politician” but the context of the decision-making at the heart of government remained unclear.\nWaterton said: “Ms Sturgeon said she had not had a day off for months during the pandemic.\n“I would ask Ms Sturgeon to consider walking in our shoes, because we have not had a day off since the deaths of our loved ones.”\nPeter McMahon, who lost his wife, Debbie, said both the UK and Scottish governments should “hang their heads in shame”.\nPamela Thomas lost her brother, James Cameron, during the pandemic.\nShe said too much time was being taken up on the issue of WhatsApp messages and said: “I don’t think they’re capable of actually telling the truth or being transparent.”\nShe added: “Crocodile tears aren’t washing with me.\n“If there is any tools available to my solicitors or the inquiry with regards to any criminal activity that took place, I would like them to use them all.”\n\nUpdated at 3.48pm GMT\n\n\n 3.30pm GMT \n\nSturgeon has denied politicising the pandemic to push for Scottish independence.\nSturgeon was asked whether she was using the pandemic to push for Scottish independence. Lead counsel Jamie Dawson KC asked if such a move would be a “considerable betrayal of the Scottish people”.\n“If I had at any point decided to politicise a global pandemic that was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods and educational opportunities, and had decided in the face of that to prioritise campaigning for independence, then, yes, it absolutely would have been as you described,” Sturgeon said.\n“Which is precisely why I didn’t do it – I wouldn’t have done it.”\n\nUpdated at 3.49pm GMT\n\n\n 3.15pm GMT \n\nSturgeon said none of the decisions she took were “influenced in any way” by political considerations or by trying to gain advantage in the goal of independence.\nShe said she had not thought “less” about politics and independence than she did during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nShe said: “I was motivated solely by trying to do the best we could to keep people as safe as possible.”\n\n\n\n 3.06pm GMT \nSturgeon says she regrets not locking down earlier in 2020\n\nSturgeon said one of her main regrets about the pandemic is not locking down earlier in 2020.\nShe said: “Of the many regrets I have, probably chief of those is that we didn’t lock down a week, two weeks, earlier than we did.”\nSturgeon went on to deny the decisions she took during the pandemic were done for political reasons, adding she had not “thought less” about politics and Scottish independence in her life than she did during the pandemic.\n“I was motivated solely by trying to do the best we could to keep people as safe as possible,” she added.\n“We did that to some extent, but not to, and perhaps we never could have done it to the extent I would have wished we could have done.\n“I carry the regret for the loss of life, the loss of opportunity, the loss of education of our young people, I carry that with me every single day.”\n\n\n\n 2.54pm GMT \n\nSturgeon said her introduction of coronavirus measures in Scotland before they were announced and introduced in England by the UK government was not designed to “annoy” Westminster.\n“At no point in my thinking was I trying to steal a march on anybody else or trying to get ahead of it,” she said.\n“I was simply trying to do my job to the best of my ability.”\nSturgeon added that if she were to seek to not “irritate” former prime minister Boris Johnson, she would have had to agree to do “whatever Boris Johnson wanted me to do”.\n\n\n\n 2.48pm GMT \n\nSturgeon said that the UK government may have communicated coronavirus measures “too slowly” rather than the Scottish government doing so too quickly.\nThe former first minister was accused throughout the pandemic of attempting to undermine the UK government by announcing decisions made on a four-nations basis before Boris Johnson was able to.\nSturgeon announced a ban on mass gatherings at 3.20pm on 12 March 2020 after a Cobra meeting, the inquiry heard.\nShe said her responsibility was “to the Scottish people, not Boris Johnson”.\n“I would put it that I communicated these things quickly, perhaps the UK Government were communicating them too slowly.”\nShe added: “Doing so with urgency at that point was required.”\n\nUpdated at 3.12pm GMT\n\n\n 2.36pm GMT \n\nSturgeon has denied a claim by Michael Gove that she broke confidentiality and “jumped the gun” when she announced a ban on mass gatherings in Scotland before other parts of the UK agreed to the move during the pandemic.\nThe then first minister announced on 12 March 2020 that the Scottish government would ban any gatherings of 500 people or more the following week, before that decision had been agreed at a Cobra meeting called later that day to discuss the crisis.\nMichael Gove, the then UK cabinet minister, has said this caused “discomfort” and “disquiet” in Whitehall, the inquiry has previously heard.\nBut responding today, Sturgeon said she would counter his allegations.\n“I think by this point none of us were jumping the gun and we were arguably going more slowly than we should have. The public was ahead of the government in terms of the action we should have taken.”\nShe added that her view on mass gatherings was that she felt it was important to take the action because there was still a of transmission, she was concerned about the pressure on emergency services having to police large events and also because she thought a “disjoint” was emerging in the messaging from government that the virus was serious.\n\n\n\n 2.25pm GMT \n\nSturgeon insists that work was undertaken to protect Scotland’s vulnerable population, which was disproportionately larger than in many other parts of the UK.\nShe replies “no” when Jamie Dawson KC, for the inquiry, puts it to her that in the early stages of the pandemic that the Scottish government was “asleep at the wheel”.\nThis came after Sturgeon insisted notes that had been taken by civil servant Derek Grieve which suggested there was a lack of preparedness and urgency within the Scottish government would have been taken seriously at the time.\nGrieve made the notes in March 2020 which showed Scottish government officials discussing “internal Scottish government communications”.\nSturgeon said: “I didn’t know about these views at the time, Derek Grieve is a civil servant that I have worked with in various capacities over my time in government. Again, you know, he is a civil servant of the utmost professionalism, so I would have taken seriously what he said.”\nBut, Sturgeon said, it had not been her experience at the time that there was a lack of preparedness.\n\nUpdated at 2.31pm GMT\n\n\n 2.19pm GMT \nSturgeon 'lied' about keeping WhatsApp messages – Anas Sarwar\n\nAnas Sarwar, leader of the Labour party in Scotland, has claimed that Nicola Sturgeon “lied” to a journalist when she told them that she had preserved WhatsApp messages which the inquiry would want to see.\nSarwar made the comments on a visit to Westminster, where he met journalists and have response to Sturgeon’s evidence thus far at the inquiry. There was, he said, “a huge sense of betrayal amongst the Scottish public”.\nHe added:\n\nNicola Sturgeon was someone that people, regardless of where they set on the political spectrum, they looked at during the Covid pandemic, particularly in contrast to Boris Johnson and thought: this was someone that was standing up and telling them the truth, being straight up with them, and trying to navigate the best way through the pandemic.\nI think the anger is worsened because with Boris Johnson, in her own words, he was a clown, he was an idiot, he didn’t know what he was doing. No one makes that accusation about Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP.\nAnd despite the fact that they knew what they were doing, to delete WhatsApp messages in such a wholesale way, to outright lie to a journalist and therefore to the public, I think is completely utterly unforgivable.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.30pm GMT\n\n\n 2.12pm GMT \n\nSturgeon is being asked about her non-attendance at the “Operation Nimbus” planning exercise in early 2020, which brought together senior figures from the UK government and other administrations.\nWith hindsight, her instinctive reaction might be that she should have been there, though she says that “not everybody can be at everything” in times such as the ones they were living in.\nThe meeting was aimed at drawing up a ‘battleplan’, the inquiry has previously heard, and set out a scenario in which the virus had claimed 840,000 lives in the UK.\n\nUpdated at 2.30pm GMT\n\n\n 2.00pm GMT \n\nSturgeon is being asked about the resignation of Dr Catherine Calderwood, who quit her role as chief medical officer to the Scottish government in April 2020 after facing intense criticism for breaking her own rules to twice visit her second home during the coronavirus outbreak.\nThis happened at a pivotal moment when the government and its experts were settling into a rhythm, Sturgeon says. Calderwood was a pivotal part of that and the then First Minister was “mindful” of the disruption that could be caused from losing her.]\nShe eventually realised, as more reports emerged, that Calderwood would be unable to stay. Calderwood had already reached that decision and it was to her credit that she had been clear with the First Minister that public messaging had to take precedence, Sturgeon says.\nThis stands in contrast to “some other episodes,” she says, in a potential reference, some might suspect, to the behaviour of those in government in London.\n\nUpdated at 2.02pm GMT\n\n\n 1.55pm GMT \n\nThe inquiry has returned and Sturgeon has said she had confidence in the advice she received from Scotland’s chief medical officers during the pandemic, despite none of the three coming from a respiratory disease or related background.\nSturgeon also moves again to speak up in defence of Dr Catherine Calderwood in response to a suggestion from counsel for the inquiry that Calderwood “did not seem to have much of a plan” when it came to preparing to implement a strategy for testing.\n\n\n\n 12.55pm GMT \n\nSturgeon rejects the suggestion that there was any “culture of secrecy” on the part of the Scottish government when it came to things like whether Scottish ministers covered up the first recorded Covid outbreak in Scotland, from a Nike conference in Edinburgh in February 2020.\nIn the case of Nike, the decision taken was informed by considerations of patient confidentiality, but she accepted that others may have taken a different view.\n“On Nike, I saw the potential – I don’t think this risk materialised – I saw the potential for the Nike conference to emerge later through a media disclosure to undermine confidence. In hindsight I would have gone the other way,” she added.\nThe inquiry is now breaking and will return at 1.45pm.\n\nUpdated at 1.00pm GMT\n\n\n 12.50pm GMT \n\nSturgeon was asked about another aspect of planning – the need for public messaging – and she was asked if there had been a recommendation that keeping the public informed at an earlier stage was as important as the later process of daily briefings.\nShe says she recalls in advance of the briefings more regularly being asked about it in interviews, so the public messaging was something that her government was aware of.\nJamie Dawson KC (for the inquiry) says there was evidence of some things not being communicated to the public, such as the identity of the first person to die from Covid in Scotland and concerns about a rugby fixture. None of them were communicated at the time with any detail. Was this on the advice of Dr Catherine Calderwood, who was the chief medical officer in Scotland for a period before she later resigned?\nSturgeon says there were difference considerations in relation to those different examples.\nShe had discussed them with Dr Calderwood, though looking back now she might take a different decision. That said, she did not believe her advice was unreasonable.\nA different physician might have had a different “risk appetite” and given different advice, while a “different politician” might have taken a different decision, she added.\nShe accepted the decisions made in that regard had the potential to undermine public messaging.\n\nUpdated at 1.01pm GMT\n\n\n 12.41pm GMT \n\nSturgeon is asked about previous evidence that the health system had lacked the kit and resources when it came to getting testing in place.\nIt didn’t reflect a lack of urgency in terms of planning, she insists, and there was an intense supply chain pressure.\nIt took time for larger testing labs to be got up and running, although it would always have been the case that things didn’t move as quickly as she would have liked.\n\nUpdated at 1.02pm GMT\n\n\n 12.32pm GMT \nSturgeon: 'At times I felt overwhelmed with what we were dealing with'\n\nSturgeon wipes away a tear, adding that in the early days of the pandemic her experience and view was that everyone was trying their best.\nShe insists that she did not see an opportunity of any sort in Covid, in answer to a question about whether she saw the pandemic as a political opportunity.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n“You have seen snippets of the human side of being a leader in those circumstances. At times I felt overwhelmed with what we were dealing with and perhaps more than anything I felt an overwhelming responsibility to do the best that I could.”\n“The idea that in those horrendous days, weeks I was thinking of a political opportunity … I find … well, it just wasn’t true,” she adds, appearing to be trying to hold off tears again.\n\nUpdated at 3.27pm GMT\n\n\n 12.29pm GMT \nSturgeon says Johnson was 'wrong prime minister' for Covid crisis\n\nSturgeon replies “yes” when asked if Boris Johnson was “the wrong prime minister” for the Covid-19 crisis.\nDid she consider herself to be the right first minister for the job?\nNo, that is not how she would see things, says Sturgeon, as her voice cracks when she goes on to say that there is a large part of her which would have wished that she was not in that role.\n\nUpdated at 12.30pm GMT\n\n\n 12.25pm GMT \n\nSturgeon was asked about a WhatsApp exchange in which Jason Leitch, a clinical director who advised on the response to the pandemic by the Scottish government, referred to the then first minister’s “‘keep it small’ shenanigans”.\n\n\nNicola Sturgeon was asked about comments on Whatsapp by an advisor to her govt that she favoured 'keep it small shenanigans\" when it came ot meetings\"You have to know Jason Leitch as well as I do to appreciate his sometimes turn of phrase,\" she responds pic.twitter.com/vSVqpcQciZ— Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) January 31, 2024\n\n\nLeitch was “crucial in a very positive way to our handling of the pandemic”, says Sturgeon.\nShe goes on to say that she suspects it was a reference to things that were sometimes said about her in government, which is that she “didn’t like a cast of unnecessary thousands” in meetings.\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm GMT\n\n\n 12.18pm GMT \n\nFrom the start of her evidence this morning, Nicola Sturgeon has appeared on edge, defensive, occasionally adopting that head girl-ish “I know best” tone that will be familiar to those who watched her briefings during the pandemic.\nBut there was a flare of genuine emotion at the end of the first morning session, when Dawson asked her about a story which appeared in the Express this morning which suggested that she and the former health secretary Jeane Freeman had purchased “burner phones” at the start of the pandemic.\nWhilst there are questions to ask about use of phones by ministers – earlier Sturgeon admitted she had only used a personal phone during her time as first minister – the insinuation of this particular report were dubious at best, and it was a surprise that Dawson raised it.\nSturgeon immediately explained that the purchases were made by her constituency staff as office landlines were diverted to mobiles once lockdown was imposed – many other MSPs would have done likewise she said.\nBut the trembling and twitching of her lips and the wetting of her eyes suggested she was struggling to keep her emotions in check. Was she frustrated that Dawson was raising such a trivial bit of mischief-making amidst otherwise serious questioning? Or simply responding to highly pressurised questioning?\n\nUpdated at 12.22pm GMT\n\n\n 12.16pm GMT \n\nThe inquiry is being shown notes taken by Liz Lloyd, Sturgeon’s former chief of staff, from a meeting in 2020 about steps taken to mitigate the financial impact of a so-called ‘circuit breaker’ lockdown.\nIn a previous hearing, Lloyd had been asked about her suggestion of “political tactics calling for things we can’t do to force the UK”.\nSturgeon says this was a period of 2020 which culminated in the second lockdown in England and enhanced measure in Scotland. It was the point when there was a “disjoint” between the ability of the Scottish government to take public health decisions and inability to borrow money to compensate businesses was coming to the fore.\n“This was a frustration that was expressed regularly by us,” she says, adding that the same frustration was felt by officials in Northern Ireland and Wales.\n“This was, to be blunt, the Scottish government seeking to ensure, if we had to apply tougher restrictions, Scottish workers would get their wages paid and Scottish businesses would be able to cover their costs in the same way as those in England would.”\nSturgeon says she rejects any suggestion that Kate Forbes, as finance secretary, was excluded from those meetings\nShe did not operate in on any issue in a way that sought to exclude people from decision making, she insists.\n“I tried to lead from the front. I tried to shoulder my fair share sometimes more than my fair share of the decision making given the severity,”\nBut she goes on to say: “I am sitting here thinking I don’t know why she wasn’t there that day, maybe she should have been in it and it was not a deliberate attempt to exclude her in any way.”\n\nUpdated at 12.32pm GMT\n\n\n 12.03pm GMT \n\nSturgeon has been asked by comments from Kate Forbes who said she “wasn’t invited” to any of the high-level Scottish government pandemic response meetings in 2020 despite being finance secretary at the time. Forbes also told the inquiry she was not even aware of the so-called “gold command” meetings which Sturgeon had convened.\nSturgeon says there would have been nothing to stop her from attending those meetings if she had wanted to and her office was copied in to the notice of the meetings and papers.\n\nUpdated at 12.15pm GMT\n\n\n 12.00pm GMT \nSturgeon 'strongly refutes' allegation she did not like light to be shone on how Scottish government made decisions\n\nJamie Dawson KC, for the inquiry, puts it to her that there has been a theme developing that the Scottish government which she led “did not like light to be shone” on the manner in which decisions were taken during the pandemic.\n“I would very strongly refute that,” Sturgeon replies, going on to tell Dawson that she had looked at all the cabinet papers from the whole period, which ran to thousands of pages.\nThat paperwork does not just simply recall the decisions that were reached, and the options, but also gives a “comprehensive record”, which included the “thought processes and rationales”.\n\nUpdated at 12.16pm GMT\n\n\n 11.56am GMT \n\nSturgeon is now being asked about something the UK Covid inquiry is struggling to understand in relation to how she took key decisions during the pandemic because her “gold command” meetings were not minuted.\nJamie Dawson KC, the inquiry’s Scottish counsel, has said previously it appeared that the Scottish government failed to record discussions during any of Sturgeon’s crucial “gold” meetings with a small handful of her advisers and senior ministers during 2020 and 2021.\nAsked about it today, Sturgeon essentially denies gold meeting were examples of her dictating policy without being minuted. Ultimately, cabinet made the decisions and set the policy, she insists.\nThere’s more here on the issue, as reported by my colleague Severin Carrell yesterday.\n\n Related: No minutes kept of Nicola Sturgeon’s ‘gold command’ meetings, Covid inquiry told \n\n\nUpdated at 12.17pm GMT\n\n\n 11.43am GMT \n\nSturgeon is shown a WhatsApp exchange in which Humza Yousaf, then health minister, was discussing the possibility of further lockdown related measures, but where there were questions about funding for business.\nThe inquiry has heard that Yousaf told cabinet that he had found money from his budget. In the WhatsApp messages, Yousaf said that “he had taken a bullet” at the meeting and that the then first minister “was not remotely happy its at this last stage.”\nDawson puts it to her that there was a culture where Sturgeon didn’t want to countenance things which she had not had advance sight of\n“There was no such culture in the government I led,” she says. Cabinet discussions were robust and earnest and she expected ministers to be able to come and argue for the decisions they wanted to take.\n\nUpdated at 11.46am GMT\n\n\n 11.35am GMT \n\nThe inquiry is back now again and has moved on to the decision-making process.\nBefore then, however, it’s worth reporting on this exchange we didn’t get to earlier in which Sturgeon said she “perhaps shouldn’t have” given an SNP address to Prof Devi Sridhar, who advised the Scottish government during the coronavirus outbreak\nThe inquiry saw messages between the pair where the then first minister gave Sridhar an SNP email address as well as a Scottish government email address.\nShe said: “On reflection perhaps I shouldn’t have done that.\n“But if I had been in any way trying to direct her to a private email address, I doubt if I would have put my government email address in there as well.”\n\nUpdated at 11.47am GMT\n\n\n 11.20am GMT \n\nSturgeon is being asked about her use of a personal phone – as other members of her government did – and whether she felt it was appropriate.\nIt was never suggested to me at any time during my period as first minister that it was not appropriate, she replies. She used a personal phone because she didn’t want to have multiple devices.\nJamie Dawson KC, for the inquiry, asks her about a report yesterday in the Scottish Daily Express that Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman, the Scottish government’s health secretary at the time, purchased cheap mobile phones and prepaid top-up cards during the early months of the Covid pandemic.\nSturgeon says that they were the phones her constituency office landline were diverted to in the homes of her constituency workers.\nShe had never “to the best of my knowledge seen heard or used any of the phones.”\nThe inquiry is now taking a break until 11.30 before it moves on to other areas of questioning by Dawson.\n\nUpdated at 11.49am GMT\n\n\n 11.11am GMT \n\nSturgeon has been shown exchanges from another WhatsApp group – which she was not a part of – in which a civil servant appeared to be encouraging others to delete records that could be recoverable under the freedom of information act\nShe says she “can’t answer” for Ken Thomson, the civil servant who made the remark, but she insists that her experience of him was that he was “assiduous” and took his duties and responsibilities seriously\n“I can only speak about my experience of him and I can give an answer based on my interpretation of it, which was that it was meant to be a light-hearted discussion,” she added.\n\n\nSturgeon wasn't in this Whatsapp group but she's being asked about a Scottish government civil servant who appeared to have been encouraging others to delete messages that could be recovered under FOICan't answer for him but she suggests it was \"light hearted\" pic.twitter.com/iAONXTNZLi— Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) January 31, 2024\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.49am GMT\n\n\n 11.03am GMT \n\nSturgeon is being pressed at length on the rationale for not storing WhatsApp messages. The position she keeps on returning to is that any decisions taken would have been discussed at cabinet level and recorded there.\n\n\nAt the Covid inquiry, Nicola Sturgeon is being asked about her deletion of whatsappsWould an exchange like this not have been one that would have informed a public understanding later?There was nothing in this exchange that would not have been recored in public record she says pic.twitter.com/ULOVEA0SBs— Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) January 31, 2024\n\n\nIn many cases, she insists, she would have been standing at a podium later in the day being questioned about the issues at hand.\n\nUpdated at 11.06am GMT\n\n\n 10.50am GMT \nSturgeon admits deleting WhatsApp messages\n\nSturgeon once again says she wants to be “very clear” that it was not her practice to have lengthy or detailed discussions through “these means” – a reference to WhatsApp.\n“It’s not my style,” she insists.\nWhat follows is an exchange between Sturgeon and Dawson over the manner in which messages were not retained on her phone. Dawson asks if she is making a distinction between deletion and not retaining messages, to which she tells him she was “very thorough” to keep to the advice she had been given about the retention of records.\n“But did you delete them?” asks Dawson\n“Yes,” comes the answer.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.39pm GMT\n\n\n 10.43am GMT \n\nThere was a frenetic pace in government at the time and the situation was changing several times a day, says Sturgeon. Three, four years on, it’s hard to appreciate that, she insists.\nDawson says however the fact that you are working at pace does not alter the need to ensure that decisions taken are stored on the corporate record.\nAs the conversation moves on, Sturgeon says that decisions taken were ones by their very nature were ones that could not be kept secret because they were ones the public was being asked to take.\nI didn’t get to it earlier, but it’s worth reporting that Sturgeon says she was being asked during the pandemic to take decisions which she and other politicians had never experienced before. Her voice seemed to break a little bit as she added that she “thinks about them every day.”\n\n\n\n 10.34am GMT \n\nDawson is pressing Sturgeon a bit further on how seriously she took the retention of records.\n“I knew I had operated in line with a policy I had operated in line with to ensure that conversations with others in government should not be kept in a phone that could be lost or destroyed,” she replies.\nSurgeon is also asked about an exchange she had with a Channel 4 journalist who had asked her if she would ensure that all emails and WhatsApps would be retained. You can view it here\n\n\n‘Can you guarantee to the bereaved families that you will disclose emails, WhatsApps, private emails if you’ve been using them. Whatever. That nothing will be off limits in this inquiry?’My question to @NicolaSturgeon August 2021 pic.twitter.com/OJDCBTESCe— Ciaran Jenkins (@C4Ciaran) October 29, 2023\n\n\n“I also knew that anything of any relevance or substance would be properly recorded in the Scottish government system,” she replies.\nShe says that she wants to underline that in her case “that communication” [WhatsApp] was extremely limited and would not apply to matters of substantive decision making.\nBut that wasn’t the question that Channel 4 had asked her, Dawson says.\nSturgeon apologises if her answer to the journalist was not “as clear” and wants to give the inquiry a “personal assurance” that the inquiry has “everything and everything” germane to her decision making during the crisis.\n\nUpdated at 11.07am GMT\n\n\n 10.26am GMT \n\nSturgeon says she can’t recall receiving an email which a Scottish government civil servant had sent out with a “do not destroy notification for members of the administration to remind them to retain records.\n“I do not. As far as I am aware I did not receive that,” Sturgeon tells Dawson, who goes on to suggest she would recall if such a communication was sent out.\n“I don’t think I would have required to see that to know that matters that were relevant, matters of substance, salient matters that would be relevant to the inquiry … should be retained.”\n\nUpdated at 10.47am GMT\n\n\n 10.21am GMT \nUse of WhatsApp 'too common' in Scottish government, Sturgeon says, but was not used for Covid decisions\n\nWhatsApp had become – maybe – too common a means of communication in government, says Sturgeon.\nBut she insists that government decisions were not being taken on the platform.\nOne of the reasons why she doesn’t believe it should be used for government decision making is that when politicians make public statements they should think very carefully about the scope for what they say being misinterpreted.\n“When you send things on WhatsApp you sometimes don’t think – including me – very carefully about how they can be interpreted,” she adds.\n\nUpdated at 10.33am GMT\n\n\n 10.18am GMT \n\nSpeaking about previous messages which the inquiry has seen, Sturgeon says she is not sure if she has seen any messages which contained material that the Scottish public would not otherwise have seen.\n“It might be for the Scottish public to judge,” interjects Jamie Dawson KC, for the inquiry.\n“Of course,” replies Sturgeon, who insists that it was an “open conversation” with the public throughout the pandemic.\n\nUpdated at 10.52am GMT\n\n\n 10.14am GMT \n\nThe WhatsApp issue has come up with haste and Sturgeon says that she was never a member of any Whatsapp groups and interacted through “informal messaging systems” with no more than a dozen people.\nPrincipally, she would have communicated with her former chief of staff Liz Lloyd and Humza Yousaf, her successor as Scotland’s First Minister and SNP leader but who was a member of her government at the time.\nCommunication of that nature was not used by me for anything other than routine exchanges and would have been “littered” with things like “there’s a note coming from me to you.”\nSturgeon says she operated on the basis that she would ensure that anything in communications of an important nature was otherwise recorded on the Scottish government system.\n\nUpdated at 10.35am GMT\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \n\nIs it still your position today that you and the Scottish government were open “open, transparent and accountable” not just in your actions but in your words?, asks Jamie Dawson KC\n“Yes, that is still my position. Openess and transparency with the Scottish public was very important to me from the outset,” says Sturgeon.\nThere will have been misjudgements and there will have been – on reflection – instances on which we could have done better, she adds.\n\n\n\n 10.05am GMT \n\n“You are Nicola Sturgeon,” the former SNP leader is asked after she takes her seat.\n“I am..”\nAnd with that the questioning is underway. Sturgeon confirms she has provided some additional material to the inquiry last week, in addition to her earlier statements.\nQuestion immediately focuses on communications during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n 9.58am GMT \nNicola Sturgeon gives evidence at UK Covid inquiry\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the former Scottish First Minister, is appearing before the Covid Inquiry in Edinburgh in what is the biggest day of the probe’s focus on that part of the UK.\nFor long the pre-eminent figure in Scottish politics, Sturgeon has experienced a dramatic fall from grace in the time since she was at the helm of her government’s response to the pandemic.\nBut while she was lauded by many at the time, she faces a range of awkward questions during an examination that is likely to see her draw on all of her experience as a lawyer and political representative.\nThose questions are likely to cover the following areas, and more:\n• The inquiry has previously heard that the former SNP leaded did not retain any of her WhatsApp messages. Why?\n• Sturgeon had pledged to hand over all of her communications from the pandemic. In what circumstances did they disappear or were deleted?\n• Guidance on the use of WhatsApp was issued by the Scottish government in 2021. Did she follow those rules and, if not, why not?\n• Sturgon has been accused of seeking to use the pandemic as a way of leveraging support for Scottish independence. Did she seek to deliberately engage in a politically self-serving row with the UK government over issues such as the Furlough Scheme?\nThis covering her answers to those questions – and anything else – on this liveblog, along with in-person reporting at the Inquiry from my colleagues Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks.\n\nUpdated at 10.36am GMT\n"

        "content": "Thousands of delicatessens and other specialist food shops have said new border rules that come in from Wednesday are likely to mean reduced choice of products for consumers. The Guild of Fine Food (GFF), which represents 12,000 businesses, has raised fears that European suppliers of specialist foods such as cheeses and meats will stop supplying the UK as a result of the additional red tape for imported goods. John Farrand, the managing director at the GFF, said: “I’m just worried that we are going to end up buying and selling only mass produced products. Are we going to see the end of smaller, more interesting products, which are ultimately better for the planet?” The government is introducing the biggest changes to the way the UK imports food and plant products from the EU since it left the single market in January 2021. The changes, known as the Border Target Operating Model, will require all imports of medium and high risk products, which include meat and dairy and the majority of plants, to be sent with export health certificates from Wednesday. On 30 April, these products will receive physical checks at the border before they can enter the UK. The new requirements have caused widespread concern that they could result in some smaller suppliers giving up on supplying the UK because of the extra costs. Farrand said while large supermarkets and large exporting businesses would have the financial base and resources to continue ensuring supply, smaller retailers and wholesalers would not. Andrea Rasca, the CEO and founder of Mercato Metropolitano, which runs a number of sites in London hosting dozens of independent food outlets, agreed that the new rules would deter EU suppliers, and urged the government to rethink. Rasca said: “For independent retailers, these new import rules could result in many specialty retailers or delis having empty shelves and at worst having to close down due to the limited supply of produce coming into the UK.” According to the government, the additional costs of the border checks and new certification requirements could add up to another £330m a year of extra costs for business. Nick Carlucci, the sales director at the Italian food importer Tenuta Marmorelle, said that he had heard of several suppliers in Italy opting against exporting to the UK because of the post-Brexit red tape. He said: “They have said it is not worth our while – the UK is not a big enough market for us. It’s a shame because the end user will ultimately lose these specialist products.” In a statement, the government said the new controls would help prevent the import of diseases and pests from overseas. The biosecurity minister, Lord Douglas-Miller, said they were “proportionate and pragmatic” and the government had worked closely with industry before finalising plans. He added: “The controls introduced today strike the right balance between trade and biosecurity.” MPs, however, have raised concerns about whether biosecurity will be sufficiently protected. In a letter to the environment minister, Steve Barclay, the environment, food and rural affairs committee said that it was particularly concerned with the plan to carry out border checks at the Sevington border post, which is 22 miles inland from the Port of Dover. The letter said that the plan presented a “potentially serious biosecurity risk” and also compromised compliance regarding lorries carrying goods. It added: “We understand that drivers will be under no obligation to go to Sevington, if asked to do so. As such, we have real and reasonable concerns about the geographic dislocation of the inland border facility from the point of entry.” A government spokesperson said: “This is not something we expect to see, having developed the model and its timelines for implementation through extensive consultation with industry stakeholders. “Our plan will help deliver the most advanced border in the world, progressively introducing an innovative approach to importing. “This includes using technology and data to make it simple for businesses to trade, while maintaining the flow and security of goods helping to keep the UK safe, while protecting our food supply-chains and our agricultural sector from disease outbreaks that would cause significant economic harm. “We have and will continue to work with industry, ports and airports to prepare for the changes being implemented.”"

        "content": "When the going gets tough … Rishi Sunak has never been the type of politician to duck a challenge. One of the phrases he repeats most often is that he chooses to do things “not because they are easy but because they are hard”. So on Tuesday morning the prime minister put himself through his hardest ordeal yet: ITV’s This Morning sofa. First, though, he was invited to try some fried chicken and tomato pasta that had been knocked up by the TV chef. Rish! grinned awkwardly and tried to look like a man at home with spontaneity. Rather, he just seemed like the random work experience teenager who had mistakenly walked on set. Or the producer’s son who had bunked off school for the day with a sore throat. The presenters Rylan Clark and Rochelle Humes quickly took control, escorting Sunak over to the sofa in the ad break and giving him a cushion to sit on. “Right,” said Rylan, flashing his brilliant white teeth. “Thank you for coming on. Let’s get on with the interview because I’ve got some enormously tough questions for you. First off, Northern Ireland. Have the DUP backed down or is the UK going to stay aligned with EU law? And is the £3bn basically just a bribe?” Rish! looked dazzled. Panic-struck, even. Rylan broke out into a laugh and patted the prime minister affectionately on the knee. “Just kidding!” What he really wanted to know was how Sunak’s fast had gone. Not too bad, the prime minister said, though he wasn’t as disciplined as he would like to be. So he did have the odd nut? “Oh, yes,” laughed Rish!. The cabinet was full of them. Boom, boom. Then we moved on to vaping. It was very important to stop kids vaping. But he didn’t want to put adults off trying to stop smoking. There was a balance to be struck. Rylan and Rochelle nodded attentively. This was cutting-edge TV.    Related: Pharmacist at former Sunak family chemist wary of PM’s health plans   It could be hard to get an appointment to see a GP, Rylan observed. “That’s why we’ve made it easier to see a pharmacist,” said Sunak. Rather missing the point. “My mother was a pharmacist.” Really? Who knew? “From tomorrow you can see a pharmacist for seven common conditions.” Like the sort of things people already go to see a pharmacist for because they know they won’t be able to see a doctor. Rochelle chipped in. Most people didn’t want to go to see a pharmacist if they had cancer or needed a knee replacement. A waste of everyone’s time. “My dad was a GP,” said Sunak. As if that somehow made him a medical expert. Then he backtracked. He wasn’t saying people had to see a pharmacist. Just that they could if they wanted to. There was always their GP if they could get an appointment. We were back where we started. “We want to improve telephony,” Rish! insisted. The problem wasn’t that there weren’t enough GPs. It was that most surgeries didn’t have the right phone lines. What was needed was more systems that allowed artificial intelligence to inform patients they were unable to see a doctor that day. Press 1 to be told there is a two-month delay for an ultrasound, press 2 to be told that a locum will ring you sometime in the next week. And press 3 if you are happy to die while waiting. Rylan wondered why the government didn’t just offer doctors more cash. Wouldn’t that be the best way of bringing down waiting lists? Absolutely not, said Sunak. He’d already been quite generous enough. Most doctors were already far too rich. Didn’t know they were born. Now was the time to think of the really destitute. The government ministers who were on the breadline earning £118,000. Would no one take pity on them? Just then, ITV ran a banner across the screen. “Call 0845 600 600 and get through to George Freeman’s JustGiving page. A donation of just £200 could buy George dinner for two at his favourite Mayfair restaurant. Remember, an MP isn’t just for Christmas”. Rylan and Rochelle collapsed into tears. Broken people. After a lengthy pause to gather themselves, Rylan brought up the Nottingham killings. The families of the victims were calling for a public inquiry. Rish! shook his head. It had all been a terrible tragedy but he wasn’t at all sure who could authorise such action. When he found out who was running the country, he’d make sure to ask him. Same with knife crime. This was also terrible. But he had no idea who the government had been that had cut youth services.   Related: Sunak to cut taxes twice more before election, says Tory chair   That just left the election. People would be feeling so much richer after his tax cuts. Providing they didn’t look at their council tax or hadn’t been dragged into new tax bands. Or had made the mistake of buying any food. Or had read the latest IMF report suggesting the UK economy was in poor shape. “There’s a brighter future round the corner,” Sunak said. There was. And it’s that this interview was coming to an end. There was just time for a George Freeman update. Thanks to the generosity of ITV viewers, more than £5m had been raised. Enough to keep George alive for another month. It hadn’t just been a few hundred thousand people who had forgotten to switch over who had watched this groundbreaking interview. It was also the Evil Plotters. Trying to work out when might be the best time to make their move. “Brilliant news,” said Kemi Badenoch. “Our top-secret group is still a complete secret. Nobody knows anything about us. Nor must they ever find out. For no one must ever think that I am anything but completely loyal to Rish!” “My thoughts entirely,” said the posh, oleaginous Alex Burghart. “Because I went on TV last week to tell the great unwashed how well the government was doing. I would hate anyone to think I was two-faced.” “Luckily no one knows who we are,” chipped in Julia Lopez and Rachel Maclean. “So Rishi will still think we are completely trustworthy. Gosh! Imagine what he might say if he knew what we were really like.” “Hello everyone.” It was the Govester. “Er … It looks like there’s been a leak. I’m afraid I’m going to have to act like I don’t know anyone. Sorry to be a treach. But then you can’t say you weren’t warned. I’ve stabbed everyone else in then back, so why should you lot be an exception.” “Am I in this group?” asked Dougie Smith. “Probably,” said Kemi. “You’re in almost every other one. Though I think you are in with Suella and ‘The Really Evil Plotters’.” “That’s me,” squeaked Will Dry. “It’s your bedtime,” drawled Nadine Dorries. “It’s all coming to pass as I predicted in my book. The Plot to get Kemi into No 10 via coming out of the EU to getting back in, via Cameron … Boris, I really love you …” “Pissed again,” said Kemi. “Just give it a rest. You know what? I’m not even sure I want to be leader of a party with you halfwits in it.”"

        "content": "Sinn Féin has said a united Ireland is “within touching distance” as the party prepares to claim the post of Northern Ireland first minister for the first time.\nMary Lou McDonald said on Tuesday that the expected restoration of power sharing in the wake of a deal between the Democratic Unionist party and the UK government came amid a “historical turning of the wheel” that would unite the island.\n“In historic terms, it is within touching distance and I think that is a very exciting thing and I hope people will find that a very welcoming conversation,” the Sinn Féin leader said.\nAccording to a speedy political choreography that is supposed to unfold at Westminster on Wednesday and Thursday, her deputy, Michelle O’Neill, could become first minister of the Stormont executive by the weekend.\n“That will be a moment of very great significance, not simply because we haven’t had government for so long but because it will be the first time that we will have a Sinn Féin first minister, a nationalist first minister,” McDonald said.\nO’Neill became the region’s putative first minister when Sinn Féin overtook the DUP as the biggest party in the 2022 assembly election. But a DUP boycott to protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements mothballed Stormont.\nThe DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, signalled an end to two years of deadlock early on Tuesday when a tumultuous meeting of the party’s 130-member executive endorsed a deal to revive power sharing.\nThe deal will remove restrictions on the movement of goods within the UK, Donaldson said. “That was our core key objective and I believe what we have secured represents real change and everybody will be able to see it for themselves.”\nHe has promised “zero checks, zero customs paperwork on goods moving within the United Kingdom”. The DUP endorsement is conditional on two statutory instruments at Westminster to give legislative effect to Downing Street commitments on trade and sovereignty.\nChris Heaton-Harris, the UK’s Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal featured a “vast array of decent improvements” and would be published on Wednesday. The legislation is expected to be fast-tracked through Westminster on Thursday. A spokesperson for Rishi Sunak said the deal was a “strong basis” to restore Stormont.\nDowning Street said the prime minister had a “good call” with Leo Varadkar. Ireland’s taoiseach has welcomed the deal but he cautioned that Dublin and Brussels needed to see the text to be confident there were no “negative consequences” for the Windsor framework or for the Good Friday agreement. The European Commission echoed the guarded welcome. “We will examine those texts when the time comes,” said a spokesperson.\nConservative MPs have expressed concern the deal could limit Great Britain’s ability to diverge from EU rules in the future to limit the impact of an Irish Sea border on internal trade with Northern Ireland. Downing Street said the deal would not prevent the UK from exploiting post-Brexit freedoms.\nIf there are no glitches, Stormont could be recalled as early as Friday to elect an assembly speaker and appoint an executive drawn from Sinn Féin, the DUP, the Alliance party and the Ulster Unionist party. The DUP will be entitled to the deputy first minister post, which has equal power to first minister but less prestige and symbolic weight.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nO’Neill said Stormont faced an urgent workload, including a fiscal crisis, strikes and crumbling healthcare. “We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, a slog ahead of us, but collectively we can do better for the people we serve. Collectively, we can fight back against this Tory austerity agenda, collectively we can stand up and fight hard for public services.”\nThe government has offered a £3.3bn financial package that is conditional on Stormont’s restoration. It includes funding for pay rises that could avert public sector strikes, though not a strike by transport workers that is to go ahead on Thursday.\nThe Alliance leader, Naomi Long, said the breakthrough deal brought “bittersweet emotions” because of the time Stormont had been absent.\nMatthew O’Toole, of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said it was “not the time for champagne corks to pop or balloons to be released in celebration” given the failures of the past two years.\nJim Allister, the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice, accused the DUP of a “tawdry climbdown” and said its boycott should continue."

        "content": "\n 5.46pm GMT \nAfternoon summary\n\n\nMichelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, is poised to become the first nationalist first minister at Stormont after the DUP said it would be lifting its boycott of power sharing. The DUP agreed to resume participation in the power sharing executive, which has been suspended for almost two years, on the basis of a deal agreed with the UK government to revise some of the post-Brexit trading rules that disadvantaged Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, played down the significance of O’Neill becoming first minister (see 3.51pm), but it is bound to be seen as a historic moment for Northern Ireland, where the unionists have been the dominant political community for most of the last century and where Sinn Féin was for many years marginalised because of its links with the IRA. Donaldson also claimed the deal was a victory for his party, because it confounded critics who claimed the DUP would never be able to change the legal terms of the Windsor framework. (See 4.49pm.) Details of the deal have not yet been published, and it is possible that their release tomorrow will lead to claims that Donaldson has over-sold what has been achieved. But with Sinn Féin and other parties welcoming the prospect of Stormont being revised, Dublin and Brussels apparently relaxed about the Windsor framework being altered, and no significant figures from the DUP speaking out against the deal, the Northern Ireland executive does seem on course to return within days.\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has issued a strong warning to Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes in his budget in March, stressing the need to boost key areas of public spending instead.\n\n\nThe UK Covid inquiry is struggling to understand how Nicola Sturgeon took key decisions during the pandemic because her “gold command” meetings were not minuted, the inquiry has heard.\n\n\nKeir Starmer’s office has begun polling British Muslim voters amid growing concern in senior Labour ranks about the damage done to their core vote by the row over the party’s position on the Middle East.\n\n\nCouncils in England are to be encouraged to sell publicly owned buildings and other assets worth up to £23bn under plans being explored by ministers to plug budget shortfalls amid the crisis in local government.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.47pm GMT\n\n\n 4.49pm GMT \nDonaldson says DUP has confounded critics who said it would never be able to achieve 'legal change' to Windsor framework\n\nHere are some more quotes from what Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said in his news conference at Stormont this afternoon.\n\nDonaldson, the DUP leader, said he had confounded critics who claimed his party would never be able to achieve legal changes to the Windsor framework. He said:\n\n\nThose who said there will be no legal change, who were predicting things would fall short, I simply asked people to wait and see the outcome. Wait and see the evidence and judge for yourself what this deal does, what it delivers, the change that it secures. I believe we are now beginning to see on day one that delivery coming through.\n\n\nHe said the DUP had negotiated the removal of extra checks on goods coming from Britain to Northern Ireland and due to stay there. He said:\n\n\nOn checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK, there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK, there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nHe said “supplementary” customs declarations would no longer be needed. He said:\n\n\nOn customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone and therefore we believe this represents a significant change.\n\n\nAnd he said the “green lane”, a Windsor framework arrangement for goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland and not destined for Ireland, would go. He said:\n\n\nAs far as we are concerned, the green lane will go and be replaced by the UK internal market system that reflects the reality that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, that goods flowing within the United Kingdom, flow freely.\nThat was our core key objective and I believe what we have secured represents real change and everybody will be able to see it for themselves.\n\nJames Crisp from the Telegraph reported on this last week – although he suggested the the rebranding was partly cosmetic.\n\n\nSo offer to DUP, as I understand it, is as follows.Patriotic rebrand of WF Green Lane to “UK Internal Market Lane”.All new laws to be screened to ensure they don’t have “significant adverse impact” on GB-NI trade.Warm words promising to negotiate more cuts with EU7/— James Crisp (@JamesCrisp6) January 26, 2024\n\n\n\nSo offer to DUP, as I understand it, is as follows.\nPatriotic rebrand of WF Green Lane to “UK Internal Market Lane”.\nAll new laws to be screened to ensure they don’t have “significant adverse impact” on GB-NI trade.\nWarm words promising to negotiate more cuts with EU\n\n\nDonaldson suggested that the Northern Ireland executive could reform very soon, although he said this was dependent on the UK government bringing forward legislation.\n\n\nHe played down the significance of Northern Ireland having a Sinn Féin first minister. Asked how significant it was that people would be serving under a Sinn Féin FM, he replied:\n\n\nThe offices is a joint office [because first minister and deputy FM carry equal weight in decision making]. The DUP has in the past shared that joint office. We are democrats.\nThe electoral results are there. I wish it had been different, of course. Like any political party you want to win the elections. I hope that from a unionist point of view we are learning the lessons that divisions in unionism, especially at election time, do not win unionist seats.\n\nHe also said he hoped unionism would “get its act together” in future so there were more unionist MLAs at Stormont.\n\nUpdated at 5.07pm GMT\n\n\n 4.22pm GMT \n\nDowning Street has said that the draft update to the Windsor framework published today (see 4.03pm) is not the same as the deal to restore power sharing at Stormont.\nAsked about the document published today, a No 10 spokesperson told journalists at the afternoon lobby briefing:\n\nThat is not part of this agreement. This is separate – this is an update on some separate work we have been working on with the European Commission.\nThis is a joint legal solution that will benefit Northern Ireland traders. But to be clear, this is a separate stream of work from the agreement that was discussed last night and that will be published tomorrow.\n\nAsked to explain what the revisions to the framework mean, the spokesperson said:\n\nThis is a joint legal solution agreed with the European Commission. It will ensure Northern Ireland traders can benefit from the UK’s independent free trade policy when importing agri-food goods.\nThere are lot of technical details. It will mean that over 30,000 tonnes of lamb, beef and poultry from key FTA (free trade agreement) partners and other countries around the world will now be covered by the UK and not the EU’s tariff quota regime every year.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.23pm GMT\n\n\n 4.05pm GMT \n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, posted this comment on X on Raoul Ruparel’s thread. (See 4.03pm.)\n\n\nThis demonstrates that the naysayers are wrong. There will be legal changes. I asked people to wait and study the outcome rather than follow misinformed speculation.

It says that this is coming tomorrow.\nBut it has published a draft decision from the withdrawal agreement joint committee, the UK-EU committee that oversees implementation of the agreement taking the UK out of the EU. And this sets out changes to the agreement that have been negotiated.\nAnd here is commentary on the deal from Raoul Ruparel, who was immersed in Northern Ireland protocol issues when he worked in No 10 as Theresa May’s adviser on the EU. He has posted these on X.\n\n\n🚨Something unexpected on NI🚨...new Joint Committee legal decision expanding 'not at risk' category to cover rest of world imports into NI.

That is what Mary Lou McDonald, the party’s president (and leader of the opposition in the Irish parliament) and Michelle O’Neill, the party’s vice-president and its leader in Northern Ireland, where she is first minister designate, said at a news conference at Stormont. Here are the top lines.\n\nMcDonald said that Sinn Féin was “incredibly postive” about the prospects for Northern Ireland as a result of the deal. And O’Neill said, although there was a lot of work to do, with Stormont sitting again, this could happen. She said:\n\n\nI do think it is a day of optimism and some hope for the wider public.\nOur public services are stretched to the limit, our public-sector workers have been forced out on to the picket lines.\nI want to be in position because I want to make a difference to people’s lives, I want to stand up and fight back against this Tory austerity agenda that has hurt our public services so much over the last 13 years.\nWe have a lot of hard work ahead of us, a slog ahead of us, but collectively we can do better for the people we serve.\n\n\nMcDonald said that the fact that a Sinn Féin leader was about to become first minister was a sign of “the extent of change” that has taken place across Ireland. She said:\n\n\n[This] will be a moment of very great significance; not simply because we haven’t had government for so long but because it will be the first time that we will have a Sinn Féin first minister, a nationalist first minister.\nSo, a mark of the extent of change that has occurred in the north and indeed right across Ireland.\n\n\nO’Neill and McDonald said taking on “Tory austerity” would be a priority for the new executive.\n\n\nMcDonald said that she was satisfied that the new deal would not undermine the UK’s existing agreement with Brussels on the Windsor framework. She said:\n\n\nWe’ve obviously been in close contact with both governments, and indeed with Brussels. We are satisfied that no part of the Good Friday agreement has been undermined or damaged. And we also know that Brussels, Dublin, all parties, are satisfied that what has been agreed stays between the hedges of the needs of Brussels and the European market, and also the concerns that the DUP expressed.\n\n\nShe said her understanding was that the actual deal was concluded some time ago.

He said:\n\n\nI will tomorrow publish the details of the proposals we have made to secure Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market and to strengthen the union. I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return.\n\n\nHe paid tribute to the DUP and its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, saying that Donaldson’s main motive was to secure Northern Ireland’s place in the union. He said:\n\n\nI welcome the very significant step from Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the step he took last night. I’m very grateful to Sir Jeffrey and his colleagues for the leadership that he and they have displayed, and the constructive nature of our dialogue over the past few months.\nThroughout our discussions, it has never been in doubt that Sir Jeffrey’s prime concern was to secure and reinforce Northern Ireland’s place in the union.\nI would also like to thank the other political parties in Northern Ireland for the patience they have shown during this time.\n\n\nHe said the financial package for Northern Ireland worth more than £3bn was still on the table for an incoming executive to spend.\n\n\nHe refused to confirm Donaldson’s claim that, under the deal, there would be no checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland and remaining there. (See 9.16am.) Asked about this, he said journalists would have to wait until the deal was published. But he had achieved “a vast array of decent improvements to make sure our internal market works properly, as it should do”, he said.\n\n\nHe said the main parties in Northern Ireland entitled to form a power-sharing executive would be meeting today to discuss the deal.\n\n\nHe claimed the deal with the DUP involved “significant changes”, but he refused to say what they were. Asked what had changed, he said:\n\n\nThere are some significant changes but you will have to wait until the all-party talks are finalised. When I publish the deal in parliament, everyone will see what it is.\n\n\nHe said the deal did not affect “in any shape or form” Britain’s ability to diverge from UK rules as a result of Brexit.\n\n\nHe said he did not think the Windsor framework would have to be renegotiated as a result of this deal.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.10pm GMT\n\n\n 12.08pm GMT \nDeal with DUP won't require Windsor framework to be renegotiated with EU, says Heaton-Harris\n\nQ: Was the EU consulted on this?\nHeaton-Harris said he spoke to the EU regularly about all sorts of things.\nQ: Will the Windsor framework have to be renegotiated?\n“I don’t believe so,” Heaton-Harris said.\n\nUpdated at 12.23pm GMT\n\n\n 12.05pm GMT \n\nHeaton-Harris said, under the deal, new money for Northern Ireland would be available to the incoming executive.

There are independent inquiries into different services. When the findings of those inquiries come back, the government will decide if a further inquiry is needed.\nUPDATE: Sunak said:\n\nWhat [the relatives] expressed to me are a bunch of questions about what’s happened that they have.\nHow did the NHS operate? Was mental health properly checked? How was the police investigation conducted? How was the Crown Prosecution Service operating and interacting with them? I think those are all perfectly reasonable questions.\nWhat I said to them is that we will get the answers. That’s what they deserve. That’s what I’ve committed to.\nWe’ve set up investigations, independent ones, into all those areas I mentioned. The NHS, the Crown Prosecution Service, the police forces.\nSo, they’re all going to be looked at independently so we can get those answers. That’s going to happen promptly and thoroughly and effectively, as quickly as possible.\nOnce we hear back from that, then we can sit down with them and decide if there are more questions that need answering.

Was that your first food since the fast?\nNo, says Sunak. He had already had a pastry.\nHe says he tries to have a day of fasting on Mondays – not totally nothing, but “largely nothing”.\nHe loves sugary things, he says. He does not exercise as much as he used to. So he does this.\nQ: You want to stop disposable vapes being sold? When will that happen?\nSunak says parents and teachers worry about the rise in children vaping. No one knows the long-term health impacts. The government will ban disposable vapes, stop vapes being sold in flavours aimed at children, and restrict how they are displayed.\nQ: But will this stop adults getting vapes?\nSunak says there is a balance. He thinks the government has got it right. Disposable vapes are overwhelmingly the ones children use. But the government supports adults vaping as an alternative to smoking.\nQ: It is hard to get an appointment with a GP.\nSunak says, from tomorrow, people will be able to go to pharmacists for appointments relating to conditions like sore throats.\nQ: But people need GP appointments. And it is so frustrating not being able to get an appointment.\nSunak says he wants people to have a choice.\nPharmacists are “incredibly highly trained”, he says. That is why they will be able to offer treatment for seven common ailments.\nOn GPs, he says the government is ensuring GP surgeries have the latest telephone systems. That will make a difference to how they handle calls.\nQ: Why don’t we pay junior doctors more?\nSunak says all health staff have been offered more money, based on independent recommendations.\nHe says it was “disappointing” some of these offers were rejected.\nBut there is “no magic money tree”, he says.\n\nUpdated at 12.02pm GMT\n\n\n 11.29am GMT \nWhat happens next to Rwanda bill?\n\nA reader asks:\n\nThis seems to be one of those times when a piece of parliamentary news falls off the bottom of the radar with no trace. After your evening summary there’s been no news of the 2nd reading of the Rwanda bill. I finally found the Hansard report which ends “that the bill be committed to a committee of the full house”. So what does this mean in practice? They can add amendments? Do these then have to be voted on by whole House of Ls? Is there a set end date? Must the Commons wait? Cd gov just decide to send a plain load of refugees in the meantime to Rwanda?\n\nThe House of Lords voted to give the second reading of the Rwanda bill at 9.30am.\nThe Lib Dems forced a vote on an amendment to block the bill, but it was easily defeated. The Lords never normally votes on bills at second reading, and it only votes down bills at this point very rarely (just three times this century). Labour is opposed to the bill, but it did not vote with the Lib Dems because it accepts the convention that the Lords is there to revise bills passed by the Commons, not to reject them, as its spokesperson explained in the debate yesterday.\nHere is the division list naming the handful of Labour and crossbench peers who voted with the Lib Dems for the blocking amendment.\nThe bill will now go to a committee of the whole house, which means that all peers can participate in the line-by-line debate on the bill. They will debate amendments, and some will almost certainly be passed. There will then be a vote at third reading. At that point peers could again, in theory, throw out the whole bill. But they won’t’; they’ll send it back to the Commons amended.\nThere will be debates in February but the report stage, when most votes take place, is not due to start until March. The third reading debate is provisionally scheduled for 12 March.\nThe government cannot sent refugees to Rwanda until the bill becomes law because the supreme court has ruled that unlawful.\n\nUpdated at 12.03pm GMT\n\n\n 11.25am GMT \n\nRishi Sunak is in the ITV’s This Morning studio.

PA says:\n\nApplicants will be required to demonstrate a connection to the UK for at least 10 years and their local area for at least two years in an “overhaul” of the system.\nThose with unspent criminal convictions or certain civil sanctions for antisocial behaviour could be banned from social housing for up to five years.\nPeople who “repeatedly make their neighbours’ lives hell” through antisocial behaviour also face being evicted under a “three strikes and you’re out” policy.\nTerrorists with certain convictions could also be blocked from living in social homes.\nNew social tenants on high incomes would also no longer qualify. The salary threshold is yet to be determined and existing tenants would not be affected.\nA consultation will run until 26 March and can be accessed through an online survey.\nThe government has suggested some of the measures may be implemented by secondary legislation, which would mean they do not require a vote in parliament.\n\nAs this briefing from the House of Commons library says, most local authorities in England already have requirements saying people applying for council or housing association homes must have lived in the area for a certain amount of time.\nLast week, after the Guardian reported that this announcement was imminent, 16 leaders from the social housing sector signed an open letter saying that this move could increase homelessness and that what was really needed was just more social housing. They said:\n\nSocial housing is designed to support those in the greatest need. Government data shows that 90% of new social housing lettings go to UK nationals, with long waiting lists in all areas. Imposing extended qualification periods before people can even get on the housing register is likely to force more people into homelessness. If the government’s main concern is to increase the availability of social lettings, it could achieve this far more effectively by building more social housing.\n\nIn an interview this morning Lee Rowley, the housing minister, was asked if refugees could be barred from social housing under the new plans. He said there was a recognition there “will be certain scenarios where there are exemptions”, giving the example of the Afghan resettlement schemes.\nPressed on whether that could change, he said: “Well, if the state has an obligation to house people that will continue, that’s part of a different set of rules to make sure that people are not homeless.”\n\nUpdated at 10.58am GMT\n\n\n 10.35am GMT \n\nOn Sky News this morning Sam Coates had a good explanation of why the DUP decision to accept the deal on offer from the UK government may not be the end of the story.\n\n\nNot all smiles and rainbows after DUP deal to restore devolution at #StormontOur Deputy Political Editor @SamCoatesSky has the latest#KayBurley FC pic.twitter.com/0kGHvJEtvX— Kay Burley (@KayBurley) January 30, 2024\n\n\nOn X Farrukh has written up his key quote.\n\nSam Coates, “The British government are trying something quite hard:\n“They’re trying to tell the DUP that something has changed about the way Britain relates to NI and they’re trying to get rid of checks.\n“They’re trying to tell the EU that nothing has changed”\n“And they’re trying to tell the Brexiters that everything is fine and this doesn’t reflect the UK’s ability to embrace Brexit freedoms”\n“Not all three things can be true.

DUP MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) have been boycotting power sharing at Stormont for almost two years now.

The DUP supported Brexit, but they were angry about the protocol, and the framework, imposing post-Brexit trading rules affecting goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. As a result of their two-year Stormont boycott, they have secured some changes to the framework and, as is standard in London negotiations with the Stormont parties, a large wodge of cash for Northern Ireland.\nRory Carroll has the details here.\n\n Related: Stormont power-sharing in sight as Northern Ireland DUP accepts post-Brexit deal \n\nThe UK government has not yet published details of what changes it will make to the framework, but this is how Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, explained what’s on offer.\n\n[The new deal] will remove checks for goods moving within the UK and remaining in Northern Ireland and will end Northern Ireland automatically following future EU laws.\nThere will be legislation to provide new legal and practical protections for the Acts of Union and which guarantees unfettered access for Northern Ireland businesses to the rest of the United Kingdom.\nIn the coming days, in addition to the publication of the details of the new package of proposals, the UK Government will be required to deliver on the legislative commitments they have made to us.\n\nDonaldson also said there was cross-party support for the deal, meaning that the election of a Labour government would not lead to it being reversed.

        "content": "MPs have condemned plans by the former Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen to host an MEP from Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland in parliament, weeks after members of the far-right party were caught in discussion with neo-Nazis about carrying out mass deportations. There was also concern that parliament could be used as a platform for the dissemination of conspiracy theories after Bridgen said the event, billed as a meeting of the Save Our Sovereignty campaign group, would discuss issues including “vaccine harms”, 15-minute cities and a “power grab” by the World Health Organization. Bridgen, who now sits as an independent MP after being expelled from the Conservatives for comparing the use of Covid vaccines to the Holocaust, said the meeting on Monday would be addressed by the AfD MEP Christine Anderson and two other individuals. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: “Andrew Bridgen’s fringe views and torrid misinformation have absolutely no place in the House of Commons. Bridgen and his collection of conspiracies have constantly brought our nation into the gutter, and this latest meeting adds another page to his catalogue of errors.” She added: “This MP does not represent the British people’s views.” Concern was also expressed by Labour’s Clive Lewis, who said: “You don’t give platforms to people who would take your platform away and when we talk about AFD, we are talking about a party whose members have been actively planning to deport millions of Germans who they deem to be not sufficiently German. “This is the company Andrew Bridgen is keeping and it is just really grim that they are being taken into parliament.”  Bridgen is suing Matt Hancock after the former Tory health secretary accused him of being antisemitic for likening the Covid vaccine to the Holocaust. As well as Anderson, the meeting will be addressed by Meryl Nass, who had her licence as a doctor in the US state of Maine suspended during the pandemic over the sharing of misinformation about Covid-19, and Philipp Kruse, a Swiss lawyer associated with an anti-vaccine group. Bridgen said all MPs and peers had been invited and urged followers on the X social media platform to lobby their member of parliament to attend. He told the Guardian that he was proud to speak alongside Anderson in defiance of what they saw as opposition to a “transfer of sovereignty” to the World Health Organization and “millions of Germans” supported her party. He claimed that debate about the alleged harms of vaccines was also being “shut down in parliament” and that history “would not judge kindly” those who did not ask questions about the issue. As for 15-minute cites – a concept that has become bound up in conspiracy theories about a “great reset” – he claimed this was also about “taking away the freedoms and rights of individuals”.  Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets of Germany in recent weeks in protest against the AfD. The protests began after it emerged AfD members had attended meetings with neo-Nazis and other extremists to discuss the mass deportation of migrants, asylum seekers and German citizens of foreign origin deemed to have failed to integrate. News of the gathering shocked Germany at a time when the AfD was soaring in opinion polls, months before three big regional elections in eastern Germany where its support is strongest."

        "content": "At Walsall Central mosque, a redbrick building on a street of Victorian terraces in the West Midlands market town, the imam, Murthaza Qadri, has reflected on the changing views of his congregation over the past few months. “There was never much talk about politics before but now everyone cares, lots of people are speaking up,” he said last week. “We’ve been brought up in an environment where we were blindly supporters of Labour, old and young. But now people are opening their eyes a bit more.” The issue that has opened the eyes of Muslims in Walsall and elsewhere across the country is Labour’s failure to explicitly demand a permanent ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. The party’s position has shifted in recent weeks but, with more than 25,000 casualties in Gaza and a growing humanitarian catastrophe, it is too little and too late for many Muslims. The anguish and anger felt by Muslims in the UK over the Israel-Gaza war could spell trouble for Labour at the next election. An opinion poll carried out in November by Savanta found strong support for Labour among Muslim voters, with 64% backing the party. But more than 40% said Keir Starmer’s response to the war had made them less likely to vote Labour, while 20% said it had made them more likely to do so. One in three Muslim voters rated the conflict among their top three issues in deciding who to vote for. In Ilford North, local activists have selected a candidate to challenge the 5,198 majority of the shadow health secretary Wes Streeting specifically on Labour’s position on the Gaza war. Nearly a quarter of the population is Muslim. In Walsall, where 11.3% of the population is Muslim, eight Labour councillors who resigned from the party over the issue in November are considering putting up a candidate at the general election. This month Ammar Anwar, a Labour councillor in Kirklees, Yorkshire, and a lifelong member of the party, announced his resignation in tears and with a Palestinian flag draped around his neck. Eleven Labour councillors in Burnley resigned from the party in November, 10 resigned in Oxford, eight quit in Blackburn, and there have been others. Aftab Nawaz, one of those who resigned in Walsall, said he had been inundated with messages of support from the Muslim community. “We had calls from all over the place, not just in Walsall. People were coming up to us and hugging us and saying well done, you’ve stood up for what you believe, you’ve stood up for us and you’ll always be our heroes. We’re not heroes,” he said. Nawaz said he had been unhappy with the party’s creeping “central control”, but it was its response to the war that pushed him over the edge. “We saw a side of the Labour party which we didn’t expect,” he said. “If we are sitting at home or in our mosques praying for the people of Palestine, yet we represent a party whose leader isn’t saying that this should stop, we ourselves become complicit.” He said walking away from Labour had been a difficult decision. His father, who came to work in the West Midlands metal-bashing factories, had been supported by Labour and the union movement at a time when ethnic minorities were being targeted by the National Front. “We were all Labour people and we always trusted that the Labour party would do the right thing. People voted for the Labour party without even blinking, they wouldn’t read the manifesto,” he said. He joined the party in 2000 and spent many hours campaigning as a paper candidate in wards that the party had little chance in winning – “we used to call it flying the red flag”. “You’d go out in the middle of the snow and rain deliver leaflets and get people’s doors smashed in your face because they didn’t want to know anything,” he said. “But it was something that enriched my life, and I’ll never regret being part of the Labour party. We’re still Labour people. I’ve said to people it’s not that we’ve left the Labour party, the Labour party has left us.” Qadri, the imam, who has been a party member for six years but is unlikely to vote for Labour in the next election, was confident he had a good insight into the views of the hundreds of people who attend Walsall Central mosque each week. Younger people in particular were influenced by what they saw about the conflict on social media, he said. They were emailing their MPs to demand answers and passing the message on to older generations. That message appeared to be cutting through in Walsall. Nahid Ahmed, 54, a former Labour party member of 15 years who left the party over its stance on Palestine, said he would vote for an independent candidate or abstain. “Labour thinks Muslims are going to vote [for them] anyway, but they have to understand this has changed now,” he said. Even if Starmer explicitly backed an immediate and permanent ceasefire now after months of death and destruction, it may not bring Muslim votes back into the fold. “As things are getting worse in Palestine, you would expect their sense of moral duty, their humane side, to have come out and it hasn’t. That trust is lost,” said Sajad, 40, who declined to give her surname. In the immediate aftermath of the horrific atrocities committed by Hamas and others on 7 October, the Labour leadership offered full-throated support for Israel. In an interview on LBC radio a few days later, Starmer said Israel had the right to withhold power and water in Gaza. His words – which he later sought to clarify – shocked many Labour supporters. In response, three senior frontbenchers – Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Louise Haigh – warned in a shadow cabinet meeting that Labour was at risk of losing Muslim votes. The following month, 56 Labour MPs rebelled against the leadership by backing a Scottish National party amendment to the king’s speech that explicitly called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Eight frontbenchers resigned their posts. Despite his shadow cabinet warning, Streeting was not among them. In his Ilford North constituency, protests were held outside the MP’s constituency office, and a grassroots organisation, the Redbridge Community Action Group (RCAG), was formed. “Trust has irretrievably broken down between British Muslims and the Labour party. It’s a fundamental break,” said Vaseem Ahmed, a spokesperson for the RCAG. Leading Labour MPs had shown a “lack of empathy to the 75-year suffering of the Palestinian people … For them, Palestinian lives matter much less than others,” he said. This month the RCAG held a meeting to choose an independent candidate to contest the general election. “We are proud to live in a democracy and we are using democracy to make our views known,” Ahmed said. The candidate, Leanne Mohamad, a 23-year-old British-Palestinian who grew up in the constituency, said: “It’s clear to me and countless others that Labour no longer represents the interests of working people. British Muslims are aghast at what is taking place in Gaza and they have marched in their millions to make this point.” She said Labour had failed “to hold Israel to account for its actions and they still haven’t called for an immediate ceasefire in order to save lives. The sheer hypocrisy between their position on Ukraine when compared to Gaza lays bare what many, including Muslims, now see as a party devoid of any principles whatsoever.” Mahmoud Rauf, 77, a retired accountant who has lived in the area for more than 40 years and is a lifelong Labour supporter, said he had previously canvassed for Streeting but would not do so again, and may not even vote Labour at the next election. “Wes Streeting might have a good bashing when the election comes because this area [is home to] a lot of supporters from the Palestinian side,” he said. “I don’t support [him] any more. I don’t see that he’s playing fair.” Another accountant, Imtyaz Vakil, 54, a Labour voter who switched to the Conservatives after the Iraq war, said he would never again vote for either party. He had joined RCAG and would be supporting Mohamed in the election, saying her candidacy was “the first piece in the whole jigsaw”. Political parties would ignore Muslim voices at their peril, he said. “It’s the second, third generation of Muslims here and we’re growing. We’re not just going to sit back and accept that.” In recent weeks, senior Labour figures have toughened their language in response to the scale of killing and destruction in Gaza. Last month, Streeting spoke of the need for a “sustainable ceasefire” amid “intolerable civilian casualties”. On Tuesday, Starmer told the Commons: “What is needed in Gaza is a humanitarian truce now, a sustainable ceasefire to stop the killing of innocent civilians.” Streeting told the Guardian: “For the last nine years I’ve consistently fought for all communities in Redbridge, including launching the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims … [and] campaigning for the recognition of a Palestinian state and the end of human rights abuses. The next election is a choice between five more years of Conservative failure or change for the better with Labour.”  • This article was amended on 30 January 2024 to remove text stating incorrectly that the Palestine Solidarity Campaign had registered a new pro-Palestine party."

        "content": "Keir Starmer’s office has begun polling British Muslim voters amid growing concern in senior Labour ranks about the damage done to their core vote by the row over the party’s position on the Middle East. Labour sources have told the Guardian that the party is running polls and holding focus groups around the country after senior officials became concerned they were losing support among one of their staunchest bases of support. The outreach effort is just one aspect of how the Middle East crisis has transformed the party in the last few months. MPs who care about the issue have established new groups to lobby Starmer, while the leader’s office has been forced to rethink how it communicates with parts of the party who say they have long been ignored.   Related: ‘Trust is lost’: Muslim voters unhappy with Labour’s stance on Gaza war   One senior Labour MP said: “Muslims are not only predominantly Labour supporters but they are also geographically important. There are many of them in a range of key target seats in both the south and the north-west, and we need to pay attention to that.” A frontbencher said: “We know we’ve lost the Muslim vote and at the very least their trust. The Muslim community is no longer a safe voter base for us because of how we initially responded to the war. So we’re just focused on damage control. We all know it.” A party spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer, the shadow cabinet and senior staff engage with colleagues both in the parliamentary Labour party and the wider party on this important issue. “The Labour party with Keir Starmer is committed to working alongside international partners to recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel, as part of efforts to contribute to securing a negotiated two-state solution.” The war between Israel and Hamas first triggered a crisis for Starmer when he gave an interview in October in which he said Israel had the right to withhold power and water from Gaza. He later reversed that position, but he angered many of his MPs and supporters again when he refused to back calls for a ceasefire. Tensions boiled over when 56 Labour MPs defied party orders and voted for a Scottish National party motion in the Commons calling explicitly for a ceasefire. That vote brought the resignation of eight of Starmer’s frontbench in the biggest rebellion of his leadership to date. But it also prompted Labour MPs to start new groups and re-establish old ones in an attempt to better organise the way in which they petition the leadership. Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East (LFPME) has become one of the central organising hubs. Another is a WhatsApp group of about 30 MPs who share not only policy thoughts but also security advice, given the threats made to some Labour MPs especially in areas with lots of Muslim voters. Members of the WhatsApp group are now meeting frequently with David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, and with Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray. Shabana Mahmood, the shadow justice secretary and Labour’s most senior Muslim MP, has become the de facto leader of this increasingly vocal caucus. However, tensions remain, including over recent comments by the shadow foreign minister Wayne David in which he told the Jewish Chronicle that Labour would only recognise Palestine after negotiations between Israel and Palestinians had begun. In a letter seen by the Guardian, seven backbench members of LFPME have written to Lammy arguing that the policy “effectively gives Israel a veto on Palestinian self-determination” and “will put recognition into cold storage for the foreseeable future”. In another sign of the Labour rifts being created by the war, the backbench MP Kate Osamor was suspended from the party on Sunday for referencing the “genocide” in Gaza in a post about Holocaust Memorial Day. A new poll carried out by UK in a Changing Europe demonstrates the risk for Labour, showing that nearly half of the country’s 2 million Muslim voters chose Labour at the last election. Given that a quarter of Muslims did not vote, two-thirds of those who did backed Labour. As long as Labour is 20 or more points ahead in the polls, Labour sources say these voters are unlikely to prevent the party from winning the election. But senior party figures are concerned that if the polls narrow, they could make the difference between victory and defeat in more than a dozen seats. Many of the Tory-held seats they are targeting, including Wycombe, Peterborough and Bury North, have Muslim populations well above 10%. The risk to Labour has been accentuated by the launch of a new grassroots group called The Muslim Vote, which is modelled along the lines of Operation Black Vote and aims to maximise turnout among British Muslims. TMV is organising voter drives and door-knocking campaigns in eight constituencies with the stated aim of “rewarding” MPs who vote for a ceasefire and “punishing” those who do not. A spokesperson for the group said: “It’s clear that Labour are taking the Muslim vote for granted and the Conservatives aren’t even interested in the Muslim vote. They have continuously devalued Muslim voters, the Labour strategy on Gaza has been to threaten to sack any shadow cabinet member who votes for a ceasefire.” However, officials are not only concerned about the Muslim vote. Some have also warned they risk losing votes in affluent, predominantly white parts of the country, such as Bournemouth, Bristol and Brighton, where many voters also feel strongly about the Palestinian cause. One Labour MP said: “We’re expecting to see middle-class Labour supporters sympathetic to the Gaza crisis to back the Greens because of their immediate ceasefire calls.” Another warned that younger voters in particular were being radicalised by the amount of footage they were seeing from Gaza on the social media platforms Instagram and TikTok. A party source said: “The discontent is much wider than the leadership realises. If we don’t get on top of this soon we are going to have trouble later this year.”"

        "content": "Northern Ireland’s political leaders hope to restore devolved government and fill ministerial posts within days after the Democratic Unionist party’s endorsement of a deal to restore power sharing.\nParties that are eligible to form a Stormont executive are to meet on Tuesday to chart a restoration of local rule after two years of deadlock.\nThe Irish government joined the chorus of welcome for the DUP’s decision to end a boycott of power sharing but cautioned that it and the EU had not yet seen details of the deal between the DUP and the UK government.\n“Obviously we’ll need to see that and be confident that it doesn’t have any negative consequences for the Windsor framework or for the Good Friday agreement,” said the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. “I don’t anticipate that it does but we have to see the exact detail of that first.”\nChris Heaton-Harris, the UK’s Northern Ireland secretary, said the proposals would be published on Wednesday and featured a “vast array of decent improvements”.\nEarlier on Tuesday the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, emerged from a tumultuous meeting of the party’s 130-member executive and announced that the party had accepted a deal that addressed its concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements. Donaldson said there had been a “decisive” vote in favour but did not disclose the majority.\nThe party collapsed Stormont in February 2022 in protest at arrangements that it said undermined Northern Ireland’s position in the UK and potentially paved the way to a united Ireland.\nDonaldson said the deal removed restrictions on the movement of goods within the UK. “Zero checks, zero customs paperwork on goods moving within the United Kingdom,” he told BBC Radio Ulster. “That takes away the border within the UK between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that is something that’s very important.”\nThe proposals were not perfect but good enough, he said. “Have we achieved everything that we wanted to achieve? No, we haven’t, I will be honest with people about what we’ve been able to deliver, the substantive change.”\nThe party’s endorsement is conditional on two statutory instruments at Westminster to give legislative effect to Downing Street commitments on trade and sovereignty. Heaton-Harris said London would keep its side of the bargain.\nBrussels and Dublin will scrutinise the deal to ensure that the Windsor framework – Rishi Sunak’s successor to Boris Johnson’s Northern Ireland protocol – remains intact. Conservative MPs will study it for any sign that Downing Street has weakened the ability to diverge from EU rules. Hardline unionists will seize on any evidence that Donaldson has oversold tweaks as substantive change.\nNorthern Ireland’s main political parties will be relieved to return to Stormont but there is no jubilation. Civil servants have run the region on a form of autopilot amid a fiscal crisis, crumbling public services and strikes that have bred cynicism about politics and the durability of any rebooted executive. Sinn Féin and the DUP will each retain the power to collapse Stormont.\nSinn Féin, which overtook the DUP as the biggest party in the 2022 assembly election, is poised to take the first minister post for the first time under its deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill – a historic, if symbolic, precedent. A DUP member will be eligible to be deputy first minister, a post with equal power but less prestige.\nThe DUP’s decision is a victory for Donaldson, who had to face down hardliners inside and outside his party who want a complete removal of all trade checks. The Traditional Unionist Voice and the loyalist Jamie Bryson denounced the deal as a sellout that would damage the union. They will seek to make common cause with disaffected DUP members, including those who are thought to have helped Bryson live-tweet the supposedly private meeting."

        "published_date": "2024-01-30T06:00:21+00:00",
        "content": "New Brexit border rules could cut the shelf life of fresh food from mainland Europe by a fifth and leave some deliveries from the EU unsaleable, major food bodies have warned. The SPS Certification Working group, which represents 30 trade bodies covering £100bn of the UK’s food supply, has said new rules requiring importers to notify authorities a day before they arrive in the UK was “unfeasible” and could mean that some European businesses decide to stop supplying the UK. Currently, suppliers in the EU do not need to notify the UK government before delivering meat and dairy products, meaning deliveries can arrive in the UK within hours of being dispatched from their farms or processing plants in the EU. However, under new border rules coming into effect in April, the government requires importers to notify the UK authorities at least a day before they arrive at a border post, which businesses fear will add huge delays to deliveries of perishable goods. Experts said there were particular fears over the potential impact on products with particularly short shelf lives, such as fresh unfrozen meat and some products that contain egg. In a letter to Steve Barclay, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, the group wrote: “Great Britain’s requirement for one working day pre-notification is unfeasible for just-in-time supply to GB of perishable short-shelf-life fresh foods/ingredients arriving from the EU. “A one-day delay to exportation can mean a 20% loss of shelf life, ultimately rendering the food unsaleable.” The group also argued that these delays could make supplying the UK commercially unviable for some EU companies. The SPS Working Group, formed three years ago, includes a number of food businesses, from farmers to food producers and hauliers. Members include the Fresh Produce Consortium, Chilled Food Association, Dairy UK and the Road Haulage Association. It was set up in advance of the implementation of the border target operating model, which will require European importers to provide health certificates for “medium- and high-risk” animal and plant products from 31 January. This will be followed by physical checks at the border at the end of April. Karin Goodburn, chair of the SPS and director general of the Chilled Food Association, said the 24-hour notification rules would lead to food going to waste. “You need a certain amount of time to move something fresh coming into the UK, to get it to shops and on the shelves,” she said. “You need to have at least 75% of shelf life when you receive it, either as a manufacturer or retailer, to be able to handle it, get it on the shelves and sell it. If you take off the 20%, it destroys the ability to use much of that raw food material.” Peter Hardwick, policy adviser at the British Meat Processors Association, called the 24-hour pre-notification rule “totally impractical”. He said: “Currently, if a vehicle is loaded in Ireland, it would expect to arrive at a border within six hours, eight at the most. The 24-hour rule would mean refrigerated lorries sitting in a park somewhere as the shelf life is affected.” The letter to Barclay included 16 different concerns the food industry has regarding the government’s border plans. These included concerns about the fact that the government had yet to publish the details of the opening hours of its border posts, despite the start date being just 13 weeks away. It also warned that added red tape and certification requirements limited the ability of suppliers to send different products in the same consignments, which could “curtail imports, increase food inflation and reduce UK food security”. The Guardian understands that the government will initially take a pragmatic approach to the 24-hour pre-notification, and Defra officials have indicated that if health certificates for products have been deemed acceptable, late goods will not be held. A government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to delivering the most advanced border in the world. The border target operating model is key to delivering this, protecting the UK’s biosecurity from potentially harmful pests and diseases, and maintaining trust in our exports. “We worked extensively with traders to ensure the new controls and requirements are clear and not burdensome – which is why low risk products face no additional certification or checks, while medium risk products will undergo reduced checks, minimising the risk of delays. We will continue to work closely with businesses across the UK as the controls are implemented.”"

        "content": "The Democratic Unionist party has endorsed a deal with the UK government to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, paving an end to two years of political deadlock. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would revive the mothballed Stormont executive and assembly once the government tabled promised legislation. “I am pleased to report that the party executive has now endorsed the proposals that I have put to the party,” he told a press conference early on Tuesday after facing down hardline opponents in a dramatic and chaotic five-hour meeting of the party’s 130-member executive. “The result was clear, the DUP has been decisive, I have been mandated to move forward.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements that it said undermined Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. The impasse left civil servants to run Northern Ireland on a form of auto-pilot amid a fiscal crisis, crumbling public services, strikes and doubts about whether devolved government would ever return.  Interactive  However, the boycott proved popular with DUP supporters and bolstered its electoral position, complicating Donaldson’s effort to abandon the protest.

Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, expressed optimism Stormont could return before an 8 February legislative deadline for forming an administration. “Sinn Féin will now engage with the parties and both governments to ensure we now all press on without delay,” she said. Donaldson said the deal – yet to be published – would safeguard Northern Ireland’s place in the UK and restore its place in the UK internal market. “It will remove checks for goods moving within the UK and remaining in Northern Ireland and will end Northern Ireland automatically following future EU laws,” he said.  Interactive  Conservative MPs will scrutinise the deal, once published, for any sign that Downing Street has weakened the ability to diverge from EU rules. Rishi Sunak’s administration would need to deliver legislative commitments it made to the DUP before the party would revive power sharing, said Donaldson. “The package of measures will require a significant number of actions to be taken and we look forward with confidence to their ongoing implementation, according to an agreed timeline.” On that basis the DUP would support convoking the Northern Ireland assembly to elect a speaker and facilitate the nomination of ministers, said Donaldson. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, who presided over months of tortuous negotiations with the DUP, welcomed the news and said London would keep its side of the bargain. “I now believe that all the conditions are in place for the assembly to return, the parties entitled to form an executive are meeting tomorrow to discuss these matters and I hope to be able to finalise this deal with the political parties as soon as possible.” Dublin, Brussels and Washington will also welcome the restoration of Stormont, a central plank of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Many Northern Ireland nurses, teachers, bus drivers and other public sector workers will also welcome a revived executive, which is a condition to unlock a £3.3bn financial package from London. Donaldson’s victory – and possibly his leadership – will be tested in coming days by hardliners who consider the deal a betrayal that will weaken the union, raising the prospect of a party split. Donaldson did not reveal the size of the majority in favour of the deal. Senior figures in the DUP, including Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds, had warned against a compromise that would merely tweak the Irish Sea border. Dozens of protesters, some holding union jack flags and signs saying “Stop DUP sellout”, picketed the meeting, which ended shortly before 1am. The Traditional Unionist Voice party and Jamie Bryson, a prominent loyalist, denounced Donaldson. The meeting was supposed to have been confidential but Bryson live-tweeted it, suggesting he had sources inside the room. “There’s only one betrayal, and it is of the mandate given to the DUP,” Bryson tweeted."

        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s troubled Rwanda deportation plan has been condemned by Conservative peers, historians and bishops in an indication that the House of Lords could demand changes that might delay its implementation. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor and former lord chancellor, joined the archbishop of Canterbury and the historian Peter Hennessy on Monday evening in opposing the government’s plan to overturn a ruling by the UK’s highest court and send asylum seekers to the central African country. They were among more than 60 members of the Lords listed to speak during the second reading debate of the government’s safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill. The draft legislation seeks to block the supreme court’s findings of fact that Rwanda was not a safe destination for asylum seekers because they would be at risk of refoulement. Key votes on amendments to the legislation are not expected until next month, and any proposed changes are likely to be overturned by the Commons. But the Lords could frustrate the government’s hopes of sending flights to Kigali by the spring. Lord Clarke, who has supported previous Rwanda laws, said Sunak’s bill was a “step too far”, adding: “I don’t think I can possibly support this bill unless it is substantially amended as it goes through this House, and we should urge the Commons to revise it.” He said he agreed in principle with the idea of removing migrants to a safe third country, but parliament overruling the courts on Rwanda’s safety set a “very dangerous constitutional provision”. “I hope it will be challenged properly in the courts, because we have an unwritten constitution and it gets more and more important that we do make sure that the powers in this country are controlled by some constitutional limits and are subject to the rule of law,” Clarke said. The Tory peer Viscount Hailsham, who served in the Commons as Douglas Hogg, warned of a slippery slope with the Rwanda bill, arguing that it “can end in some very murky places”. He said: “I do not believe that this bill, if enacted, will serve as an effective deterrent.”  The Conservative peer David Frost said he supported the bill but had doubts that it was “robust enough” in its current form. In a highly praised speech, the crossbench constitutional expert Lord Hennessy said the bill would diminish the UK’s standing in the world. “By rushing this emergency legislation through parliament with the intention of getting the deportation flights to Kigali under way by late spring, the government has already secured for itself a special place in British political history,” he said. “The day may not be far off when the Rwanda bill, having cleared all of its parliamentary stages, will be forwarded from the Cabinet Office to Buckingham Palace to receive Royal Assent. “In the few minutes it takes to pass down the Mall and across the tip of St James’s Park and its return journey to Whitehall, our country will change, for the government will have removed us from the list of rule-of-law nations.”  The archbishop of Canterbury warned that “a pick-and-choose approach to international law” undermined the UK’s global standing as he signalled that he might seek to block the policy at a later date. Speaking during the debate, the Most Rev Justin Welby said: “We can, as a nation, do better than this bill. With this bill, the government is continuing to seek good objectives in the wrong way, leading the nation down a damaging path. “We need a wider strategy for refugee policy which involves international cooperation and which equips us for the far greater migration flows, perhaps 10 times greater in the coming decades, as a result of conflict and climate change and poverty. Instead this bill offers only ad hoc, one-off approaches.  A Liberal Democrat-sponsored motion designed to block the bill was rejected in the Lords on Monday night, by 206 votes to 84, a majority of 122. Sunak’s bill survived third reading in the Commons after the prime minister saw off a rebellion by the Tory right that sought to toughen the legislation. In the end, just 11 Conservatives voted against the legislation, but it faces a bigger test in the Lords, where many members have expressed unease about the plan. Sunak has urged peers against blocking “the will of the people” by opposing the bill as he faces an election year for which he has made “stopping the boats” a key pledge of his leadership. Meanwhile, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned that the bill risks the UK breaching its obligations under international law. It argued that the draft legislation “undermines the universality of human rights” and in doing so “could expose people to harm and breaches of their right to life, their rights to be free from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, and their right to effective remedy”. The number of migrants who made unauthorised Channel crossings in 2024 passed 1,000 after more than 300 made the journey at the weekend."

        "content": "Nearly halfway through the weekly 36-hour fast and tempers were fraying. First the news that the Iceland boss, Richard Walker, had jumped ship to Labour and then an endless series of complaints from rightwing Tories about plans to ban disposable vapes and introduce an age limit on buying cigarettes. “FFS,” said Rishi Sunak. “Just for once, I was trying to start the week with a good news story. You’d have thought that trying to stop young people from killing themselves would be a no-brainer. But no. Turns out there’s no pleasing some people. So we’ve just ended up with more blue-on-blue action.” “No need to get so tetchy, Rish!,” said Liz Truss. “I’m not bloody tetchy. I just want things to go right for a change. One day where it looks like the Conservatives are united behind me.” “Well, I’m sorry. Look, you know I reckon you’re the ideal leader for times like these. Imagine having someone competent and charismatic? What a waste that would be given we’re going to lose the general election anyway. So far better to have someone naturally mediocre. “But even I have standards,” she stressed. “We libertarian morons must stand together. Look at it this way. If it’s OK for me to trash the economy and increase everyone’s mortgage payments, we can’t really stop kiddies smoking themselves to death.” “Count to 10 before answering Rish!,” squeaked one of his teenaged special advisers. “Don’t let her get to you. She’s not worth it.” “… Seven… Eight … Nine … 10 …,” said Sunak, breathing heavily. “I AM NOT ANGRY WITH YOU, LIZ. DEFINITELY NOT ANGRY. Now can you just shut up and listen to me. The one thing the public doesn’t mind is a good old smoking ban. And you’ve gone and wrecked it. Now the Tories just look like a rabble and we’re going to have to rely on Labour votes. Well, I personally can’t wait for the day when the first 54-year-old gets busted for selling tobacco to a 52-year-old. But while you’re all here, has anyone else got a problem? Something that will make us all look really stupid.” “Er, yes,” answered the former science minister, George Freeman. “Actually I have. Something so halfwitted, even I can’t believe I’ve done it. You see, I’ve written a Substack saying the reason I resigned as a minister was because it left me too broke. I just couldn’t get by on £118,000 per year. Every month I struggled to pay the mortgage. Then there was the fiscal drag. That was a killer. Sometimes we could only afford to give the dog dried food. I blame you, Liz.” “Well, I’m not apologising,” snapped Radon Liz. Inert, but still a gas. “The country was lucky to have me.” “So let’s get this straight,” shouted Rish!. “You actually wrote that you couldn’t get by on the best part of £120,000 due to the Tories having wrecked the economy? “You are getting ratty now, aren’t you? Have a sandwich.” “FOR THE LAST TIME … I AM NOT RATTY. As I said, I just want something to go right. One thing. Is that too much to ask? And now I’ve got to deal with a complete deadbeat. I thought we’d reached the stupidity bar with Lee Anderson, but you’ve just lowered it still further. Look. I know that £118,000 is teetering on the breadline. I couldn’t get by on it either. But the whole point of the Conservatives is to convince everyone that £25,000 is untold riches. The junior doctors will never settle now.” Freeman started sobbing. “You just don’t understand,” he croaked, wiping his eyes. “I was at my wit’s end. The thing about being a minister is that it’s so much harder to be on the take. I mean, make. At least being a backbencher, you can crack on with any number of freelance gigs. “Hell, Liz regularly gets paid over £50,000 for speeches on how to bankrupt a country. All I’m asking for is for an in on a deal like the Teesside development. Imagine being able to buy an acre of land for £1 and to make £124m in two years without investing a penny of your own money. And it’s not even corrupt!!! Fancy that! That’s definitely my kind of work.” “I think you will find there’s a long queue for those types of jobs, George,” said Rish! snippily. “In the meantime, why couldn’t you try and do something useful with your life? Like signing up to be an army reservist. Last week, I couldn’t move for Tories claiming they were going to enlist. Now you all seem to have gone rather quiet about it.” “L/Cpl Boris Johnson reporting for duty!” “Now I’ve seen it all,” said Sunak. The recruiting sergeant looked doubtfully at the superb specimen of humanity that stood before him. He must be able to run three miles in at least a couple of hours. The type of man who saved the free world at Tobruk and D-day. Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler? Cometh the hour, cometh the man. “I’ve long dreamed of serving my country. To give something back …,” said Boris. “Well, you’ve done your best to destroy it so far. Maybe you could now direct some of your negative energy to our enemies. Any criminal convictions? Ah … Of course you have. Children? Shall I just put down, ‘Can’t quite remember’? Now, do you have any special talents we should know about?” “I’ve done some cold weather training. I once hid in a fridge for 10 minutes. So I might suit the SAS on special ops in the Arctic.” “Actually, I might have just the thing for you. We need more precision weapons for taking out the Houthis in Yemen. You would make the perfect human bouncing bomb. A low run over the Red Sea and then over the shore and straight into the drone launching centre. It would be a one-way mission but we are looking for men like you.” “Um, perhaps not,” said Brave Sir Boris. Meanwhile in the Commons, Kemi Badenoch was, as ever, otherwise engaged – “I am definitely Team Rish!” – so it was up to the junior business minister, Kevin Hollinrake, to explain why his boss had fired the Post Office chair two days earlier. It was like this. When they had appointed Henry Staunton they had wanted someone who wouldn’t do much about the Horizon scandal. Now the ITV drama had raised people’s awareness, that was no longer an option. And Kemi had needed to look tough the day before doing a TV interview with Laura Kuenssberg. Or that’s what he meant to say. He actually had to pretend it was nothing to do with Horizon and that the timing was coincidental. Still, at least there was almost no one in parliament to hear Kev’s excuses. MPs are no longer that bothered about the Post Office. That was last week’s scandal. Not even that heroic champion of the post office operator, Lee Anderson – who once spoke for 20 seconds about the scandal two years ago, was there. Perhaps he was too busy, like Freeman, trying to earn an honest bob from his second job as a GB News presenter. He too struggles to make ends meet on £185,000. This is no way to run a country. The UK is no longer serious. Or credible."

        "content": "Kemi Badenoch is a member of a Conservative WhatsApp group called “Evil Plotters” despite telling party rebels to “stop messing around” and get behind Rishi Sunak, the Guardian can reveal. The business secretary, who consistently comes out as the favourite cabinet minister in polls of Tory members, has criticised party colleagues for “stirring” up suggestions that she could replace the prime minister. In a round of broadcast interviews on Sunday, she dismissed speculation over the plot to topple Sunak as “Westminster tittle-tattle” and said colleagues who put her name forward as an alternative were “not my friends”. However, the Guardian has been told that Badenoch and Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, who is regarded as a key backer, are members of a WhatsApp group of similarly minded Tory MPs who are rallying round the business secretary’s longer-term ambitions. Tory sources said that while Badenoch was not actively plotting to remove Sunak before the next election, her team was ready to “leap into action” should the prime minister be forced out, or if he stood down as party leader following an election defeat. Speculation has swirled at Westminster after a group of anonymous Tory donors funded a poll suggesting Sunak was leading his party to electoral oblivion at the next election, prompting speculation over who may be behind a plot. There is no suggestion Badenoch is involved. However, the Guardian understands that when Suella Braverman was sacked as home secretary two months ago, some of Badenoch’s allies advised her to lie low and wait for the row to blow over so that she would emerge as “the reasonable face” of the Tory right. “Kemi won’t try to oust Rishi herself, she knows that the hand that wields the knife never wears the crown,” said one Tory insider. “But she’s got a campaign ready for when the moment does eventually come.” One friend of Badenoch suggested that while she had not explicitly instructed her allies to plan and prepare for a leadership campaign, she had given them the nod to continue. “It will be with her permission rather than at her behest,” they said. “She won’t be having meetings with people saying”: ‘When are we setting up the phone banks?’ She finds all of that distasteful. She isn’t going to be doing what Penny Mordaunt is doing, which is endless little drinks parties stroking people’s egos. She hates that.” Tory MPs say Badenoch remains close to Gove, despite reports last year that the pair had fallen out, and that they have re-established a working relationship and speak regularly. In recent weeks they have also messaged on the Evil Plotters WhatsApp group, perhaps an ironic nod to the former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries’ book The Plot, which claimed Gove was trying to install Badenoch as leader, which allies of both have denied. The business secretary also holds regular lunches with her key MP backers, believed to include the housing minister, Lee Rowley, the digital minister, Julia Lopez, the Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart, and the Tory deputy chair for women, Rachel Maclean. They were among the MPs who supported her during the Tory leadership contest to take over from Boris Johnson, when she made it to the final four. Rowley, who was Badenoch’s campaign manager in 2022, is said to have continued unofficially in the role. James Roberts, the former chief of the TaxPayers’ Alliance who ran Badenoch’s list of endorsements in 2022, joined her team as a special adviser in June 2023, with sources suggesting he is “still working on leadership stuff” despite his official role. A spokesperson for Badenoch did not deny the WhatsApp group claim but said: “This is exactly the sort of stirring Kemi was referring to when she told people to stop messing around on Sunday. “Having lunch, speaking to MPs, and having a parliamentary special adviser is not a plot, it is the day-to-day job of being a secretary of state. This utter nonsense is clearly part of a targeted campaign against Kemi and anyone reading it should treat it as such.” On a tour of the broadcast studios on Sunday, Badenoch did not deny having aspirations for the top job, telling the BBC: “If you’d asked me two years ago in January 2022 I would have laughed it off and said it was a completely crazy idea. “You never really know these things until you’re in the moment. What I would remind people is that after Liz Truss left I stood up and said I’m not running again; Rishi’s the person who should do the job. I did so because I worked with him [at] the Treasury, I knew he had a handle on the economy.” She also said that speculation among Tory colleagues about her ambitions was “all a distraction”, telling Sky News: “They need to stop messing around and get behind the leader. “The fact of the matter is most people in the country are not interested in all of this Westminster tittle-tattle. Quite frankly, the people who keep putting my name in there are not my friends. They don’t care about me. They don’t care about my family or what this would entail. They are just stirring.” On Tuesday, the former cabinet minister Simon Clarke, a Liz Truss ally, claimed the Tories faced electoral “massacre” under Sunak. The latest turmoil for the Tory leader was triggered by the opinion poll that put his party on course for a 1997-style wipeout. At the same time, the Tory peer David Frost argued that the party would “lose and lose bad unless we do something about it”. He was named as the contact on the YouGov research, but it was commissioned by a mysterious group calling itself the Conservative Britain Alliance. Lord Frost is understood to have been warned by Nicholas True, the Conservative whip in the Lords, that he could have the Tory whip withdrawn if the donors behind the group had given money to Nigel Farage’s Reform party. Frost has refused to provide names. Sources at Tory headquarters said Frost was hoping to be selected for Basildon and Billericay, the party’s 35th safest seat, but raised doubts over whether he would be permitted. “It’s very difficult to see how he would stand as a candidate,” one said."

(See 5.42pm.)\n\n\nAn inquiry has concluded that some of the decisions taken by bodies involved in the Teesworks redevelopment “do not meet the standards expected when managing public funds”. (See 5.44pm.)\n\n\nGeorge Freeman, who resigned from government last year, has said that he quit because he could not afford rising mortgage repayments on his £120,000 ministerial salary.\n\n\nNicola Sturgeon broke confidentiality and “jumped the gun” when she announced a ban on mass gatherings in Scotland before other parts of the UK agreed to the move during the pandemic, the UK Covid inquiry has heard.\n\n\nThe Democratic Unionist party is to consider ending its two-year boycott of power-sharing in Northern Ireland at a meeting tonight that could make or break Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s leadership.\n\n\nUK ministers will aim to stop firms from skirting around an upcoming ban on disposable vapes by eliminating ruses such as attaching charging points to them, Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, has said.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.18pm GMT\n\n\n 5.53pm GMT \n\nBen Houchen, who as Conservative Tees Valley mayor has facilitated and championed the Teesworks redevelopment scheme, claims it has been vindicated by the report published this afternoon because it says that there is no evidence of corruption and illegality – despite what has been suggested by some media reports, and by Labour.\n\n@TeesworksUK Independent Review published👉 In black and white, “no evidence to support allegations of corruption or illegality”.Confirms land was not sold for £100, but instead a wider deal was done worth £39m.❌@AndyMcdonaldMP LIED and cost Teesside investment & jobs.\n\n\n\n🚨 @TeesworksUK Independent Review published👉 In black and white, “no evidence to support allegations of corruption or illegality”.Confirms land was not sold for £100, but instead a wider deal was done worth £39m.❌@AndyMcdonaldMP LIED and cost Teesside investment & jobs. pic.twitter.com/40Ckkblef0— Ben Houchen (@BenHouchen) January 29, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.44pm GMT \nInquiry finds some Teesworks redevelopment decisions 'do not meet standards expected' for managing public funds\n\nThe government has just published its Tees Valley review, the report into the Teesworks redevelopment including the Teesside freeport. Here is the 96-page report, and here are the executive summary and recommendations.\nThe summary says:\n\nThe review panel has now completed its work within the scope of the terms of reference. Based on the information shared with the panel, we have found no evidence to support allegations of corruption or illegality. However, there are issues of governance and transparency that need to be addressed and a number of decisions taken by the bodies involved do not meet the standards expected when managing public funds. The panel have therefore concluded that the systems of governance and finance in place within TVCA [the Tees Valley Combined Authority] and STDC [the South Tees Development Corporation] at present do not include the expected sufficiency of transparency and oversight across the system to evidence value for money.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.47pm GMT\n\n\n 5.32pm GMT \nKen Clarke says he can't support new Rwanda bill as he did last one because overturning supreme court 'very dangerous'\n\nLast year, when the House of Lords was debating the illegal migration bill, the original legislation underpinning the Rwanda policy, there was a suprise intervention from Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor. Despite being seen as a leading figure on the liberal wing of the Tory party, Clarke told peers he was backing the policy because he did not think anyone had a better solution to the problem caused by small boats.\nBut there is bad news for the government. In a speech this afternoon in the second reading debate, Clarke revealed that he had switched sides.\nHe said that he still thought the public needed to be reassured that the government was in control of its borders, and he still thought it was acceptable to remove migrants to a safe third country.\nBut he said the proposal to send them to Rwanda hit a “brick wall” when it was vetoed by the supreme court. And the government’s response was “quite startling”, he said. He went on:\n\nThey have decided to bring an act of parliament to overturn a finding of fact made by the supreme court of this country, and if we pass this bill, we are asserting as a matter of law that Rwanda is a safe country for this purpose, that it is always going to be a safe country for this purpose until the law is changed, and the courts may not even consider any evidence brought before them to try to demonstrate that is not a safe country.\nThis is a very dangerous constitutional provision. I hope it will be challenged properly in the courts because we have an unwritten constitution, and it gets more and more important that we do ensure that powers in this country are controlled by some constitutional limits, and are subject to the rule of law.\nSomebody has already said in this debate that parliament apparently, claiming the sovereignty of parliament, can claim that the colour black is the same as the colour white, or dogs are cats.\n\nClarke said he agreed with all peers saying the legislation should be conditional on Rwanda actually showing that it has complied with the treaty it has signed saying it will implement safeguards to its immigration system. As the bill went through the Lords, he would probably back some “startling amendments”, he said.\nHe said the government had placed far too much faith in the Rwanda policy.

She said:\n\nI would like to say at this point – I have said it before, but I want it read into the record here – that I was personally very concerned about our care sector, both our residential care sector and the care at home sector for adults, and regret very much, and will do for the rest of my life, any deaths that occurred there because of action that the Scottish government didn’t take or did take but could have done better.\n\nAs PA Media reports, Freeman said the issue of discharging patients from hospital to care homes without testing them for Covid was a “complex issue”.\nShe said that while 348 care homes had outbreaks of Covid, “some care homes that received discharges did not have outbreaks”. She went on:\n\nI am not saying that the discharge from hospital without a test had no impact, what I am saying is that it was one of the factors.\n\nWhen Jamie Dawson KC, counsel for the inquiry, put it to Freeman that the Scottish government’s response to the problem of Covid in care homes was “completely inadequate”, Freeman replied:\n\nIt was not as adequate as I would have wished it to be.\nI believe it was all that could be done with the resources available to us at that point, and that improved as time passed.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.55pm GMT\n\n\n 4.35pm GMT \nHouseholds in England face above-inflation £2bn council tax raid\n\nHouseholds across England are facing an inflation-busting £2bn council tax raid this spring despite Rishi Sunak’s promise of pre-election giveaways to save his premiership, Richard Partington reports.

He said:\n\nI’ve got a nasty feeling that what is going to surprise us is what was actually legal.\nBecause it would appear, certainly looking at the accounts that we’ve pored over, it does look like here you’ve got a company that was basically given the option to buy public land at about £1 an acre, we’ve given away shares in a company that did this so that 90% are now owned by these two businesspeople, and they were then able to go on and sell all of the scrap metal on the site for about £50m. They then leased the land that they’d been given to help build a windfarm factory, then sold that lease for £75m.

But this is the first time the true extent of his abstemiousness has emerged.\nA source close to the PM said: “It’s true, he doesn’t eat anything at all on a Monday. It’s remarkable really given that he is often on visits or doing PMQ prep on a Monday. It’s a real testament to the discipline, focus and determination that he shows in all aspects of his life and work.”\n\nIntermittent fasting is said to bring various health benefits.\nWhen asked about his habit by the BBC’s health editor, Hugh Pym, Sunak said fasting was “an important discipline for me”.\nBut he also implied this was about allowing him to indulge his sugar habit at other times during the week. He said he had “a weakness for sugary things” and he explained:\n\nI tend to try and do some fasting at the beginning of every week as part of a general balanced lifestyle but everyone will do this differently … It means that I can then indulge myself in all the sugary treats I like for the rest of the week.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.37pm GMT\n\n\n 2.10pm GMT \nGove claims Scottish government's handling of Covid sometimes motivated by partisan, pro-independence concerns\n\nDuring his evidence to the UK Covid inquiry in Edinburgh this morning, Michael Gove, who was Cabinet Office minister during the pandemic, in charge of relations with the devolved governments, and who is now levelling up secretary, repeatedly sought to downplay claims that relations between the UK and Scottish governments during Covid were fractious or dysfunctional. (See 11.37am.)\nBut even Gove could not claim it was all sweet harmony. Here are some of the excerpts from his evidence about the tensions.\n\nGove said the SNP did not want inter-governmental relations to work. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, did, he said. But he went on: “With the best will in the world the SNP don’t want inter-government relations to work.”\n\n\nHe said that at times the Scottish government was acting in a partisan manner. When it was put to him that the relationship between the two governments was “completely dysfunctional”, he replied:\n\n\nNo, I don’t believe they are politically motivated in everything they do. I think, I have great respect for the professionalism with which many [Scottish government] ministers conducted themselves. I do believe their overwhelming motivation was to protect the people of Scotland from a virus.\nHowever, there are and were occasions when the [Scottish government] was thinking politically, as we can see, and of course it is the case the SNP has a political mission to achieve Scotland’s independence, ie destroy the United Kingdom and it would be naive not to be aware that highly skilled politicians, including those at the top of the Scottish government, might well see what they perceive to be political advantage at certain points.\n\n\nHe said some of the Scottish government’s language was motivated by a desire for “differentiation”. He said:\n\n\nSome of the language used, the desire to have ‘a good old-fashioned rammy with the UK government’ and some of the other language used, which I shan’t repeat now, does lead me to believe that at that point, there was a desire to pursue differentiation for the sake of advancing a political agenda.\n\n\nHe said it was an understatement to say that Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon were not soulmates. In his witness statement Gove said Sturgeon, the then first minister, and Johnson, the then PM, were not soulmates. Asked if this was “something of an understatement”, Gove replied:\n\n\nUnderstatement is sometimes the most effective means of communication.\n\n\nHe said Sturgeon caused “irritation” in No 10 when she announced on 12 March 2020 that she wanted to ban gatherings of more than 500 people in Scotland. He said that was “divergent” from what had been agreed at an earlier UK Cobra meeting.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.23pm GMT\n\n\n 1.32pm GMT \nStarmer welcomes endorsement from Iceland boss and former Tory donor Richard Walker\n\nKeir Starmer has hinted that the Iceland supermarket boss Richard Walker could play a role supporting a Labour government.\nHe made the comment as he visited a branch of Iceland in Warrington, after Walker, a former Tory donor, used an article in the Guardian to decare his support for Labour.\n\n Related: Britain needs sound leadership after years of chaos. That’s why I quit the Tories – and now back Labour | Richard Walker \n\nCommenting on Walker’s endorsement, Starmer said:\n\nI’m delighted at the reason he’s come out for the Labour party, because he recognised that we’re a changed Labour party, that we’re pro-working people, we’re serious about the cost-of-living crisis and about stability and long-term strategy.\nI think it further cements the real profound way in which the Labour party has changed under my leadership, as we go into this all-important year of the general election.\n\nAsked about a potential job for Walker in a Labour government, Starmer replied:\n\nRichard Walker is wanting to work with us.

Asked if he supported the PM’s announcement, Starmer told journalists:\n\nYes, I support the banning of disposable vapes, not least because of the impact they have on children.\nWe’ve been calling for this for two years. So I do have a question for the government, which is why has it taken two years to get to this stage? We’ve wasted two years.\n\nStarmer also suggested that Rishi Sunak was only allowing his MPs a free vote on this because he could not get them to back him. He said:\n\nI’ve also got concerns that apparently the prime minister is going to give his MPs a free vote, because he doesn’t think that he’s able to hold his own team together.\nLuckily the Labour party will always act in the national interest. We will vote for it and so this measure will go through. It’ll only go through because the Labour party is the grown-up in the room and is prepared to act in the national interest and vote for this important measure.\n\nSunak argues that, in allowing his MPs a free vote, he is following precedent.

He is a fierce critic of the government’s Rwanda bill and when peers were debating the illegal migration bill last year (a precursor of the bill being debated today, subject to very similar legal and human rights objections), he denounced it as immoral.\nAsked how the government would respond if he made similar comments today, the PM’s spokesperson said:\n\nThis bill is a key part of how we stop violent criminal gangs targeting vulnerable people that has led to too many deaths in the English Channel.\nThat is the right thing to do, it is also the fair thing to do, both for taxpayers and for those individuals seeking to come here through safe and legal routes who see their place jumped by those who can afford to make crossings on small boats.\nWe’ve worked very carefully both on the bill and the treaty in coordination with the Rwanda government and we continue to believe that this bill is the right way forward to get the flights off the ground and to stop the boats.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.56pm GMT\n\n\n 12.39pm GMT \nNo 10 says it is disappointed rail companies not using new minimum service levels law to reduce impact of rail strikes\n\nOne of the most controversial bills passed last year was the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act, which is designed to ensure that in key public services, if unions stage a strike, some staff will have to carry on working to ensure that a basic level of service is provided. The legislation was partly designed to minimimise the disruption caused by rail strikes.\nBut, in the rail industry at least, the legislation is not working as planned. It relies on employers, not the government, deciding to activate the MSL powers and, in strike action starting today, the train companies have decided not to, because they don’t want to further antagonise the unions.\nAs Gwyn Topham explains in his story:\n\nThe set of strikes was expected to be the first test of the minimum service levels legislation, designed to allow train operators to run 40% of the normal timetable. Only LNER, one of the three operators directly run by the Department for Transport, planned to use the new powers to demand that drivers break the strike. An immediate escalation by Aslef, which called five additional days of strikes at LNER, prompted a climbdown.\nRail industry bosses as well as unions had made clear their reservations in consultations and select committee hearings ahead of the strike laws being introduced, which could also be applied in health, education and firefighters disputes. Labour has said it will immediately repeal the laws if elected.\n\nThis has particularly enraged the Daily Mail, which has splashed on a story about rail bosses getting big bonuses despite not using the new law.\n\n\nMAIL: Strike hell on trains as chiefs cash in #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/ZeBouQbZ5A— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) January 28, 2024\n\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said rail companies should be using the MSL powers.

He explains:\n\nGiven that the median UK voter is very fond of bans, I think it is unlikely, to put it mildly, that these changes will ever be reversed by a future government. Certainly they are not going to be overturned by a Labour administration: on the whole, Labour MPs are much more supportive of these measures than Conservative counterparts. (If you want to get a Labour MP to say something nice about the prime minister, ask them what they think of his anti-smoking measures.)\nThe depth of support for these policies on the opposition benches is one reason why they will a) pass into law and b) come with the risk of a large Tory rebellion. It’s a free hit in lots of ways if you are a Conservative MP who wants to show a bit of libertarian leg.\nBut regardless, these measures will overcome the opposition and endure. Don’t bet on either libertarian Conservatives or liberal Labour MPs having the numbers or influence to turn around what will almost certainly be Sunak’s most lasting legacy on the UK.\n\n\n\n\n 11.55am GMT \n\n\n\n\n 11.53am GMT \nSunak urges Iran to de-escalate tensions in Middle East\n\nRishi Sunak has urged Iran to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East after three US troops were killed in a drone strike in Jordan, PA Media reports.

The inquiry is currently looking at governance and decision-making issues, and the Edinburgh hearings have focused on aspects relating to Scotland.\nThe inquiry has already heard considerable evidence about disputes in Covid policy between the UK and Scottish governments – last week it emerged Nicola Sturgeon, the then first minister, regarded Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, as a “fucking clown”, but this morning the main thrust of Gove’s evidence has played down all talk of tensions and insisted that relations, overall, were good. As the Cabinet Office minister at the time, he was the UK government minister responsible for liaising with the devolved governments.\nAt one point he was asked about an exchange of messages he had with Matt Hancock, the then UK health secretary, in which Hancock objected to the devolved governments being consulted about a report from the Joint Biosecurity Centre.\nHancock said:\n\nI’ve now read that sub [submission], I’m very unhappy with it. The JBC was designed to be a UK institution that gathers and analyses data. There is no need to run it through a committee of four nations. We wouldn’t put English local authorities on the board!\n\nWhen it was put to Gove that this was indicative of London’s attitude to the Scottish government, he replied:\n\nNo, I don’t believe so. Naturally there were some within the UK government who found it irksome that the Scottish government may have taken a different view, but overall the way in which the UK government worked was respectful of and inclusive towards the Scottish government.\n\nAnd, at another point in his evidence, talking generally, he said:\n\nOf course there were differences in approach and of course we had different political parties operating, but day-to-day management and day-to-day responsibilities exercised by ministers in devolved admins and in UK government was for the most part constructive.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm GMT\n\n\n 11.13am GMT \nSunak hits back at Truss over gradual smoking ban, saying there is nothing unconservative about protecting children\n\nRishi Sunak has rejected Liz Truss’s claim that his plan to gradually ban all cigarette sales – by raising the legal age for buying them by one year every year, so that today’s 14-year-olds can never buy them legally – is unconservative.\nSpeaking to broadcasters this morning, he said:\n\nI don’t think there’s anything unconservative about caring about our children’s health.\n\nBut he also stressed that Conservative MPs would be offered a free vote on this. He said:\n\nOn smoking, there’s been a long tradition in parliament of these being free votes which aren’t party political. People will have their own views on that. That’s the same as it’s been in the past.\nBut I think this is the right long-term thing for our country. Smoking causes one in four cancer deaths. It’s responsible for a hospitalisation every minute. And if we don’t do something about it, hundreds of thousands of people will die in the coming years.\nWe do have a chance to do something about it. And if we raise the smoking age incrementally, that will mean people will stop smoking. The vast majority of people take up smoking when they are young. If we can stop that start, we will be well on the way to making sure we have the first smoke-free generation in our country.\n\nSunak was referring to votes like the one in 2006 to ban smoking in pubs, and the one in 2014 to ban smoking in cars containing children, both of which were free votes.\n\nUpdated at 12.15pm GMT\n\n\n 10.52am GMT \nRwanda bill 'undermines universality of human rights', says Equality and Human Rights Commission\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission has also expressed concerns about the legality of the Rwanda bill. The commission has repeatedly raised doubts about the lawfulness of the government’s Rwanda policy and, in a briefing paper for peers before the second reading debate in the Lords this afternoon, it says:\n\nThe bill:\n– risks breaching the UK’s legal obligations under the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and other international human rights treaties by subjecting individuals to the risk of refoulement and other breaches of their human rights;\n– undermines the fundamental principle of the universality of human rights and damages our human rights legal framework; and\n– has regressive implications for the rule of law and the separation of powers.\n\nA spokesperson for the commission said:\n\nHuman rights are universal and must be guaranteed for all.\nThe Human Rights Act (HRA) has significantly improved human rights protections for everyone in the UK, but the safety of Rwanda bill undermines the universality of human rights by disapplying core provisions of the HRA.\nOn the face of the bill, the home secretary was unable to confirm that it complies with the European convention on human rights. By disapplying sections of the HRA and seeking to prevent courts from considering the risk of refoulement, this bill could expose people to harm and breaches of their right to life, their rights to be free from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and their right to effective remedy.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.16pm GMT\n\n\n 10.35am GMT \nRwanda bill will breach international law to combat human trafficking, says thinktank\n\nWith peers preparing to debate the government’s safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill this afternoon, new claims have been made that it breaches human rights law.\nWhile other critiques have focused on whether the legislation is compliant with international law relating to refugees, the latest report focuses on its relationship to international law relating to human trafficking and modern slavery.\nThe 17-page analysis has been published by the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre (Modern Slavery PEC), a specialist thinktank linked to the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law.\nIn a summary of the report, Modern Slavery PEC said:\n\nThis analysis has found that the removal to Rwanda of people who either are confirmed victims of modern slavery or human trafficking or there are reasonable grounds to believe they may be victims raises serious issues under both the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings (ECAT), irrespective of any claim they may have under international refugee law.\nIt concluded that, in its current form, neither the Rwanda treaty nor the safety of Rwanda bill comply with the UK’s international legal obligations.\nThe legal analysis has found that removing to Rwanda people who received a positive ‘reasonable grounds’ decision (the first stage of a process formally identifying people as victims of modern slavery), without completing the identification process – as envisaged by article 13 of the Rwanda treaty – will automatically and in all cases put the UK in breach of article 4 ECHR (prohibition of slavery and forced labour), as well as article 10 ECAT (obligation to identify and assist every victim of modern slavery and human trafficking).\nIn addition, removing identified victims of modern slavery and human trafficking without conducting an individualised assessment of the risk of re-trafficking would breach the operational duty under article 4 ECHR.\nLastly, removing potential or confirmed victims of modern slavery and human trafficking risks interfering with an obligation to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of modern slavery and human trafficking contained in article 4 ECHR and article 27 ECAT.\n\nMarija Jovanovic, a law lecturer at Essex University and a trafficking/modern slavery specialist who wrote the report, said:\n\nUnlike international treaties designed to protect asylum seekers and refugees, the anti-trafficking instruments expressly require states not to remove suspected victims of human trafficking before their status is determined.\nDrafted over half a century after the 1951 refugee convention, these obligations are much more explicit, concrete and demanding when it comes to protection requirements.\n\nThe Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings (ECAT) was only agreed in 2005.\n\nUpdated at 12.20pm GMT\n\n\n 10.08am GMT \n\nA reader asks:\n\nIs it true what Liz Truss says that the NZ govt are rolling back their plans for a smoking ban?

PA says:\n\nChill Brands saw shares slide by as much as 35% in early trading as a result, while rival business Supreme saw shares drop around 12%.\nChill’s market value had fallen by over £3m, with over £10m knocked off Supreme’s valuation during the morning trading session.\nThe announcement forms part of the government’s response to its consultation on smoking and vaping, which was launched in October last year.\nThe ban is expected to come into force at the end of 2024 or the start of 2025.\nOn Monday, Chill Brands, which makes nicotine-free vapes as well as CBD products, stressed that it is “committed to strict compliance with all relevant laws”.\nCallum Sommerton, the chief executive of Chill, said it will continue to sell its products across UK and US retailers but they are prepared to adjust to rule changes.\nHe said: “The vaping landscape is constantly evolving, creating opportunities for businesses that are able to navigate the regulatory environment. The Chill brand has gained rapid traction with the support of major retailers, and I am confident that it will continue to do so as we move forward with our plans to launch reusable pod system vapes.\n“Chill Brands Group is an agile company, and we are prepared to adjust to any legislation that may be enacted.”\nRival Supreme, which has brands including 88Vape, has yet to comment on the latest announcement, but it said in October that it was “fully supportive of any further legislation in the sector”.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.23pm GMT\n\n\n 9.27am GMT \nLiz Truss says Sunak’s plan to gradually ban cigarette sales is ‘absurd' and 'profoundly unconservative’\n\nGood morning. Two weeks ago Rishi Sunak saw off the Tory rebels wanting him to toughen up the Rwanda bill, and last week the former cabinet minister Simon Clarke was shouted down by colleagues when he called for a new leader, but the turmoil in the party never really goes away these days, and today Liz Truss, Sunak’s predecessor, is fomenting revolt on another issue.\nTruss has delivered a withering attack on Sunak’s proposal to gradually ban the next generations from ever being able to buy cigarettes. She opposed the idea as soon as Sunak announced it at the Conservative party conference last year, but today she has gone further, describing the proposal as “absurd” and “profoundly unconservative”. In a statement, she said:\n\nWhile the state has a duty to protect children from harm, in a free society adults must be able to make their own choices about their own lives.\nBanning the sale of tobacco products to anyone born in 2009 or later will create an absurd situation where adults enjoy different rights based on their birth date.\nA Conservative government should not be seeking to extend the nanny state. This will only give succour to those who wish to ban further choices of which they don’t approve.\nThe newly elected National government in New Zealand is already reversing the generational tobacco ban proposed by the previous administration.\nThe government urgently needs to follow suit and reverse this profoundly unconservative policy.\n\nTruss was responding to an announcement from the Department of Health and Social Care saying that, following a consultation, the government intends to go ahead with plans to ban the sale of disposable vapes, to take other steps to halt already illegal vape sales to children, and to ban cigarette sales permanently for anyone born on or after 1 January 2009.\nThe DHSC said legislation to do this (a tobacco and vapes bill was promised in the king’s speech) would be introduced “shortly”.\nThe DHSC announcement covers England and Wales, but the Scottish government has said it will do the same, and legislation is due to cover Northern Ireland too.\nVictoria Atkins, the health secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and she has defended the plan to increase the legal age for buying cigarettes by one year every year, so that 14-year-olds never get the chance to buy a cigarette legally.\nIn response to Truss’s comments, she told BBC Breakfast:\n\nI’m old enough to remember a time when you could walk into a pub and it was filled with smoke and everybody at the time when that [banning smoking in pubs] was being debated said: ‘Oh, this will never work’. Nowadays of course you would be astonished if somebody tried to spark up a cigarette in a pub or a public facility.\n\nAnd she told LBC:\n\nI think it’s rather like the debate that we had a decade ago about whether adults should be able to smoke in cars with their children. There was a lot of debate about that. But are we honestly saying now, 10 to 12 years later, that we would go back? Of course not.\n\nLabour is supporting the legislation, so there is no risk of the bill not being passed. But there may be dozens of Tory MPs who agree with Truss, and who might be willing to vote against the government. When Atkins was asked on the Today programme if she was confident Conservative MPs would back the bill, she sidestepped the question, saying:\n\nWe have the support of mums and dads and smokers across the country. Smokers keep coming up to me saying I wish I’d never taken up smoking.\n\nWe will be hearing from Sunak on this later.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\nMorning: Rishi Sunak is on a visit in the north-east of England.\n10am: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary and former Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the UK Covid inquiry in Edinburgh. (During Covid he was the UK minister in charge of liaising with the devolved administrations.)\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\nMorning: Keir Starmer is visiting a branch of Iceland in the north-west of England. The Iceland boss, Richard Walker, a former Tory donor, has used an article for the Guardian to endorse Labour.\nAfter 3pm: Peers begin debating the second reading of the safety of Rwanda (immigration and asylum) bill.

        "content": "An MP who resigned from government last year has said that he quit because he could not afford rising mortgage repayments on his £120,000 ministerial salary. George Freeman said that an increase from £800 to £2,000pcm in his mortgage payments from this month was one of the reasons why he resigned during the cabinet reshuffle in November. The MP for Mid Norfolk, whose most recent role was science minister, cited the figures last week in a Substack blog post, “Why did I stand down?”. One of the reasons, he said, was “because my mortgage rises this month from £800pcm to £2,000, which I simply couldn’t afford to pay on a ministerial salary”.  He added: “That’s political economy 2.0. We’re in danger of making politics something only hedge fund donors, young spin doctors and failed trade unionists can afford to do.” He said five frontbench roles under five prime ministers had also left him “exhausted, bust and depressed”. Freeman, who has been an MP since 2010, would have been receiving an annual salary of about £118,300 before deductions. He was left with financial overheads after a divorce from his wife, a lawyer from whom he separated in 2014. He is paying maintenance costs for his two children and their educational costs. Freeman held a number of ministerial posts in successive Conservative governments and benefited from severance payments after departing. This included receiving £7,920 when he quit Boris Johnson’s government in July 2022, before returning to his role as science minister 16 weeks later under Rishi Sunak, according to an analysis by Labour. Ministers under 65 are entitled to a loss-of-office payment amounting to a quarter of their ministerial salary if they leave their role and are not appointed to a new one within three weeks. After leaving government, which he described as a “cruel mistress”, Freeman wrote in his blog that he now had the “greatest freedom of all – to speak and write and talk openly about what I’ve learnt”. On top of his MP’s salary of £86,584, he is now also free to take on lucrative second jobs, subject to the approval of the anti-corruption watchdog, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. Notwithstanding his own overheads, the MP is likely to be in a very different situation from many homeowners across the UK, who are collectively facing a £19bn increase in mortgage costs as millions of fixed-rate deals expire and borrowers are forced to renegotiate their home loans. Up to 1.5m households are expected to come to the end of cheaper deals in 2024, leading to an average increase in annual housing costs of about £1,800, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank following Liz Truss’s mini-budget in September 2022. When Freeman’s comments were put to the prime minister’s spokesperson, who was asked if Sunak was paying his ministers enough, he said: “There are ways for which both MPs’ and ministers’ pay are set and there are no plans to change that. It is right that we ensure ministerial pay reflects the wider fiscal situation.”"

        "content": "Households across England are facing an inflation-busting £2bn council tax raid this spring despite Rishi Sunak’s promise of pre-election giveaways to save his premiership. In a deal to address the worsening financial crisis hitting town halls across the country, officials in Michael Gove’s levelling up department have told local authority bosses they expect the maximum possible 4.99% increase to be applied to council tax in April. The increases are likely to add about £100 to a typical band D council tax bill, adding to the financial pressure on families, with inflation currently at 4%. It comes as Sunak prepares to put cuts to income tax at the heart of the Tories’ re-election strategy, with a raft of measures expected to be announced in the spring budget, to be paid for by “difficult decisions” to limit spending on public services and welfare. Local government leaders and experts warned that by raising council tax, the burden of the financial crisis in councils was being shifted to the poorest households. David Phillips, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it would hurt the poorest households most because council tax forms a larger share of their monthly outgoings than that of a wealthier family. “Increasing council tax while cutting most direct taxes – for example, national insurance, income tax and especially capital gains tax and inheritance tax – would be regressive,” Phillips said. Last week Gove announced an injection of an extra £600m into local government funding in England to stave off the threat of a Commons rebellion by Tory MPs worried about cuts to services in their constituencies. He told MPs: “Taking into account this new funding, local government in England will see an increase in core spending power of up to £4.5bn next year, or 7.5% in cash terms, an above-inflation increase, rising from £60.2bn in 2023-24 to up to £64.7bn.” However, in details glossed over by the government, almost half of the £4.5bn boost is based on the assumption that every local authority in England applies the maximum allowable council tax rise. If it was frozen, the package would be worth a rise of about 4%, matching the current rate of inflation.  Roger Gough, the Tory leader of Kent county council, said: “That spending power means us taxing the residents of Kent more. Or at least the government’s expectations are based on that.” James Lewis, the Labour leader of Leeds city council, said: “People are paying more council tax each year and getting a lower level of service, as it stretches to cover reduced government grants.” He said the share of his city’s budget that was funded by Westminster had fallen from about 36% a decade ago to about 5%, after cuts worth £2.5bn in total. “But we’re still expected to cover that gap, largely through savings, council tax increases and money we make through fees and charges for services.”   Related: How a decade of austerity has squeezed council budgets in England   Figures from the Institute for Government show councils have raised 30% more from council tax in real terms since 2010, in an attempt to fill a gaping hole from cuts to grant funding of about 40% during the Tories’ first decade in power. Stuart Hoddinott, a senior researcher at the thinktank, said: “It’s just shifting it to another place. You’re replacing centralised taxation with localised taxation. It’s as much of a burden on individuals as a rise in income tax, it’s just one that’s attributed to councils as opposed to central government. [But] if it allows the chancellor to announce they can cut tax by X at the budget, I can see why that would be appealing.”  Ben Bradley, the Conservative MP who is also leader of Nottinghamshire county council, welcomed last week’s funding increase for councils, but said: “There’s almost no point chopping £100 off tax bills nationally if you’re adding on to it with council tax. There is support out there and polling that people are keen to see investment in public services as a priority. There is scope to do both.” Council tax increases are capped at 4.99% each year unless a local referendum approves a higher amount, which has never happened. Only one referendum has ever been held, in Bedfordshire in 2015, when a majority of residents voted against it. Several troubled councils have been granted bigger increases of up to 15% by Gove in response to “exceptional” financial circumstances, including Croydon, Thurrock and Woking. Others, including Birmingham and Somerset, are seeking approval for 10% increases. The rises come amid growing calls for changes to council tax, which remains based on 1991 property valuations despite a vast increase in house prices over the past three decades. Council tax was introduced in 1993 to replace the community charge, known as the poll tax. Last week the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), the group founded by George Osborne to promote economic growth in northern England, said changes to council tax could help address the worsening “emergency in local government” for those authorities in less affluent areas with the lowest tax bases. The NPP said a household living in a house in Hartlepool worth £150,000 was paying more than £200 a year more in council tax than someone in Westminster in a property worth £8m. A government spokesperson said: “Councils are responsible for their own finances and set council tax levels but we have been clear they should be mindful of cost of living pressures. We continue to protect taxpayers from excessive council tax increases through referendum principles.”"

        "content": "The Democratic Unionist party is to consider ending its two-year boycott of power-sharing in Northern Ireland at a meeting that could make or break Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s leadership. Donaldson will on Monday night brief the party’s 130-strong executive members about UK government proposals to address unionist concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements. He is under pressure from the British and Irish governments to endorse the proposals and recommend a restoration of the Stormont executive, putting him on a collision course with unionist hardliners who say that would weaken Northern Ireland’s position the UK. Donaldson is to unveil details of a deal negotiated with Rishi Sunak’s administration, which wants him to end an impasse that has paralysed Northern Ireland politics and raised doubts about the viability of devolution. The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 in protest at checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, leaving civil servants to run the region on a form of auto-pilot. A fiscal crisis and crumbling public services have led to mass strikes, with transport workers due to halt bus and train services again on Thursday. Dublin and London, as well as most other Northern Ireland parties and unions, want Stormont revived. However, factions within the DUP, some loyalists and the small Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party want the DUP to continue the boycott unless the so-called Irish Sea border is removed. Unverified leaks about the deal suggest Downing Street has offered to limit the UK’s active divergence from EU rules on traded goods when that would affect Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland stayed within the EU single market for goods after Brexit so the EU requires controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Another mooted change is renaming the green lane the UK internal market lane. The meeting of executive members may pit Donaldson supporters against rebels but leave Stormont’s fate unresolved. The BBC reported there was no planned meeting for party officers, who had the authority to sign off on a deal. In an impassioned speech at Westminster last week, Donaldson said he had received threats from fellow unionists but would not be bullied. The DUP reported the incidents to the police. The County Down Orange lodge, which includes former DUP politicians, urged Donaldson to hold out for full elimination of the sea border, which it warned could pave the way to Irish unity. A separate warning came in a paper jointly authored by the unionist and Brexiter advocates Lady Kate Hoey, Ben Habib, Jamie Bryson and Jim Allister. “The perversion and constitutional obscenity of a partitioning border in the Irish Sea would be given permanency through its acceptance by the DUP, if they return to Stormont now,” it said. Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said that if the DUP did not revive power-sharing London and Dublin needed to intervene. “People have been very patient, the time for action was long past,” she told RTÉ. “If they continue to delay and leave us in this limbo it’s time for both governments to step in.”"

        "author": "",
        "published_date": "2024-01-29T05:45:25+00:00",
        "content": "The former Conservative donor who chairs Iceland supermarket has publicly backed Keir Starmer to be the next prime minister, saying the Labour leader understands how the cost of living crisis has put an “unbearable strain” on families. Richard Walker, who quit the Tories last October after previously seeking to be a candidate, said he had reserved judgment on who to back at the next election but now believed that Labour and Starmer had a “credible programme” to improve the UK economy and people’s lives. Walker’s change in allegiance comes after Labour put huge effort into wooing business leaders and persuading them that the party would not implement anti-business policies. The party plans to hold a major business conference in central London, hosting leaders from companies including Google, Shell, AstraZeneca, Airbus and Goldman Sachs. More than 400 are expected to attend and the event sold out in four hours. Writing for the Guardian, Walker, the executive chair of Iceland, said Starmer had moved closer to the centre while Rishi Sunak’s party had gone in a different direction and caused a “total collapse in public confidence” in the government. He said he had met Starmer and that the Labour leader had demonstrated a “compassion and concern for the less fortunate” as well as an understanding of the cost of living crisis that had hurt his customers. Walker said he was particularly keen on change to regulation to allow promotions of and discounts on infant formula, which has soared in price during the cost of living crisis – a move that would overturn a ban put in place in order to avoid discouraging breastfeeding. The businessman highlighted Starmer’s leadership qualities, saying he had “demonstrated this in the way in which he has transformed his own party by ruthlessly excising the Corbynite extremism that made Labour unelectable in 2019”. Walker said he had not had a “radical change of heart” but that Starmer had “progressively moved towards the ground on which I have always stood, at the same time as the Conservatives have moved away from it”. “Indeed, the Tories’ abandonment of what I have always regarded as basic Conservative principles has fuelled my personal disenchantment,” he added. Walker said Labour’s missions were clear, while the Conservatives had presided over infighting, chaos and an “apparently endless churn of prime ministers, chancellors and secretaries of state”. He said Rachel Reeves was a chancellor in waiting who understood the critical importance of wealth creation and that he believed the party would remove barriers in the planning system, as well as “breathing new life into our wearied high streets”. Walker, who stressed that Iceland as a business was apolitical, said he did not agree with everything that Labour proposed, and that he would not became a party member. He is not understood to be planning to donate to the party. However, he said he would support Labour at the next election and hoped that it would “deliver the majority they will need to begin delivering their recovery programme for the UK”. Other business leaders are likely to follow Walker in switching allegiance to Labour as the election draws closer. Starmer’s party is still leading the polls by a large margin. Ahead of Monday’s business summit, Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, pledged to make it an annual event and promised to end the “VIP lanes” for contracts that gave preference to bidders with links to government figures during the pandemic. “Labour is the party of business,” he said. “There will be no back doors or special access for donors under a Labour government. The public and honest businesses have had enough of Conservative sleaze and scandal. Labour will bring integrity back to how the government and business works together to solve the big challenges in our country. We will always treat taxpayer money with the same respect a businesses treats customers’ money.” Earlier on Sunday, Reynolds stressed that the party’s commitment to increasing spending on green projects to £28bn by the middle of a parliament was not “the holy grail”, following speculation that it could be dropped after the budget. He told Times Radio: “How much you can spend is determined by the health of the economy, and for us, our fiscal rules. We want to see UK government debt falling at the end of a parliament. I don’t want to be talking about a sum of money as being the holy grail in terms of investments. “It’s about, over time, getting to that level of ambition, whilst making clear that how much you can spend, how much you can invest, is governed by your fiscal rules. It is opposition within the envelope of what the government are doing, because that’s your starting point. That is just the reality of opposition.”"

        "content": "Betty Boothroyd wanted to use her valedictory speech in the House of Lords to criticise prime ministers for giving too many peerages to friends and those with “fat bank accounts” who had bankrolled the party in power. The former speaker of the House of Commons planned her final speech, in which she also said there was no longer a place for hereditary peers, but was too ill to deliver it. Lady Boothroyd, who died last February, had agreed the final draft and her former secretary, Sir Nicholas Bevan, has now arranged for it to be published. In a text of the speech reported by the Daily Telegraph, Boothroyd wrote: “Successive prime ministers have attached importance to their power of patronage; in my view this should be exercised far less generously than has tended to be the case in the recent past.   Related: Lady Boothroyd obituary   “Of course, prime ministers should be permitted to make appointments on leaving office, but they should be limited in their proposals and they should not include those who are simply friends or have no other qualifications than having fat bank accounts from which they have bankrolled the party in power.” The former Labour MP also wrote she did not “see a role any longer for members who are here simply as a result of their heredity”, calling the size of the Lords, with more than 800 members, “absurd”. “Not only do we not need so many members to carry out our role, but our size positively militates against effectiveness and efficiency and is unnecessarily expensive,” she said. She also called for all appointments to the House of Lords to be subject to the agreement of the Appointments Commission. “The commission’s powers should not simply be advisory, but should be put on a statutory basis,” she wrote. “Nobody should become a member of this House if a statutory Appointments Commission has reservations about their suitability.” The existence of Boothroyd’s final speech was made known at her memorial at Westminster Abbey earlier this month. According to Bevan, the final version, published on Monday in the House magazine, was agreed in 2022, a few months before her death at the age of 93. Boothroyd became the 27th woman elected to parliament when she won the seat of West Bromwich in May 1973, and went on to become the first female speaker of the House. Reflecting on her time in politics, she wrote: “My Lords, parliamentary politics for me has never been just a career; it has been my life and, like miners’ coal dust, it cannot be scrubbed out from under one’s fingernails.”"

        "content": "The Labour MP Kate Osamor has had the whip suspended while she is investigated for saying Gaza should be remembered as a genocide on Holocaust Memorial Day. The MP for Edmonton in north London is due to meet party whips on Monday after issuing an apology over the message she sent on the eve of the day marking the murder of 6 million Jews during the second world war. Osamor had distributed the message to her party members, saying Holocaust Memorial Day should be observed, but other genocides should also be remembered – listing Gaza as one of them. The former shadow development secretary, who served in Jeremy Corbyn’s top team, shared a photograph of herself signing the Westminster remembrance book of the Holocaust Educational Trust.   Related: Angela Rayner: Tories’ council fund is cynical pre-election sticking plaster   She also wrote that there was an ‘“international duty” to remember the victims of the Holocaust, as well as “more recent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and now Gaza”. Osamor later tweeted: “Holocaust Memorial Day is a day to remember the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and the genocides that have occurred since. I apologise for any offence caused by my reference to the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Gaza as part of that period of remembrance.” Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, told Sky News that Osamor had met the chief whip to discuss her comments and was due to meet officials again this week. “What is happening in Gaza is clearly a humanitarian catastrophe that is recognised,” he said. “But there are specific reasons why the Holocaust is considered as it is. It’s important on Holocaust Remembrance Day to remember that. “And I understand Kate has apologised. There’s been a conversation with the chief whip. There’ll be further conversations next week, but of course we take anything in this space extremely seriously.” Asked if Osamor was likely to be disciplined, Reynolds added: “There will be those conversations, and I can tell you that they have already been scheduled for the week ahead. Of course, whenever we have a situation like this, we take it extremely seriously.” Starmer has supported Israel’s “right to defend itself” in Gaza against Hamas, but more recently called for a sustainable ceasefire and hit out at the “intolerable” casualties. His position has caused tensions within Labour. Many in the party have pressed him to be more critical of Israel’s military action, which has caused an estimated 24,000 deaths. Momentum, the pressure group on the left of Labour, said it was an “outrageous decision [that] further damages Labour’s reputation for anti-racism under Keir Starmer, and should be immediately reversed”."

        "content": "Labour has criticised “dither and delay” from the government over a decision on a proposed takeover of the UK’s largest semiconductor facility by a US company, warning that it could lead to further job cuts at the Welsh factory. The fate of Newport Wafer Fab in south Wales has been unclear for nearly two years since the UK government first indicated it had concerns over a 2021 takeover by the Chinese-owned Nexperia firm. The national security concerns related to the ownership of semiconductor technology by a company with links to China. The government in November 2022 ordered Nexperia to sell the factory, raising questions over its future. About 100 of 550 workers were made redundant or left in the intervening period; this included 60 forced redundancies at the end of last year. The American semiconductor company Vishay Intertechnology eventually agreed to buy the factory in November 2023 for $177m, and the company is planning $1.2bn in global investments, some of which could benefit Newport. The deal was welcomed at the time by the Welsh Labour government, but ministers in Westminster have not given the go-ahead for the takeover nearly three months later. Jo Stevens, the shadow secretary of state for Wales, has written to the secretary of state for Wales, David TC Davies, criticising the government for “dragging its feet” in deciding whether the proposed takeover by Vishay can go ahead. The letter, seen by the Guardian, argues that the delay has left workers in “damaging limbo which could cost further investment and jobs”, and adds that some redundancies have been made during the period of “dither and delay”. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister and Cabinet Office secretary, has final say over approval of takeovers that fall within national security rules. On the government’s website, Dowden boasts that officials can “clear most cases within a prompt, business-friendly, 30 working days”. The situation comes at a sensitive time, as 2,800 workers at the Port Talbot steelworks, further west along the coast, face the prospect of losing their jobs with the imminent closure of its two blast furnaces. Newport Wafer Fab does not employ as many people as the steelworks but the company is one of the few UK companies with the ability to make semiconductors. The factory makes chips for controlling power in devices ranging from vacuum cleaners to Jaguar and Land Rover cars, although it does not make the smallest, most cutting-edge, chips that are most strategically valued – a fact that some people have argued diminishes any national security concerns. Mary Curtis, a programme manager at Newport Wafer Fab, said all development work at the site had stopped and it could not take new orders because of the delays, which had also affected workers. “Since November 2022 we’ve been faced with a very uncertain, precarious, time,” she said. “In terms of national security there shouldn’t be any cause for concern. We can’t see what’s causing the delay. The employees are struggling with it, so are Vishay and Nexperia.” Labour argued in the letter to Davies that Vishay was “based in the US, a close ally and strategic military partner”. A UK government spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring that the UK semiconductor industry continues to grow and thrive across the UK, including in South Wales. “Our ambitious semiconductor strategy, which was published earlier this year, is providing investment of up to £1bn in the sector over the next decade.” Vishay declined to comment."

        "content": "Kemi Badenoch has hit out at Conservative plotters for “stirring” by suggesting she could replace Rishi Sunak, saying prime ministers “cannot be treated as disposable”. The business secretary, who consistently comes out as the favourite cabinet minister in polls of Tory members, said it would be wrong to get rid of Sunak on the basis of unpopularity or poor polling. Asked on Sky’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme about reports of Tory MPs seeking to replaced Sunak as leader and those calling for her to be his replacement, she said: “They need to stop messing around and get behind the leader. “The fact of the matter is most people in the country are not interested in all of this Westminster tittle-tattle. Quite frankly, the people who keep putting my name in there are not my friends. They don’t care about me. They don’t care about my family or what this would entail. They are just stirring. “We have 350 MPs, this is a small number of people who are doing this. The vast majority of Conservative MPs support the prime minister.” Badenoch said her own popularity with Conservative members was irrelevant. “This is not a popularity contest. This is about running the country. We can’t just keep treating prime ministers as if they are disposable. ‘Oh, the polls aren’t doing so well, so let’s toss someone else and find another person’ – that’s quite wrong.” She added: “We should not be trying to drag out prime ministers on the basis of a popularity contest and polling on websites.” She later told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg there was too much focus on personality in politics. “If we stick with [Sunak’s] plan we will be able to solve all the problems that people are worried about,” she said. When asked about the former cabinet minister Simon Clarke, who this week called for Sunak to resign, Badenoch said he should have aired his opinions privately within the Conservative party. She said she was “extremely frustrated” by the plotting of those trying to get rid of Sunak. Asked whether she denied having anything to do with the plotting, Badenoch said: “Apart from calling Simon to tell him to stop what he was doing, absolutely. It’s all anonymous briefings. Who are these people? My friends would never do that.” Asked whether she still had ambitions to lead the party, the cabinet minister did not rule out another run at the top job, saying: “You never really know until you are in the moment”. Senior Conservative figures have been scrambling to figure out who is behind plotting against Sunak, after a mysterious group called the Conservative Britain Alliance funded a £40,000 poll, fronted by the Tory peer David Frost in the Telegraph, that predicted a Labour landslide in the next election. It has since emerged that a group of former Tory aides are suspected of working on a plot to replace the prime minister. One of them has been revealed as Will Dry, a former No 10 adviser who devised the YouGov polling questions."

        "content": "When Keir Starmer gathered with a small team of aides, first thing on Wednesday, to discuss lines of attack for prime minister’s questions, the plan fell into place with relative ease. Starmer, his officials say, generally arrives at his office in parliament early and is “incredibly well informed about what has been in all the papers and the media” but on this occasion no one had had to search too far for material. The best line – from Labour’s point of view – was staring Starmer and his team in the face. Late the previous evening, news had broken on social media that the Tory MP and ex-cabinet minister Simon Clarke had written a piece for Wednesday’s Daily Telegraph calling for Rishi Sunak to be ousted. If he were to lead the Conservatives into a general election, Clarke wrote, “extinction” was “a very real possibility” for his party. So extreme was the language that it read like a Labour critique of the prime minster. “He does not get what Britain needs and he is not listening to what the British people want,” said Clarke. The possibilities for the opposition leader were endless, and at the meeting broad lines were agreed. Starmer could draw obvious contrasts between divided Tories fighting each other and losing faith in their leader, and a united Labour party focused on getting ready to take over. Unsurprisingly, Starmer landed some decent blows just after midday, the best of which was when he surprised his staff by ad-libbing his own version of Tony Blair’s lethal attack on John Major in 1995 (“I lead my party. He follows his”), telling Sunak: “I have changed my party. He is bullied by his.” For Labour, though, it was about more than Starmer putting on a good show at the dispatch box and the theatre of one day’s PMQs. The messages fitted well into the broader theme of a Labour party seriously, and painstakingly, getting ready for its chance to govern and change the country, against a divided and exhausted Conservative party which cannot focus on the nation’s needs as it panics and tears itself to pieces over the ever more likely prospect of crushing defeat. For Clarke, however, the reaction to his piece among fellow Conservatives was not as he had hoped. Even by the standards of many of his friends on the party’s right, his critique seemed wild. It was not the moment, MPs said, ahead of difficult byelections in February and local elections in May. Tory WhatsApp groups erupted with rage and frustration, describing Clarke variously as self-indulgent, delusional or, more straightforwardly, “a tosser”. Some pointed to the reaction of Priti Patel – a potential rightwing leadership candidate in the event of a Tory election loss – as being the most significant one. She quickly backed Sunak and said that Clarke – who had been at Stamford Bridge watching his team, Middlesbrough, being thrashed 6-1 by Chelsea in the Carabao Cup when news about his piece first surfaced – was engaging in “facile and divisive self-indulgence”. Liz Truss, a former ally of Clarke, had been at a private members’ club in London with a group of political friends when she heard of the “one-man coup” and is said to have been as shocked as everyone else. By Wednesday morning, Tory ministers felt secure enough to be making jokes about the ostracisation of the 6ft 7in Sir Simon. As one put it, Sunak had survived “the knife of the long knight”. Another minister mocked the attention the “plot” had been given. “Reading some stuff, it’s as if there’s this great cell set somewhere in west London, where they’re working out who’s going to emerge after the byelection or local elections,” the minister said. “I don’t see it. There’s people who hate Rishi because they love Boris and they think that he’s rich. They’re just stupid, like the people who did the same in the run-up to [the election in] 1997. I would have thought the reaction to Simon Clarke would give a lot of pause for thought.” But the episode had opened still more Tory divisions, and raised some serious questions. Some close to Sunak asked why he was not being more ruthless in dealing with rebels such as Clarke and the Tories who had voted against his Rwanda bill the week before. “We should just take the whip off them,” said one. “Because that would be the strongest signal that if you do this, you’re out. Labour has done this all the time. Once you start doing that, people will know that they haven’t got a chance to come back. That will be it.” What was worrying loyal Tories most was that, even if Clarke did misfire and go off on his own, there were indications that some form of coordination was taking place among enemies of the prime minister in the broader sense. Clarke’s broadside had come after a mystery donor had funded a huge opinion poll pointing to a Labour landslide, the results of which had been published in the Daily Telegraph. The poll had been funded through a new group called the Conservative Britain Alliance; Boris Johnson’s ally Lord Frost has since emerged as its frontman. One Tory grandee noted scornfully: “Conservative British Alliance. CBA. Youth slang for Can’t be Arsed. Frost razor sharp!” On top of all that, there were concerns that the Telegraph, the Tory party’s publication of choice, had been seemingly willing to promote such anti-Sunak material. Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow ministers, MPs, officials and party workers are being called, in no uncertain terms, into line. While the Tories face their own existential questions and struggle to hang together, team Starmer is imposing a level of discipline and message control to rival that of New Labour in the run-up to 1997. Starmer’s head of campaigns, Morgan McSweeney, is telling everyone to plan for a general election on 2 May. He seems to think the Tories may still go early, but this is also a way to ensure everyone is ready. The message is getting through. One senior official said: “We have to prepare for May because we have no choice. And that means everything has to be ready to go from mid-March – the budget, money, candidates, manifesto.” Team Starmer also points to other factors as evidence that May is in play: for example, the Tories having chosen 4 March as the date of the budget – and their talk of tax cuts – as well as their rising spending on online ads and the speeding-up of Conservative candidate selections. Everything is cranking into gear. Talks between shadow ministers and civil servants in each government department will begin between now and Easter in preparation for a potential transition. Members of the shadow cabinet have been told to submit their plans for inclusion in Labour’s election manifesto by 8 February, so they can be subjected to intense “stress testing” and be thoroughly “bomb-proofed”. The process is multilayered. Among the officials at the heart of it all are Rav Athwal, a former Treasury official and economist who is now in charge of drawing up the manifesto (and checking the sums add up), and Sue Gray, the former senior civil servant working as Starmer’s chief of staff – one of whose roles is to tell everyone, from her vast experience of government, what is feasible and deliverable once in power. The shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth has been given the key role of assessing the political attacks that other parties might launch on each policy in a campaign, and how to defend them. Recently, Ashworth told the shadow cabinet that in the otherwise hugely successful 1997 campaign Labour lost vital time because it found itself under pressure over a forgotten pledge to privatise air traffic control that had been made at a party conference then never developed afterwards. “It’s that kind of mistake we have to avoid,” said a source. The shadow leader of the House, Lucy Powell, is chairing a special committee looking at what legislation can be included in a king’s speech that will have to be delivered with a few weeks of any Labour victory. Her counterpart in the Lords, Angela Smith, the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, and Gray are on this legislation committee, as well as the chief whips in the Commons and Lords. Another source said: “If we win, we have to have bills ready to go within a few weeks of coming in. There will be literally no time to waste. We have to hit the ground running. Lucy is going round saying we can’t leave it till after the election and then say: ‘Oh shit, we haven’t got anything’.” Before Christmas, the party moved into a new, open-plan headquarters in Southwark. There insiders say they have noticed the formation of a “top table” group who meet regularly and operate on a “hotdesk” basis. They include the likes of Athwal, Gray, shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, McSweeney, and McSweeney’s deputy Marianna McFadden. Katie Martin, chief of staff to shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, is also involved. Some in senior positions in the Labour party are concerned that the operation is too controlled, meaning people are afraid to speak with confidence about ideas. Others worry that there is a lack of political thinking going on about what Labour’s story will be if and when it wins. “We are going to be an unpopular government. There is a lot of ‘day one’ work going on – on legislation we are getting going. But who is doing the political work? Who is there thinking about what the message will be when we are there? What we are there for? I don’t see that work going on.” In answer to those who claim they are too cautious and controlling, team Starmer says that in a world where trust in politics and politicians has been eroded, Labour has to reassure to be credible, rather than talk and promise too big. “We have to tell a story that the Tories have destroyed the country but our offer also has to have reassurance that we will deliver at its heart. The hope we offer has to be based on reassurance,” says one key aide. Discipline is regularly coupled with cautionary talks from the Labour pollster Deborah Mattinson about the electoral mountain the party has to climb. “We know we need a 12.7% swing, and in 1997 we got a 10.6% swing – so we need a 20% bigger swing than in ’97. No one is getting overexcited. It is not electorally straightforward,” said another senior party figure. As Labour readies itself – not without its own internal worries, tensions and inevitable paranoia after four consecutive election losses – a low-key war of attrition against Sunak rumbles on. Truss supporters are planning something resembling a relaunch next month with a new grouping they are calling “Popular Conservatism”, or “PopCon” for short. Some Tory MPs are nervous after the Clarke intervention, even though it fizzled out before it could become a crisis. “Obviously there is a slight concern that we’ll look back and think these were the very first rumblings,” said one loyalist. “But I think in real life, there just aren’t enough months to coalesce around someone else – so let’s just not be silly.” Many Tories are simply desperate to start testing Starmer – frustrated in the belief that if they can only string together a few weeks of unity, scrutiny will begin to undo the Labour leader’s cautious strategy. “I have not met a single person who has ever said to me, ‘I’m excited to be voting for Keir Starmer’s Labour party,” said one MP. “We should be sitting here saying we can’t believe our luck that he is our opponent.” With perfect timing, Tory MPs had to gather together on Wednesday evening for a “family photo” to mark the centenary of the 1922 Committee – essentially the trade union of Tory MPs. Clarke was a notable absentee. Yet the latest bout of ill-discipline left one of those lining up shoulder-to-shoulder with colleagues having a grim flash of the future. “I’m not sure, if we do a version this time next year, that there’ll be quite so many people,” the MP said."

        "content": "The government is considering handing workers another tax cut with a further reduction in national insurance, amid desperate attempts to move on from a campaign to destabilise Rishi Sunak by the Tory right. With frustration within the cabinet that the Conservative party has been unable to free itself from internal warring over Sunak’s immigration plans and leadership, the prime minister and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, are focusing on the tax cuts that will frame their election pitch. Treasury officials are already exploring options for tax cuts in March’s budget, one of the few setpiece events capable of closing Labour’s stubbornly large poll lead. It is understood that Hunt is again keen to focus tax cuts on “rewarding work and growing the economy”, a priority that led him to cut national insurance from 12% to 10% in last year’s autumn statement. The move saved the average worker £450 a year, but cost about £9bn a year to deliver. Budget preparations will step up a gear on Tuesday, when the chancellor receives initial economic projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). That will give his team a sense of giveaways they can afford. Government figures pointed to a further cut to employee national insurance and Hunt is said to see national insurance as a “jobs tax” that could be holding back growth. “National insurance is the top pick,” said one insider. “You can do it immediately. Second, it excludes pensioners, who are already protected thanks to the state pension triple lock [which protects its value]. Third, it goes to those that are working, so it fits our narrative.” Hunt is also considering an extension of child benefit to wealthier families. Currently, child benefit begins to be withdrawn from those who earn £50,000 a year. People who earn £60,000 a year lose it entirely. The move could stabilise the party in so-called “blue wall” seats – liberal, pro-Remain areas where they are under threat from the Lib Dems and Labour. The budget has taken on even more significance since the former cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke broke cover last week to warn his party would face a “massacre” on polling day unless it replaced Sunak. While Clarke struck an isolated figure following his intervention, Sunak’s detractors are planning to use what are likely to be poor byelection results next month to further derail him. While Clarke’s attempted putsch earned widespread scorn from fellow MPs, there is nervousness among Sunak’s allies and frustration that infighting continues to choke off any recovery in public support for the party. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that Labour continues to enjoy a strong lead. Labour has 42% of the vote, with the Tories on 27% and the Lib Dems and Reform level on 10% each. Such is the frustration that some of Sunak’s allies want him to be ruthless and remove the whip from Clarke and others who attempt to destabilise the party just months from the election. “We should just take the whip off them,” said one. “Because that would be the strongest signal that if you do this, you’re out. Labour has done this all the time. Once you start doing that, people will know that they haven’t got a chance to come back. That will be it.” Another said that removing the whip from the rebels was “not in Rishi’s character”, but that the most vociferous critics had been warned they were “getting very, very close” to having the whip removed. “Those who voted against the government [on its Rwanda plan] are in the last chance saloon,” said a senior Tory. Others want Hunt to tighten the government’s fiscal rules, in a move designed to push scrutiny on Labour’s commitment to eventually invest £28bn in its green plans. The commitment is seen as the largest hostage to fortune remaining in Labour’s programme. However, it is understood Hunt has rejected any plan to alter the rules again before the election. While the Clarke intervention misfired, there are concerns that there will be an attritional campaign against Sunak. One veteran MP said it was being waged by a small group of disaffected figures on the right who have “a pathological hatred of the Tory party, other than the one led by Boris Johnson”. Sunak allies have been trying to unmask the donors who funded the mysterious Conservative Britain Alliance, which commissioned a mega poll earlier this month that pointed to a Labour landslide. The poll was used by Lord Frost, the pro-Johnson former Brexit minister, to argue that the party must shift to the right. There is also an expectation that the Conservatives will lose both byelections in Kingswood and Wellingborough, the latter previously regarded as a safe seat. Even after the budget in March, Sunak will have to endure local elections soon after that are also likely to deliver a bruising result."

        "content": "Jeremy Hunt was dealt a poor hand when he entered No 11 in October 2022. The public finances were in a mess after Liz Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, had splurged £45bn on tax cuts in a mini-budget that was considered so reckless it spooked financial markets. Interest rates spiralled higher, leaving Hunt to wrestle with rising debt-financing costs at a time when double-digit inflation was already pushing up the cost of providing government services. Since then, he has steadied the ship. But now there are demands for tax cuts – not least from the prime minister – when Hunt delivers his second budget to parliament in March, to bolster the party’s standing ahead of an expected general election. On what basis are tax cuts affordable – and where will Hunt’s strategy leave Labour’s Rachel Reeves, should she become chancellor? Here we discuss the issues. How much money does the government spend? Public expenditure rocketed during the pandemic and the first year of the Ukraine war, far outpacing government income. In the year to April 2024, spending is expected to hit £1.222tn, up £71bn from £1.15tn in the previous financial year. This will leave a £124bn shortfall on an expected income of £1.098tn, according to projections last November put together by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury’s independent forecaster. What are the government’s spending rules? There is only one constraint on Hunt’s spending. He has pledged to bring down the overall level of debt as a proportion of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), in the fifth year of the OBR’s five-year forecast. The debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 99.6% after a brief rise above 100% last year, leaving both the UK’s total accumulated debt and GDP at almost the same level of £2.6tn. The OBR must benchmark its forecasts of government income and spending against this rule. Such is the (modest) improvement in the economic outlook, the OBR is expected to hand Hunt £20bn more to play with than it forecast at the time of last November’s autumn statement. The £20bn will be his fiscal headroom. Why does Hunt have headroom to spend more? The OBR’s forecast for the deficit, equivalent to 4.5% of GDP, is now expected to be too gloomy after the need for fuel subsidies ebbed away faster than had previously been foreseen. There are many moving parts in the government budget, but one significant factor is the precipitous fall in inflation last year, which will mean the Bank of England can cut interest rates at a faster pace over the next couple of years, bringing down debt interest bills more quickly than expected. Debt interest has risen from about 1.5% of government spending to almost 10% in recent years, so any reduction will be welcomed by the chancellor. Much of the UK’s debt is also tied to index-linked bonds and lower inflation will bring about a cut in the monthly payments needed to finance them. Do the chancellor’s spending plans make sense? Last week, the head of the OBR, Richard Hughes, said forecasts of government spending over five-year periods had often been described as fiction, adding that he found it difficult to argue with that portrayal. According to official projections, the government spending deficit this year of 4.5% of GDP is due to fall to 2.7% in 2025 and to 1.1% in 2028-29. However, these figures are based on scant information from Whitehall departments; Hunt has handed the OBR the equivalent of one side of A4 paper in response to the OBR’s request for his five-year spending plans. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said Hunt’s refusal to give any details about Whitehall spending meant there was a “fiscal fiction”. She said commitments to increase spending on health, education, defence and international development would mean a 2.3% cut in unprotected departments’ budgets, without any clue about what that would look like. What can we expect from Labour? The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said she will adopt Hunt’s fiscal rule. That will limit her ability to spend and borrow unless she modifies the commitment once in office.  Many of Labour’s pledges will be based on reorganisations and efficiency drives to release cash for investment, especially in high-spending areas such as welfare and the NHS. But promises to maintain the pension triple lock will mean retirement payments will account for a higher proportion of spending. Why will Labour play the Conservatives’ game? After the Corbyn years, Keir Starmer is keen to establish Labour’s credentials with the public as a safe pair of hands when dealing with taxpayer cash. While the polls have Labour far ahead, Starmer and Reeves believe the public need to be reassured they will restrict borrowing to the same level as the Tories have promised. More than that, they fear that a radical plan to overhaul the economy would spark the same reaction from the financial markets that wrecked Truss’s administration. Does Labour have any wriggle room? There will be many calls on Labour to increase spending if they get into office. But it won’t be easy. The Tories will have committed every spare pound to tax cuts – a policy that will be politically difficult to unwind – and left plenty of ticking “debt bombs” behind. Reeves expects Hunt’s scorched-earth policy will leave the financial cupboard bare – and, worse, dump large unaccounted debts in her lap, such as defence budget overspends, student loan repayment shortfalls, bankrupt local authorities and backlogs of NHS operations. A policy of higher borrowing may be possible but will need to be carefully calibrated to mollify financial markets, which will want to see that the extra spending can be shown to improve the UK’s economic productivity and with that, its ability to repay debt."

        "content": "More than twice as many voters believe a Labour government would be better for housing than the Tories, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The survey shows Labour is well ahead of the Conservatives on most issues including the economy, health, education, the environment, immigration and crime, and level pegging on ones it has traditionally lagged way behind on, including defence. But its lead on housing and house prices will be particularly encouraging to Labour strategists who want it to be seen as the best party for housing provision and a healthy housing market. At his party’s annual conference last October Keir Starmer pledged to get Britain building again – starting with one and a half million new homes across the country within five years of a Labour government. Labour has promised to shake up the planning system to allow for more housebuilding, including the creation of a new generation of new towns if it wins the next election, as well as more green investment in onshore windfarms. When Opinium asked voters which party they thought would be best for “housing/house prices”, 34% chose a Labour government under Starmer, against just 16% who chose the Tories under Rishi Sunak. On the economy overall, 32% chose Labour, against 26% for the Tories. On immigration 30% chose Labour and 22% the Tories. On defence, traditionally one of the Tories’ strongest suits and Labour’s weakest, the parties are equal on 26% each. On fighting terrorism the Tories are just one point ahead of Labour on 25%. Overall Labour has increased its lead over the Tories by two points over the past two weeks. Labour is on 42% (up 2 points) with the Tories unchanged on 27%. Adam Drummond, head of political and social research at Opinium, said: “Worrying for the Tories is the lack of indication, as we enter an election year, that they can restore public confidence in their handling of issues. Labour continues to hold a lead on being best placed to handle all of the top five issues the public think the country is facing.”"

        "content": "David Cameron’s activities at the scandal-hit Greensill Capital finance company are a “matter of interest” in a wider investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, the Guardian understands. The SFO, which investigates and prosecutes fraud, bribery and corruption in the UK, has questioned interview subjects about the UK foreign secretary’s involvement with the now-defunct company, sources claim. The Guardian understands that Cameron’s activities have been discussed in sensitive interviews with witnesses in the long-running SFO investigation. A spokesperson for Cameron declined to answer specific questions about the investigation and his involvement with Greensill, but said that the foreign secretary had not personally had “any contact” with the SFO. Senior figures who worked at Greensill have been questioned as part of the SFO’s broader inquiry into “suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering” at companies within the Gupta Family Group Alliance (GFG) steel, energy and commodities empire, an investigation announced in 2021. GFG, owned by the steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Greensill was the main financial backer of the loose industrial grouping of energy, steel and commodities assets founded by Gupta. Witnesses have been questioned on the role Cameron played in promoting Greensill to investors and his engagement with and promotion of GFG, the Guardian understands. Greensill specialised in supply chain finance, a way of advancing cash to companies, and raised huge sums from banks including Credit Suisse before collapsing in 2021. The SFO said it could not comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, which is also examining GFG’s “financing arrangements with Greensill Capital”, which employed Cameron between 2018 and 2021. The finance company’s founder, Lex Greensill, a banker with farming roots in rural Australia, was given access to the heart of government during Cameron’s tenure at No 10. In 2012, Greensill shared business cards showing that he had an official No 10 email address and was working under the title “senior adviser” in the prime minister’s office. Greensill then hired the former prime minister as an adviser in 2018.Cameron was widely criticised for using contacts garnered while prime minister to personally lobby politicians and senior civil servants on behalf of Greensill when he worked for it. He sent WhatsApp messages to the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and text messages to a former top Treasury civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, during the height of the Covid pandemic. The foreign secretary’s lobbying showed a “significant lack of judgment”, according to a parliamentary inquiry by the Treasury committee in 2021. Cameron, who rejoined the government and was handed a peerage late last year, has previously said he played “no role in the decisions to extend credit, or the terms on which such credit was extended, to GFG or any other customer”. During their inquiry into the scandal, MPs on the Treasury committee said: “We question Cameron’s judgment in relation to his lobbying on behalf of Greensill.” They added: “Cameron appears to have relied heavily on the board of Greensill as a guarantee of its propriety and financial health, when arguably he should have taken a broader and more enquiring assessment of the business. There were signals available to Cameron at the time when he was lobbying the Treasury and others which might have led him to a more restrained approach.” His lobbying efforts, which included directly approaching senior figures at the Bank of England as well as in Whitehall and Westminster, emphasised the need to support British industrial jobs, noting Greensill’s backing for GFG. Greensill and its backing for GFG has been subject to regulatory and potentially criminal inquiries in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Greensill told British MPs in 2021: “At no point would my firm have engaged in financing receivables that we knew to be fraudulent.” He declined to comment on GFG specifically, although Cameron has called GFG and Greensill relationship “symbiotic”. A spokesperson for the foreign minister said: “Lord Cameron has not had any contact with the SFO.” The Labour party called on Cameron in December to reveal the full extent of dealings with Gupta. Nick Smith, the shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, has written to Cameron to ask him to share all correspondence and documents linked to the Greensill/GFG relationship and provide a full account to parliament of what he shared about the two organisations with Sir Laurie Magnus, the prime minister’s ethics adviser, upon his appointment as foreign secretary.

        "published_date": "2024-01-26T22:30:18+00:00",
        "content": "Labour has pledged to reform the rules surrounding ministerial redundancy payments after it emerged that the high turnover of cabinet ministers under the past three prime ministers generated a severance bill worth more than £930,000 in the last financial year. Since 1991, sacked ministers under the age of 65 have been able to claim thousands of pounds in redundancy pay as long as they have been out of a ministerial post for at least three weeks. The receive the payments irrespective of how long they have stayed in their latest post, or the circumstances under which they left. Keir Starmer’s party has said it would introduce three changes to the rules. Labour believes it could make savings every financial year of more than 40% if it ensures ministers receive only a quarter of their actual earnings over the last 12 months as a minister, instead of their final annual salary, minus any period covered by a previous severance entitlement. The party would also ensure that the relevant amount would be taken back from any MP who returns to a ministerial position while still receiving a payout from a previous appointment, to stop ministers receiving a full three-month payout even if they return to the frontbench during that period. Finally, any minister who left a job while under investigation for allegations of misconduct or breaches of the ministerial code would have their severance suspended and quashed entirely if the allegations were upheld, bringing their treatment into line with the rules for civil servants and special advisers. If Labour’s rules were enforced over the last financial year, the party says only 76 payments would have been handed out, instead of 98. The severance bill of the last financial year could have been slashed by more than 40%, from £933,086 to £555,093. Chris Pincher and Peter Bone received severance payments despite being investigated for misconduct. Pincher quit in 2022 after allegations of groping and was handed £7,920 on leaving his deputy chief whip role. Bone was given £5,593 after he stepped down when voters in his constituency chose to trigger a byelection following a finding by the parliamentary watchdog that he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. The former Wellingborough MP was one of five frontbenchers handed payouts in error, as he is six years over the age limit. If the age limit was properly enforced by the Conservatives, Nadine Dorries would not have received £16,876, Deborah Stedman-Scott would not have received £17,742, and both Sir David Evennett and Maggie Throup would not have been handed £10,072. Rehman Chishti, who spent just two months as a Foreign Office minister in the late stages of Boris Johnson’s premiership (including two days as a candidate for the Tory leadership), would have had his payout cut from £5,593 to £936 under Labour’s rules. Brandon Lewis, who received two payments totalling £33,572 in just four months after leaving his jobs as Northern Ireland secretary in July 2022 and justice secretary 16 weeks later, would have had his entitlement cut to £13,594. Alec Shelbrooke, Jackie Doyle-Price and Rob Butler, who had short spells on the frontbench under Liz Truss and left with severance payments totalling £21,433 plus a knighthood, a damehood and an OBE respectively, would have had their payouts reduced to a total of £2,682. Jonathan Ashworth MP, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “We saw individuals who were never fit for ministerial office in the first place being forced to quit after their shameful conduct was exposed but still walking away with a payout from the taxpayer.“Under the current rules, every single one of those Tory ministers was legally entitled to three months of severance at their final-salary level, no matter how long they had been in post, no matter the circumstances of their departure, and – in most cases – no matter how quickly they returned to the frontbench. These are the glaring loopholes that Labour’s proposed reforms will seek to close.”"

        "content": "Conservative donors have been rushing to deny funding polling for a group working to oust Rishi Sunak, as David Frost was warned he could lose the whip if rival party backers were involved. Senior Tory figures are scrambling to figure out the mystery donors behind the Conservative Britain Alliance, which funded a £40,000 poll, fronted by Lord Frost in the Telegraph, that predicted a Labour landslide. Afterwards, Simon Clarke, a Conservative MP, publicly called for a change of leadership, and it has since emerged that a group of former Tory aides are suspected of working on a plot to replace the prime minister. One of them has been revealed as Will Dry, a former No 10 adviser, who devised the YouGov polling questions. Donors close to Boris Johnson, including Anthony Bamford and Peter Cruddas, as well as a spokesperson for Paul Marshall, the hedge fund boss and political donor behind GB News, said they had no involvement in the polling and group behind it. An aide for Alexander Temerko, who this month gave £5,000 to Clarke, said he had no links to the polling or the Conservative Britain Alliance. With No 10 taking the plot seriously, Frost was warned by Nicholas True, the Conservative whip in the Lords, that he could lose his party affiliation if the donors behind the Conservative Britain Alliance have given money to Nigel Farage’s Reform party. Frost is believed to have said that he did not think Reform figures were involved but refused to give names of the donors behind the mysterious group. There are several big donors who have given to Reform and the Conservatives who this would eliminate, including Jeremy Hosking, who also gives to Laurence Fox’s Reclaim. Hosking said he was not making any comment when asked if was involved in the Conservative Britain Alliance or the funding of the poll.  Other Tory and Reform donors include Christopher Harborne, who donated £1m to Boris Johnson’s office, and Terence Mordaunt, who gave to the leadership campaigns of Suella Braverman and Penny Mordaunt. Meanwhile, senior government figures are concerned that aides working with the anti-Sunak rebels are attending meetings in parliament on visitors’ passes to avoid having to declare their funders. At least two former political advisers have been seen at meetings with rebel MPs wearing visitors’ passes. These are meant to be used only by tourists visiting the parliamentary estate and not for work purposes. One Tory source said: “The suspicion is they’re avoiding a pass so as not to declare their donors – who may be the same who are behind the David Frost polling.” Another senior Conservative source said that during one rebel meeting, a Tory MP questioned what two aides were doing there. Parliamentary staff passes must be sponsored by a member of the Commons or Lords and those in possession of them must declare their interests and pass security vetting. A rebel source said: “Anyone wondering why Sunak is 20 points behind in the polls should look no further than the fact those running No 10 are focused on this nonsense.” Last week’s YouGov poll suggested the Tories were heading for a crushing election defeat, accompanied by an op-ed from Frost arguing that their only hope was to take a harder line on immigration. A new Tory leader would be the fourth Conservative prime minister in 18 months. Boris Johnson departed in September 2022 and was briefly succeeded by Truss before Sunak took charge. It prompted Labour’s national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, to say the Tories were forming “another circular firing squad”. “There are many good reasons for getting rid of this clapped-out Conservative government, and liberating the British people from endless bouts of Tory infighting is certainly one of them,” he said."

We would like to add that Hansard of 23 February 2022 shows Lord Scriven welcoming the extension of the right to vote to all British citizens abroad while expressing his concern about it leaving the door open for “the use of donations from very rich people … who will fund a particular party in this country”.

Lib Dems Abroad, in partnership with the Electoral Commission and other political and apolitical organisations, is now busy promoting overseas voter registration in the run-up to the next general election. Lib Dems Abroad believes, as a matter of principle, that overseas voters should be treated equitably to those who continue to live in the UK, especially given British citizens overseas now have full democratic rights.

        "content": "Rishi Sunak will cut taxes twice more before the election in an attempt to turn around the party’s position in the polls, the chair of the Conservatives has suggested. Richard Holden, who took on the job in the autumn, said more tax cuts were likely in the March budget and voters could expect another cut after that as well. He made the comments in an interview with GB News as the 2 percentage-point cut in national insurance kicked in this month. “What we are now in is a situation where we are coming out of that very tough period and we’re able to outline our plans for the future,” he said. “And I think the actual tax cut, you mentioned the national insurance cut for working people is the start of that. We’ll see more of that in March, and more of that later in the year as well. We have that new direction of travel, which is clear.” Holden’s remarks are the clearest statement that tax cuts will happen, despite recent forecasts suggesting that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, may have less leeway than previously thought. Experts had forecast headroom of £20bn but the Financial Times reported that Treasury forecasts suggested he had closer to £14bn for cutting taxes. Hunt has previously hinted that tax cuts are the “direction of travel we would like to go in” but said it was too early to say what he was going to do. In the GB News interview, Holden also said the Conservatives would consider an application from Nigel Farage to join the party. Farage was a Conservative many decades ago but has long been a political enemy as the leader of Ukip, the Brexit party and then the co-founder of Reform. Asked whether he wanted Farage to join the party, in light of polling that showed Reform could be a threat to the Tories’ electoral performance, Holden said: “Polls bounce around. Any application will be considered on its merits.” He played down current polls showing the Tories trailing Labour by 20 points or more, saying: “It’s quite understandable that between elections polls move around an awful lot.” Holden did not rule out reappointing the former deputy chair Lee Anderson, who quit this month over Sunak’s Rwanda plan. Anderson has since been hinting he would like his old job back and said he regretted abstaining on the bill. The party chair said: “It was sad to lose Lee. He does a lot of good for the party, fundraisers around the country. Really helping gee up the membership. I hope he continues to do that. “But the decisions on jobs for people are not one for me alone. I’ll have to chat to the chief whip and prime minister about it. But I think in the long term, you shouldn’t rule anything out. And in fairness to Lee, he was very decent and straightforward in his resignation letter.”"

        "content": "Monday You have to move fast to catch up with the Tory party these days. Not long ago there were six factions locked in a death spiral. The “Five Families” of the Tory right – the European Research Group, the Northern Research Group, the laughably named Common Sense Group, the New Conservatives and the Conservative Growth Group – and the One Nation moderates who are too feeble to do anything. As of last week, we could add one more: the mysterious Conservative Britain Alliance that funded the YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph which showed the Tories were heading for electoral wipeout and from which Lord Frost – the Tory peer who specialises in getting everything wrong – concluded that every foreigner should be deported to Rwanda. After this, the Tories’ self-styled election guru, Isaac Levido, concluded the Tories needed to unite a little. He’s obviously making good money from the Conservatives but he’s going to regret the hit to his credibility, because that merely sparked yet another splinter group. The new Popular Conservatism movement led by Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Simon Clarke announced it would be having its launch event in early February. Now, you might think it was pushing it to call anything with which Truss is associated “popular” – her last outing didn’t end so well – but she’s sure as hell popular with me. She is a sketch writer’s dream. Her leadership launch event in 2022 was unbeatable. First there was an embarrassed pause as she couldn’t find her way into a room packed with MPs and media who had had no trouble locating the door. Then, after a brief hustings speech, she made her way out through the audience and tried to exit via the window. We were on the first floor. You can’t buy that kind of comic timing. Excitingly, there’s a possibility Popular Conservatism may have splintered before it has begun with some parts being more popular than others. Clarke has gone rogue and called for Sunak to go without Liz giving him the say so. She is pretending to be loyal to Rishi by plotting against him. One day, we might remember what it was like to have a functioning government. Tuesday I think I may be finally done with TV reality shows. For years I’ve faithfully watched The Great Pottery Throw Down, which could have been made with me in mind. A ceramics enthusiast who regularly attends exhibitions and has no intention of stopping collecting even though I’ve already run out of room for the pots that I have. But enough is enough. Partly because every series now seems to be a repeat of the last, but mainly because the format itself is so superficial. There is almost no focus on the craft, the skills that the potters are being asked to use. Instead, virtually the entire show is devoted to the “personal journeys” that the contestants are on. How the teapot they are making showcases their experience of living by the seaside for the last 10 years. How a toilet bowl is the reincarnation of their beloved pet cat who tragically died a few months ago. All of which may be true, but is of next to no interest to me. I am not interested in the personal journeys of 10 people I don’t know and will have forgotten by the end of the series. What I want to know is if they can make ceramics that speak to me. Have a quality that can transform clay into a work of art. And nothing says a failing format more than employing a presenter to constantly interrupt with crap jokes. So the sooner reality shows get back to people doing real things rather than following some bogus TV narrative the better. There. Rant over. Wednesday Being invited on to Desert Island Discs would come fairly high on my bucket list. It’s not going to happen, of course, but that doesn’t stop me thinking about what my eight music choices would be from time to time. But cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason might just be regretting having said yes. Towards the end of what had been a lovely episode this week, the presenter, Lauren Laverne, asked him about playing at the Last Night of the Proms and what he felt about Rule, Britannia!. It was asked with no edge, no agenda, and Kanneh-Mason gave a thoughtful reply. It had been an honour to play at the Albert Hall but he had left before the end – musicians aren’t obliged to stick around – as Rule, Britannia! made him feel uncomfortable. Maybe the organisers should have another think about the finale for the Last Night. It wasn’t said in an angry or confrontational way. Just a statement of opinion. In an ideal world and all that. He probably didn’t give the pre-recorded interview another thought until last Sunday. Then all hell broke out, with the rightwing papers outraged at yet another imagined assault on British traditions. These culture wars get very tiring. There’s one going on at the Michaela school in north London, run by the self-declared “Britain’s strictest headteacher” Katharine Birbalsingh. The school is being sued for not providing a prayer room for Muslim children. Birbalsingh has refused, saying that Michaela is a secular school and does not cater to any faiths. It’s a position with which I wholeheartedly agree. I think all schools would be better off for sidelining religion. Only it turns out that at Michaela, there are degrees of secularism. According to reports, God Save the King, I Vow to Thee My Country and Jerusalem, are sung in rotation at the daily assembly. All three of these anthems/hymns have the idea of a God implicit in the words. And, with the best will in the world, it’s very much a Christian god. So I’d suggest Birbalsingh has a quick rethink of the assembly routine before telling Muslim children what’s what. Thursday The actor Tom Hollander has told a US chatshow how he once received the bonus meant for Spider-Man star Tom Holland for his role in The Avengers. Both actors shared the same agent and Hollander got an email to say he was suddenly enormously rich. For about an hour. Having thought he was doing OK and making a decent living, Hollander was now consumed with envy. Because Holland’s seven-figure payout wasn’t even a fee or a final bonus. It was just an interim payout because he was worth it. Holland probably wouldn’t even have noticed if the money had stayed in his near namesake’s account. I’ve only once been on the end of mistaken identity. Thankfully, it worked out to my advantage. I’d just started out as a freelance writer in 1989 – it was the only career I could think of which didn’t involve explaining a near 10-year gap on my CV – and I sent my first ever piece to the Independent on Sunday on spec. I thought that would be the end of it. That I had written into a void and would never hear back. Remarkably the features editor read it, said she liked it and offered me £400. I later worked out she had confused me with the novelist Jim Crace. After she realised her mistake, I got only £200 per article. I didn’t quibble. I knew my place. Friday Another long and tense night in Westminster. Not in the Commons this time. The Tories had called for a momentary breather in their long-running war with each other. But in Bellamy’s cafe/restaurant where the annual, fiercely competitive press lobby quiz took place. This year there were 20 teams of five from print, TV and radio. The Guardian team was heroically led by our political editor, Pippa Crerar, along with Peter Walker, Andy Sparrow, Aletha Adu and yours truly. Surprisingly, proceedings didn’t start with a minute’s silence while we all prayed for the king’s prostate. Practically all other business in parliament this week has kicked off with tributes to the royal family for having the same medical issues as the rest of us. Instead, we got stuck in straight away with rounds entitled Pot Luck and Lyrics. To our enormous credit, we were near the bottom of the pack after this. Frankly, I would have been embarrassed had we known the words to some dreary Britpop or Taylor Swift “so-called classic”. Had the questions focused on arias from Mozart or Verdi – or indeed the works of Leonard Cohen or Joni Mitchell – then we would have obviously stormed the round. I’ve always been deeply suspicious of anyone who can recite the words of every Oasis song. After four rounds we were lower to mid-table and Pippa gave us all a rousing pep talk. If we didn’t improve, then we were all going to be fired. Sometimes, tough love does the trick. We had a storming last round on Elections in which we played our joker and scored 20 out of 10, effortlessly answering who was elected in 2017 with over 99% of the vote. Answer: Paul Kagame of that notoriously safe country, Rwanda. We ended up in a very respectable sixth-equal. Not too boastful, but quietly effective. Last was … GB News."

        "content": "The UK’s first regular drug testing service is to open on Saturday in Bristol with a Home Office licence, marking a significant progressive shift in government policy. The testing will allow people who are frequent or dependent users of drugs including heroin, crack, benzos and spice to check they are not contaminated with harmful cutting agents, or adulterated with high-strength synthetic opioids such as nitazines or fentanyl. The free and confidential service will be open once a month initially and delivered by the drug-testing charity The Loop in partnership with the drug and alcohol services charity the Bristol Drugs Project (BDP) and Bristol city council, which is providing the funding. People who use drugs will be able to surrender small amounts into an amnesty bin at the BDP’s headquarters in central Bristol. The contents and strength of the drug will be chemically tested in a mobile lab. The service users return about an hour later to receive individually tailored harm reduction consultations with health professionals. No drugs are handed back, and local harm reduction alerts would be issued if dangerous drugs are detected. The aim is to reduce consumption of dangerous and high-strength drugs and thus lessen the risk of poisoning and overdose, while signposting service users to local treatment and health services. “This is a landmark moment for harm reduction,” said Prof Fiona Measham, the founder of The Loop and chair in criminology at the University of Liverpool. It followed 12 years of preparations, evaluations and negotiations with stakeholders, including the Home Office, during which time The Loop provided testing at a number of music festivals with local authority and police permission and demonstrated the public health benefits. “With more cities due to follow soon, this launch represents the start of a new era for drug-checking and it could not come at a more important time,” Measham added. “The risks from adulteration of the illegal drug market have never been greater.” There were almost 5,000 drug-related deaths in 2022, the highest level since records began, and there have been warnings that heroin is increasingly being cut with synthetic opioids, such as nitazenes, with dozens of deaths in relation to these potent drugs confirmed last year. There are fears those deaths may only be the tip of the iceberg – and drug testing would identify the presence of such substances. The Bristol city council lead for public health, Ellie King, said a public health approach to drug policy put people’s wellbeing first and was intended to help save lives. The service could be increased and made available more often if there is demand. “As the first city in the UK to have a regular drug-checking service in the heart of the city, we will be able to provide communities with access to factual, scientific, evidence-based information about drugs they may consume and that are in circulation throughout the wider city,” she said. The rollout of the service was delayed almost two years. The Loop was granted a Home Office licence for regular drug checking in March 2022 and the facility in central Bristol was ready to launch but it was delayed at the last minute by the council. The licence does not allow for non-dependent drug users to receive consultations about the contents of so-called party drugs such as MDMA. Evidence indicates that The Loop’s consultations with service users lead them to take drugs more responsibly. Studies at festivals where the charity has offered its facility have suggested a reduction in drug-related incidents onsite and in hospital admissions. “The government can help save lives by reducing risks of poisoning and overdose from adulterated or missold illegal drugs,” said Steve Rolles, the senior drug policy analyst at Transform Drug Policy Foundation. “The need for drug checking is becoming increasingly urgent in the UK with the growing threat from potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazines.” Drug-checking services have operated across cities in Europe for four decades, with apparent public health benefits. The opening of the service in Bristol will pave the way for cities in Scotland to move ahead with plans to establish similar facilities. The Loop is also in discussion with a handful of councils in other English cities. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are clear – there is no safe way to take illegal drugs. This licence, issued under strict conditions, will mean the most vulnerable people at risk of dying from their addiction can receive guidance and support to help them become drug free, whilst providing vital intelligence to local agencies and police to help respond to dangerous drugs in circulation.”"

        "content": "Britain should be prepared to review the size of its armed forces given the crisis in the Middle East and the threats from Russia and China, a member of the Biden administration has said during a visit to London. Carlos Del Toro, the US navy secretary, said the UK needed to consider more investment in its navy and reinforcing the army – a day after the head of the British army warned it was too small to fight an all-out war without conscription.   Related: German defence minister says military is unfit for problems Europe faces   Asked specifically about whether the US had concerns that Britain’s armed forces had become too small, Del Toro said: “I think it’s important for the United Kingdom to reassess where they are today, given the threats that exist today.” Although US leaders often call for European countries to increase their defence spending, pointed comments about the UK military are rare because of the closeness of the two countries’ military relationship. The US and UK are engaged in what is likely to be an extended bombing campaign against the Houthis, designed to stop the Yemeni group’s attacks on merchant shipping. However, Del Toro indicated there was no immediate need for Britain to step up its contribution. A shortage of sailors has forced the Royal Navy to decommission two ageing frigates, HMS Westminster and HMS Argyll, reducing its total to nine – while army numbers, at 73,520, are at the lowest level since the period after the end of the war of Spanish succession in 1714. Del Toro, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, said the UK had to make a “decision around whether the army needs to be strengthened” and said that the conflict in the Red Sea demonstrated the need for further spending to protect commercial shipping. “I would argue quite frankly that, given the near-term threats to the UK and the US, then investments in their [the UK’s] navy are significantly important.” That would “ensure that we have this free flow of trade” which “the economy of the United States, allies and partners can mutually benefit from”. Any decision to spend more on the UK armed forces would be a matter for the British government, Del Toro said, but “we in the United States have continued to make significant investments in our national security” amid economic challenges. The US is easily the world’s largest military spender, with a budget of $877bn (£690bn), according to figures compiled by the Economist. Despite recent cuts the UK is the sixth largest in dollar terms, spending £53bn in the current year. Del Toro said he was satisfied with the UK’s naval involvement in the Red Sea. Britain has deployed a destroyer, HMS Diamond, which specialises in shooting down drones and missiles. The British were “doing exactly what’s best, which is act as the protective umbrella providing air defence capabilities”. Asked whether the US could widen its operations to attack Iran, which it says provides the Houthis with drones and missile components, and intelligence and surveillance, Del Toro said: “Nothing is off the table.” • This article was amended on 26 January 2024. HMS Diamond is a destroyer, not a frigate as an earlier version said."

        "content": "The British Polling Council (BPC) has said there is “no reasonto believe that YouGov have not met their obligations” after examining controversial polling used to call for Rishi Sunak’s ousting. The two polls, which YouGov said were commissioned by a mysterious group of Tory rebels called the Conservative Britain Alliance, with the Tory peer David Frost acting as the intermediary, caused shock waves in Westminster when they were published in the Daily Telegraph last week. The BPC examined the polls, one of which focused on migration, on Wednesday and Thursday before issuing a statement, which said: “There is no reason at present to believe that YouGov have not met their obligations under its rules.” The main poll projected that the Conservatives were on track for a 1997-style defeat, but that the party could win if Sunak were replaced by a hypothetical Tory leader who cut taxes and immigration. The findings were unveiled on the front page of the Telegraph alongside a piece by Lord Frost arguing Sunak’s current strategy was leading the party to annihilation. This week, the Tory MP Simon Clarke cited the poll’s findings in an article calling for Sunak to be ousted.   Related: Former adviser to Rishi Sunak working with Tory rebels trying to oust him   There have been questions about who commissioned the survey, which would have cost tens of thousands of pounds. The Conservative Britain Alliance is said to consist of a group of Tory donors. The BPC discussed the controversy at its regular meeting on Wednesday and asked YouGov if it had documentation showing that the Conservative Britain Alliance was its client, according to one of its committee members. Nick Moon, secretary of the BPC, said on Thursday morning: “Under the rules of the BPC, YouGov has to publish the details of the poll, including who their client was. “They’ve said the client was the Conservative Britain Alliance. We’re just making sure that they were formally hired by this organisation.” In the evening, the BPC issued a statement saying it was satisfied that the Conservative Britain Alliance was the client.  It read: “The BPC have been advised that this is the organisation that was responsible for commissioning the poll, and that therefore there is no reason at present to believe that YouGov have not met their obligations under its rules.” Requesting further information about the Conservative Britain Alliance “lies beyond its remit”, the BPC said, but it added it was “alive to identifying any lessons for its work that may be thought to arise from this incident”. YouGov said: “Over the past week, YouGov has sought guidance from the BPC and received assurances that we have followed the rules.”   Related: Simon Clarke advised to lie down by Tory MP after calling for Sunak to quit   The BPC is an industry group for polling companies that promotes transparency, but does not have any formal powers. Under its guidelines, clients do not have to be registered companies or have any formal status in order to commission polling. Pollsters do not need to specify who paid for the work. “So long as [the Conservative Britain Alliance] were actually the client they’ve met the rules,” Moon said. “If I were to form the St Albans Walrus Protection Society, that body could go out and commission polls about walruses. Any polling company would be very happy to take my money.” The saga has caused a headache for YouGov and has triggered calls for improved transparency around who pays for polling. YouGov issued a clarification on Wednesday after heavy criticism of the section of the survey which asked voters to choose between Labour leader Keir Starmer and an imaginary Tory leader who cut taxes, immigration and NHS waiting times.  Rob Ford, a pollster and professor of political science at the University of Manchester, called it “one of the worst polling questions I’ve ever seen”."

        "content": "Ministers have been accused of throwing away taxpayers’ money “as if it were confetti” after official figures revealed that the government wasted nearly £10bn on defective or unusable personal protective equipment during the Covid crisis. Annual accounts for the Department of Health and Social Care published on Thursday show that nearly three-quarters of the money it spent on PPE during the pandemic has been written off. The figures show £9.9bn of the £13.6bn worth of PPE that the department bought between 2020 and 2022 was unusable or its value is now less than the government paid for it. This includes defective or unsuitable equipment as well as PPE that could not be used before its expiry date. Gareth Davies, the comptroller and auditor general of the National Audit Office, said: “Ongoing efforts to detect, prevent and recover fraud must continue, improving public confidence that this drain on the public finances is being tackled effectively and efficiently.” The figures come as the National Crime Agency investigates allegations of bribery and fraud in the awarding of PPE contracts. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: “As chancellor, Rishi Sunak threw away taxpayers’ money as if it were confetti and has failed to get our money back. Sunak’s carelessness has cost our country dear. Never again can the Conservatives claim to be the careful stewards of the public finances. “A Labour government will appoint a Covid corruption commissioner to chase down those who ripped off the British taxpayer, and we’ll set up an Office of Value for Money so every penny of public money is spent wisely.” The Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said: “This is a sickening level of waste. Billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been poured down the drain because of this Conservative government’s incompetence. To rub salt in the wound, some of this money was wasted on dodgy contracts with Conservative cronies, the vast majority of which has still not been recovered. “The health secretary should come to parliament and explain how so much taxpayers’ money was frittered away and what is being done to get it back.” Downing Street defended the losses. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “It’s important not to forget the circumstances in which the UK and countries globally found themselves during a pandemic when globally PPE was in extremely short supply.  “The costs as a result increased significantly and the government took the decision very transparently to do everything possible to secure protective equipment for frontline health and care workers. That was right.”"

        "content": "Drip, drip, drip. The first rule of any political rebellion is to learn how to count. Something the none too bright Simon Clarke has yet to master. Though, to be fair, it is more than possible that several MPs who promised to support his call for Rishi Sunak to be replaced faded back into the shadows when the time came. Disloyalty can be contagious. If you can betray Rish! then it’s all too easy to betray Simple Simon. And the Tory right are not noted for keeping their promises. So Clarke had been left to go it alone. A one-man rebellion shouted down by Tories from both the left and the right of the party. The closest to unity the Conservatives had come in months. And all because Simple Simon had committed the cardinal sin of telling the truth. That kind of error just can’t be tolerated. Every Tory knows the polling is desperate, that Sunak is desperately unpopular and that the government faces annihilation at the election. It’s just that this information has to be borne with a stoicism bordering on denial. Not least because to suggest doing something about it by replacing Rishi risks a more immediate disaster of yet another unelected prime minister. It’s lose-lose. Having originally stomped off in a sulk after finding himself on his own, Simple Simon came out of hiding for a few minutes to give a short interview to the BBC. Mainly it seemed to troll Liz Truss with a few gags about iceberg lettuces – presumably he had imagined she would be putting herself forward as the nation’s saviour – rather than to add anything new.  His basic argument was that the Tories were fucked if they stuck with Rishi and fucked if they didn’t. But the latter option might be more exciting. And it wasn’t as if the government was doing anything. But it turned out Simple Simon wasn’t entirely alone. Because also jumping ship was Will Dry, a previously unknown special adviser in No 10. Dry, it turned out, was 26 going on 14. A photo of him revealed a teen who had been rejected at an audition for The Inbetweeners on the grounds that he looked far too young.  And yet Will had somehow come to be a Downing Street essential. Sunak couldn’t function without him. The man boy, who knew little and had done less, was more or less running the country. No wonder everything is all going so well. But in his short working life, Dry has been on quite the journey. As a second-year undergraduate, he was part of a campaign to rejoin the EU. That seems to be the last sensible thing anyone can remember him doing. Because even as it became clearer to everyone that all of the so-called Brexit bonuses had turned out to be imaginary, Will became a Brexit believer and a signed-up member of the Sunak fan club. Will couldn’t leave it there, though. For now Sunak is too mainstream, too centrist for him. The Rwanda plan is for wimps. So Dry has jumped ship and hooked up with the Conservative Britain Alliance (CBA), a largely anonymous group of rightwing misfits headed up by that serial failure David Frost.  Give Dry a few more minutes and he’ll be in bed with Richard Tice and Nigel Farage. And by the end of the year he will be working with Vladimir Putin. You get the feeling Dry likes strong government. It seems that Will’s specialism is polling. Some call him a guru. That would be his imaginary friends. After all, you don’t need to be a genius to work out that the polling data for Sunak is dire. And his main contribution to his new – temporary – soulmates at the CBA has been to compile one of the most idiotic questionnaires in polling history.  “If there was a really brilliant Tory leader, one who everybody in the country really liked and could cut taxes while not crashing the economy, who could find a cure for dementia and bring world peace: would you then vote for him, rather than Keir Starmer?” Clearly, the boy will go far. On second thoughts, maybe you can see why Tories aren’t rushing to rally behind Simple Simon. From one loser to another. But in the meantime, the government has to maintain the fiction that it is actually doing something other than fighting among itself. So it was the turn of the junior policing minister, Chris Philp, to look busy. Philp is something of a collector’s item. Widely considered – even by fellow ministers – to be less than competent, but adored by himself. Seemingly undeterred by his slide down the pecking order – he was once a cabinet minister under Liz Truss, a sure sign that he isn’t actually very good – Chris is quite happy to repeat any nonsense that anyone in power wants him to.  It’s doubtful he actually believes anything much at all, because to believe requires some thought and some integrity. Albeit misguided. Rather he is the brown-noser’s brown-noser. Still, the Philpster loves himself. Even though he lacks self-awareness. His Twitter biography describes him as a “serial entrepreneur”. Maybe one day he will get round to repaying those who lost thousands when businesses he founded went bankrupt. Just a thought. But for Thursday morning, Chris was out and about on the airwaves bigging up the government’s latest ideas to reduce knife crime. It didn’t go altogether to plan. Not least because every interviewer could spot the very obvious flaws. First, the government had come up with 16 previous proposals that hadn’t worked. Why should this one? Especially when it wasn’t due to be implemented until the autumn. Philp was all bristle and bustle. No one could possibly have foreseen that manufacturers would get around legislation by making zombie knives without markings, he said. That had really blindsided him.  And no, he hadn’t thought to include swords because … because … why would he? “Look,” he continued. “I know the legislation will need tightening up, but we can tighten it up later.” Run that past us again. You know it’s bad legislation but you can’t be bothered to get it right now? Yup, that was exactly it, Chris nodded enthusiastically.  So why had the government cut youth services by 75%? That was because Labour had crashed the economy. Not only was this untrue, but it’s a measure of the failure. The Tories have been in power for 14 years and are still disowning any responsibility. And that was that. Philp came back to the Home Office, genuinely believing he had nailed it. This can’t go on. The next rebellion can’t be far away."

        "content": "  5.00pm GMT  Afternoon summary   Ed Balls, a former shadow chancellor, has said that Keir Starmer should perform a “big U-turn” over the commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment. (See 4.20pm.)   Nicola Sturgeon described Boris Johnson as “a fucking clown” as he announced a second Covid lockdown in October 2020, telling her chief of staff: “His utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere.”   Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has apologised “unreservedly” to the Covid inquiry, and to people who were bereaved during the pandemic, for the government’s “poor handling” of requests for messages. (See 2.15pm.)   The UK would break international law if it ignored emergency orders from the European court of human rights to stop asylum seekers being flown to Rwanda, the head of the court has said.   Chris Philp, the policing minister, has admitted that a previous government crackdown on zombie knives contained an obvious loophole. (See 9.24am.)   The British Polling Council (BPC) is looking into controversial YouGov polling used by Conservative plotters to call for Rishi Sunak to be ousted.   David Cameron breached “proper process” when he appointed Michelle Mone to the House of Lords in 2015, David Mundell, who was the Scotland secretary at the time, has said.   More than one in 100 children in England were homeschooled last summer term, with many parents citing lifestyle or “philosophical reasons” for abandoning traditional classrooms.   Updated at 5.09pm GMT    4.40pm GMT  Sunak restates his determination not to let 'foreign court' stop deportation flights to Rwanda  Rishi Sunak has restated his willingness to defy the European court of human rights if it imposes an injunction to stop a deportation flight taking off to Rwanda. Speaking to broadcasters after the president of the European court of human rights, Síofra O’Leary, said that defying such an injunction would break international law, Sunak repeated a line he has used repeatedly in recent weeks. He said:  I’ve been very clear, I won’t let a foreign court stop us from getting flights up and running and establishing that deterrent. The bill that we’ve just passed through the House of Commons has a specific power in it that says ministers will get to make those decisions, I would not have put that power in there if I wasn’t prepared to use it.  Sunak’s comments have been welcomed by Conservative MPs, although hardliners want him to go further and to commit to definitely defying ECHR injunctions. They tried to insert a clause to this effect in the Rwanda bill, but the government did not accept it. Earlier No 10 argued that, given the changes made to the policy, the ECHR would not need to issue an injunction in the way it did in 2022. (See 12.48pm.)  Updated at 4.43pm GMT    4.26pm GMT       4.20pm GMT  Ed Balls says Starmer should perform 'big U-turn' and drop £28bn as size of green jobs plan  Keir Starmer should perform a “big U-turn” over the commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment, Ed Balls has said. Balls, a former shadow chancellor who is married to Yvette Cooper, the current shadow home secretary, said that having that number attached to the green investment plan was a problem for Labour and that a U-turn had to be big enough to get noticed. He made the comment in the latest episiode of his Political Currency podcast, which he hosts with George Osborne, the Tory former chancellor. Balls, who is now a presenter on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, said that Labour has already tried “partial U-turns” on the £28bn-a-year green investment pledge. Labour has said that it would not get spending up to that level until the second half of a parliament, that some of the money will come from investment already committed by the government, and that if borrowing to fund the investment would break the fiscal rules, it would not happen. But this has not stopped the Conservatives repeatedly claiming that Keir Starmer will have to put up taxes to fund the pledge – even though Starmer has explictly said he will not do that. Balls said Labour now needed “a big U-turn” because the partial ones had not worked. He explained:  If you’re going to do a U-turn, you’ve got to notice it, you’ve got to see it happen. People need to hear Labour say that their commitment to sound public finances and the fiscal rules comes before spending more money on this agenda. Or they’re going to be open to this attack. If they don’t say something now, they’re going to be asked about this in every interview. So I would say there is going to be a U-turn and that they won’t resile from a green plan, they won’t resile from the idea that that’s a way to grow some jobs, they won’t resile from the idea that you can spend now to strengthen the economy in the long term. But I think they’ll have to come off this £28bn number. They’ll have to say the £28bn number is gone, that it’s ditched or else they can be open to this attack … You need something which looks like a U-turn … They’ve tried partial U-turns. It hasn’t worked. They need a big U-turn.  In the same episode Osborne said Rishi Sunak would only make his leadership secure by getting a lead in the opinion polls. He said:  The only leadership strategy that works in the Tory party is having a poll lead. The only thing that works as a unifying strategy is the promise that you might win the election. And you can announce any amount of policy, you can make any amount of promises to the Conservative party. If you don’t look like you’re going to win, you’re going to have huge leadership problems.   Updated at 4.31pm GMT    3.56pm GMT   Humza Yousaf described the Scottish Police Federation as a disgrace in a private message towards the end of the pandemic, the inquiry heard. It was shown an exchange of messages between Yousaf, then health secretary, and John Swinney, then deputy first minister. Referring to the SPF, Yousaf said:  They’re a disgrace. Right through this pandemic they have shown an arrogance and retrograde thinking. Chief [constable] was livid last night.  Asked why he described the SPF like this, Yousaf said:  I was expressing frustration in a private conversation. Sometimes when you are venting to a colleague you use language you regret.  Kathryn Samson from Channel 4 News has posted a screenshot of the exchange on X.

Leitch told him that, as long as he was holding a drink, he did not need a mask. Jamie Dawson KC, counsel for the inquiry, put it to him that if he needed guidance on this, as health secretary, then the rules were too complicated for everyone else.  If the cabinet secretary for health and social care felt the need to clarify the rules, what chance do others have in understanding the rules?  Yousaf said that it was because of his job that he felt the need to, not just double check or triple check, but quadruple check what the rules were. He had to get them right, he said.  As the cabinet secretary for health and social care I didn’t want to just double-check the rules, triple check them, I would quadruple check them if I had to, because the intensity of the public scrutiny that we were under.  Dawson asked if he was concerned when Leitch told him that “literally no one” wore a mask when they were standing up and talking at a dinner, even though they should be doing that. Yousaf said that Leitch, by his own admission, had a “casual way of speaking”. He had a tendency to “over-speak”, he said. Q: Leitch was giving you a loophole, wasn’t he? Yousaf did not accept that. He said he was just seeking clarification on how to follow the rules.

He will chair a new towns unit “to ensure the voices of UK towns are heard loud and clear across government and that vital regeneration comes to life”.     2.52pm GMT  YouGov called on to confirm who commissioned poll on Sunak defeat  The British Polling Council (BPC) is looking into controversial YouGov polling used by Conservative plotters to call for Rishi Sunak to be ousted, Eleni Courea reports.   Related: YouGov called on to confirm who commissioned poll on Sunak defeat       2.44pm GMT  Outgoing Welsh FM Mark Drakeford urges UK Labour not to adopt 'King Canute' opposition to further devolution  The outgoing Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has hit back at UK Labour, urging his Westminster colleagues to avoid adopting a “King Canute” stance on devolution. Drakeford said there were some in London who regard devolution as a “zero-sum game, that anything that is devolved elsewhere is a loss to them”. He was speaking at an event at the Institute for Government, only days after the shadow Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, rejected the Welsh administrations’s longstanding call for more powers over policing and justice. Stevens said Labour would be focusing on the “things that matter” at the next election, listing “growing the economy, creating new jobs, getting cheaper bills, building an NHS fit for the future and breaking down barriers for opportunities for children and young people across the country”. Drakeford said UK Labour had a “responsibility” to show the “journey has begun” on devolution if they won the election this year, and he said he hoped Keir Starmer would make an “early commitment” to adopting Gordon Brown’s report on the UK’s future, which urged a Labour government to “embark upon the devolution of youth justice and the probation service”. Drakeford went on:  There are some colleagues in London who regard this as a zero-sum game, that anything that is devolved elsewhere is a loss to them. All four police and crime commissioners in Wales are firmly in favour of the devolution of policing. So again, even people who are close to the operational end of all this share our view.  Drakeford who is due to step down as Welsh Labour leader in March, advised his successor to “be bold” and always “look for those radical changes that are necessary”.  Updated at 2.55pm GMT    2.37pm GMT  Maintenance loans for students in England to rise by just 2.5% next year  Next year’s university students in England will be left worse off after the government said it will increase their maintenance loans by just 2.5%, following this year’s rise of 2.8% during a period of high inflation.The Russell Group of leading research universities said the 2.5% rise means that students will miss out on £2,000 worth of support they would have received if the loans had risen in line with inflation since 2021-22. Joanna Burton, the Russell Group’s head of policy, said:  Once again, we are disappointed to see that there has been no move to correct the maintenance loan shortfall suffered by students in recent years. Inflation may now be slowing down, but today’s announcement fails to address the deficit that has been created across the last three years. We know that a quarter of students regularly go without food and other necessities due to financial hardship, and it’s vital they are provided with adequate loan provision so they can afford the essentials and focus on their studies.Russell Group universities have spent tens of millions from their existing budgets on additional support measures over the past year, but it’s not feasible for universities to plug the gap in maintenance provision on their own. The hardest hit will be the most disadvantaged students, who are most at risk of dropping out due to financial pressures.  Robert Halfon, the minister for skills and higher education, said the 2.5% increase “follows standard procedure to base annual increases in support on forecasted inflation”. Halfon added:  Decisions on student finance have had to be taken to ensure the system remains financially sustainable and the costs of higher education are shared fairly between students and taxpayers, not all of whom have benefited from going to university.      2.30pm GMT   Yousaf says he did not discuss his production of WhatsApp messages to the inquiry with Nicola Sturgeon.     2.29pm GMT   Dawson says, after the Scottish government gave its account in October last year of what messages it had, Yousaf found a phone containing old messages. Yousaf said he knew he had the old phone. He originally thought that the messages on it were not recoverable. But when he logged on using the old phone, he found they were recoverable. Dawson suggests it is now possible for the inquiry to compared the “corporate record” of key decisions taken, and what the Yousaf messages show was actually discussed. Yousaf says the two can be compared. He says key decisions and salient points were recorded by his office. If they weren’t, they were not taken forward. Q: But you were also required to record discussions relating to decisions. Yousaf says he thinks these points should be covered by the “salient points” he said should have been recorded on the corporate record. Q: Should have been recorded on the corporate record, or were recorded on the corporate record? Yousaf says it was always his intention to record those points.  Updated at 2.38pm GMT    2.23pm GMT   Q: You are a heavy user of WhatsApp. Yousaf says he uses it on a daily basis. Q: And you had multiple phones over this period. Yousaf says he had both personal and government devices. Dawson shows the inquiry a document setting out Yousaf’s use of WhatsApp during this period. Dawson says this was the summary given to the Covid inquiry by the Scottish government in October last year. He asks if this is an accurate summary. Yousaf says the situation has developed. Q: How were WhatsApp messages recorded on the “corporate record” if that had to happen? Yousaf said, if a decision was taken on WhatsApp, private office had to be informed so that it could be placed in the system. No decision would be actionable unless it was on the corporate record. Q: And after that WhatsApp messages were deleted. Yousaf said the guidance was that, once messages were on the corporate record, they should be deleted for cyber security reasons.  Updated at 2.40pm GMT    2.15pm GMT  Yousaf apologises for Scottish government's 'poor handling' of Covid inquiry's requests for WhatsApp messages  Yousaf says he wants to apologise to the inquiry, and to people who were bereaved during the pandemic, for the government’s “poor handling” of requests for messages. He says there is a recognition in government that any record of important decisions should be recorded. But, because government had that corporate record, there was a view that that was all that needed to be handed over. He says there has been a gap in terms of what gets recorded. That is why he has ordered an inquiry into the use of unofficial message channels like WhatsApp, he says. (See 1.18pm.)  Updated at 2.40pm GMT    2.11pm GMT  Yousaf plays down claims at Covid inquiry that Sturgeon wanted to limit role of other ministers in decisions  Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, and health secretary from 2021 to 2023, is giving evidence to the UK Covid inquiry in Edinburgh now. He has rejected suggestions that cabinet was only a forum where decisions were rubber stamped. But Jamie Dawson KC put it to him that Nicola Sturgeon preferred to take decisons in a small group. He flags up a message Yousaf received, on the day be became health secretary, from Jason Leitch, Scotland’s national clinical director, saying:  There was some FM ‘keep it small’ shenanigans as always. She actually wants none of us.  Yousaf said that was Leitch “over-speaking”.  Updated at 2.11pm GMT    1.31pm GMT  Shoplifting up 32% in England and Wales compared with previous year, ONS figures show  Labour says crime figures out today, one set published by the Office for National Statistics and another set published by the Home Office, show knife crime and shoplifting getting worse. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said:  This disturbing further increase in knife crime in the last year shows how badly the Tories are failing on law and order and means that knife crime is now 77% higher than in 2015, with a devastating impact on young people, families and communities. Serious violence is rising with gun crime also increasing, yet the government just isn’t getting a grip. At the same time shoplifting has soared by 32% in the last year alone, as criminals run rife in our town centres, and the number of cases dropped because no suspect was identified has reached record highs.  In its report on crime in England and Wales in the year ending September 2023, the ONS says:  Police recorded theft has increased by 9% (to 1.8 million offences) compared with the year ending September 2022. This rise was predominantly the result of increases in shoplifting offences. The year ending September 2023 saw a 32% increase in the number of shoplifting offences recorded compared with the previous year, with 402,482 offences compared with 304,459 offences in the year ending September 2022.   Updated at 1.37pm GMT    1.18pm GMT  Humza Yousaf announces inquiry into Scottish government's use of WhatsApp  Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, has announced an externally-led review into the use of WhatsApp and other unofficial technology in the Scottish government. Speaking during first minister’s questions, he told MSPs that Covid inquiry revelations about official communication processes being sidelined had been embarrassing. He said:  I do believe that there are challenges in relation to our use of WhatsApp. It has not been frankly the government’s finest hour in relation to handling those requests [for WhatsApp messages] and I put my hands up to that, unlike of course other governments. That’s why I have commissioned officials to deliver an externally-led review – not a government review but an externally-led review – into the use of mobile messaging apps and the use of non-corporate technology in the Scottish government, and that should take particular account of our interaction with statutory public inquiries. When it comes to being transparent, the government handed over 28,000 messages, 19,000 documents. I myself as first minister of the government have handed over my WhatsApp messages.  Yousaf will appear at the Covid inquiry this afternoon.     1.12pm GMT   Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s former first minister, may have communicated with Liz Lloyd, her chief of staff, using a personal mobile phone during Covid, the inquiry has heard. Lloyd told the inquiry this morning that Sturgeon only ever communicated with her using one phone. She said she did not know who had issued it. When it was put to her that, if the inquiry heard that Sturgeon did not have a government phone and only used a personal one, then she must have used that personal one to conduct government business with Lloyd, Lloyd replied:  Evidently we had discussions about government business on the phone that she had.  Usman Tariq, counsel to the inquiry, went on: As her chief of staff, did you ever advise her that it might be a good idea to use a government-issued phone to conduct government business? Lloyd replied:  I don’t know that I did. I am aware that on ministers’ personal phones the government installs a sort of secure app, so I would be less concerned with the device and more concerned with the security.   Updated at 1.15pm GMT    1.03pm GMT  £9.9bn of £13.6bn spent on PPE during Covid written down because it's unusable or its value has fallen, DHSC reveals  Some £9.9bn of the £13.6bn spent on personal protective equipment (PPE) has been written down because it was unusable or its value has crashed since the pandemic, PA Media reports. PA says:  The Department of Health and Social Care’s accounts published today said some items were defective or not suitable, while others will not be used before their expiry date. The accountability report by the National Audit Office (NAO) said that the department plans to dispose of “nearly all” of its current PPE stock held in warehouses and containers. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said the majority of the PPE recorded was of “insignificant value”. He said that “ongoing efforts to detect, prevent and recover fraud must continue, improving public confidence that this drain on the public finances is being tackled effectively and efficiently”. Downing Street defended the losses by stressing the havoc that Covid-19 wreaked. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “It’s important not to forget the circumstances in which the UK and countries globally found themselves during a pandemic when globally PPE was in extremely short supply. The costs as a result increased significantly and the government took the decision very transparently to do everything possible to secure protective equipment for frontline health and care workers, that was right.”      12.48pm GMT  No 10 brushes aside warning from ECHR's top judge that ignoring Rwanda flight injunction would be unlawful  No 10 has brushed aside a warning from the president of the European court of human rights saying it would be against international law for the UK to ignore injunctions blocking flights to Rwanda. At a news conference this morning, Síofra O’Leary, president of the court, said there was a “clear legal obligation” on states to obey injunctions, known as rule 39 orders, from the court. The government’s first attempt to send a deportation flight to Rwanda in 2022 was stopped by an order from the court. The government’s new Rwanda bill, which is still going through parliament, says it is for ministers to decide whether or not to obey any future injunctions in these cases, but Rishi Sunak has angered some of his MPs by not firmly stating that injunctions will definitely be ignored. Instead, he has just said that in some circumstances he would ignore them. At her news conference, O’Leary said:  There is a clear legal obligation under the convention for states to comply with rule 39 measures.  In a speech proceeding her Q&A, O’Leary said injunctions were only issued “in exceptional circumstances where there is a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm”. She also said the UK “has always complied with rule 39 measures”, except in one very particular case, and has “publicly declared the need for other states to comply with rule 39 indications” – including urging Vladimir Putin’s Russia to abide by a 2021 measure in relation to the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Asked to respond to O’Leary’s comment, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the No 10 lobby briefing that the government did not think rule 39 orders would be justified in relation to Rwanda given changes made to the policy. He also restated the PM’s willingness to ignore them. The spokesperson said:  I think, firstly, we are confident our legislation is compliant with our international obligations. We’re clear the bill and the treaty address the supreme court’s concerns. There should be no need for Strasburg to intervene to block flights in the way they did in 2022. We’ve also drafted the bill to give ministers the power not to comply with those rulings if necessary. And obviously every case is assessed on its individual facts, but the prime minister has been clear repeatedly that we will not let a foreign court block flights from taking off.  The spokesperson also said it was “bizarre” to compare the UK ignoring rule 39 orders to Russia. He said:  I think it would be bizarre to draw any comparison between Russia’s cruel treatment of Alexei Navalny, who was a victim of an attempted assassination, and our plan to protect and deter vulnerable migrants from making perilous crossings across the Channel.   Updated at 12.54pm GMT    12.11pm GMT  New ban on zombie-style knives 'goes nowhere near far enough', Labour claims  The Home Office has now published a news release with details of its ban on zombie-style knives. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the new ban “goes nowhere near far enough and it is also too little, too late”. Speaking on a visit to a police station in Milton Keynes, she said the penalties were not strong enough, and the new ban was not going to take effect until the autumn. She also said it was still too narrow. She told journalists:  It doesn’t include ninja swords, it doesn’t include a whole series of dangerous weapons … We need much faster action, at a time when knife crime has gone up by a further 5% this year, 77% increase since 2015. This is an epidemic, we need action.      12.03pm GMT   Knife crime offences recorded by police forces in England and Wales rose year-on-year in the latest figures, but have not yet returned to levels seen before the Covid pandemic, PA Media reports. PA says:  Some 48,716 offences were recorded in the 12 months to September 2023. This is up 5% from 46,367 in the previous 12 months, but is 5% lower than the 51,228 in the year to March 2020. These figures do not include Devon & Cornwall and Greater Manchester police, due to issues involving the supply of data. There has been a “notable increase” in the number of robberies involving a knife or sharp instrument, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which compiled the figures. These jumped from 16,746 in the year to September 2022 to 20,000 in the year to September 2023, a rise of 19% – though the total is still below pre-pandemic levels. Knife-enabled homicides stood at 240 in the 12 months to September 2023, broadly unchanged on the 241 recorded in the previous year and also lower than pre-pandemic figures.      11.52am GMT       11.48am GMT   At the Covid inquiry hearing in Edinburgh Liz Lloyd, Nicola Sturgeon’s former chief of staff, was asked about her wanting a row with the UK government. (See 11.35am.) Asked if she was looking for a spat, Lloyd replied:  I was looking for a spat with a purpose. It had been shown in the past that they would sometimes change their mind if they felt that pressure and I wanted them to change their mind.  As PA Media reports, handwritten notes shown earlier in evidence showed Lloyd suggesting a possible strategy of “calling for things” that the Scottish government could not do to “force the UK government to do things”.     11.35am GMT  Nicola Sturgeon regarded Boris Johnson as 'a fucking clown' because of his handling of Covid, inquiry learns  Nicola Sturgeon called Boris Johnson “a fucking clown” in a private message when he announced a further Covid lockdown on 31 October 2020, the inquiry has heard. As PA Media reports, at a hearing in Edinburgh this morning the inquiry highlighted WhatsApp messages between Sturgeon and Liz Lloyd, her chief of staff. PA says:  Sturgeon said his address was “fucking excruciating” and that the UK communications were “awful”. Sturgeon also told Lloyd: “His utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere.” Lloyd said she was “offended” on behalf of special advisers everywhere. Sturgeon replied: “He is a fucking clown.” Lloyd told Sturgeon she wanted a “good old-fashioned rammy” with the UK government so she could “think about something other than sick people” in WhatsApp messages. Asked about the messages, Lloyd said the Scottish government were “clearly not complimentary about [the UK government’s] communications handling”. She said: “We had to mitigate the chaos that appeared around some of the decisions they took.” Junior counsel to the inquiry Usman Tariq asked Lloyd if the relationship between the then first minister and then prime minister had “broken down”. Lloyd replied: “That overstates what was there to break.” Commenting on Johnson, she said: “He didn’t want to be on those calls, he wasn’t well briefed, he wasn’t listening, engagement with him became slightly pointless. They didn’t get us anywhere. We started with the approach we should work together, in co-ordinated fashion, but a substantive discussion isn’t what we got. The prime minister was reading a script and would largely ignore points made.” She said Sturgeon’s strong language showed her “frustration” towards Johnson.  Kathryn Samson from Channel 4 News has posted the WhatsApp exchange on X.  “This is fucking excruciating.” “He is a fucking clown.” Nicola Sturgeon WhatsApps her closest advisor during Boris Johnson’s  address to the nation during the second lockdown in Oct 2020. pic.twitter.com/EbXREu0p0H— kathryn samson (@KathrynSamsonC4) January 25, 2024   Updated at 11.41am GMT    11.01am GMT  40% investigations into crimes closed without suspects being identified, Home Office figures show  The government has been accused of “failing” on crime following the publication of Home Office figures showing that 2.18m offences were closed in England and Wales in the year ending September 2023 without a suspect being identified. That was 40% of all recorded offences – up from 37% the previous years. The figures also show that only 5.9% of recorded offences have so far resulted in charges. That is up from 5.5% the previous year. Some 8% of cases are recorded as not yet having an outcome, which means they are still being investigated. Other recorded offences have not resulted in charges largely because of evidential difficulties. The figures were highlighted by the Liberal Democrats. Alistair Carmichael, their home affairs spokesperson, said:  The Conservative government has totally failed to get a handle on crime, and they have no one but themselves to blame.For years, they have taken resources out of frontline policing at the expense of our communities. It’s no surprise that more and more criminals are getting away with it as victims are left without justice.   Updated at 11.04am GMT    10.34am GMT  Former adviser to Rishi Sunak working with Tory rebels trying to oust him  Will Dry, a former special adviser to Rishi Sunak, is reportedly working with a group of rebels trying to oust the prime minister and helped commission polling which predicted a landslide Labour victory, Tom Ambrose reports.   Related: Former adviser to Rishi Sunak working with Tory rebels trying to oust him   There are further details in the Times, which says Dry has been “working with a loose grouping of about a dozen former government political advisers and MPs who believe that the Tories are doomed under Sunak’s leadership”. It reports:  The rebel group is based in central London. They are said to be working with around ten Tory MPs as they draw up plans to remove Sunak from office. Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, is said to be among those who believe there needs to be a new prime minister. She has repeatedly said that Sunak needs to “change course”.   Updated at 10.39am GMT    10.20am GMT  Sturgeon denies concealing emails relevant to Covid crisis from inquiry  Nicola Sturgeon has denied concealing emails about the covid crisis from her private Scottish National party account, and said those “relevant to the management of the pandemic” have been handed over. Yesterday opposition leaders demanded full disclosure of emails from her SNP account after the UK Covid inquiry released evidence from the public health expert Prof Devi Sridhar that Sturgeon offered to use her private party account for government business. Sturgeon told Sridhar: “Don’t worry about protocol.” In response, a source close to the former first minister said:  Any emails relevant to the management of the pandemic received by Nicola to her private email were passed to the Scottish government so that they could be actioned and recorded appropriately.  Yesterday Scottish Labour urged John-Paul Marks, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, to establish whether or not emails on government business had been handed over to the inquiry. The Scottish government has not yet responded on his behalf. The Scottish Tories said Sturgeon should publish them – a demand she seems to have rejected. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said Sturgeon’s carefully-worded response was far from enough. She said:  The full disclosure of all communications is necessary and it’s for the inquiry to determine what is relevant. The former first minister has form here: during the Salmond inquiry [into the Scottish government’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations against him], reference was made to use of SNP emails to avoid scrutiny. All SNP emails need to be disclosed. And the former first minister knows that government business shouldn’t be conducted on private emails and she was breaching those rules.      Updated at 10.44am GMT    10.13am GMT   Last night ITV published fresh polling, carried out by YouGov for Labour’s Fabian Society, showing that Labour’s lead in its 150 top target seats is even bigger than its lead across the country as a whole. The polling suggests Labour has a 24-point lead nationally (Lab 46%, Con 22%), but a 34-point lead in the battleground seats (Lab 52%, Con 18%).  🚨NEW Labour has a 34 point lead over the Conservatives in 150 key target seats, per exclusive @thefabians analysisThis is 10 points higher than the national average 👀GB🌹LAB 46%🌳CON 22% TARGET SEATS🌹LAB 52%🌳CON 18%💻LIVE 9PM @itvpeston📺10.45PM @ITV #Peston pic.twitter.com/LMJDTeVKpb— Peston (@itvpeston) January 24, 2024  The full details of the polling are in this Fabian Society report.     9.50am GMT  Philp says technology should be available in 2025 to allow police to scan people for knives as they're walking down street  Chris Philp, the policing minister, also said that within about a year the police might have technology that would enable them to scan people for knives as they walk down a street. He told GB News:  We’re also investing, in the Home Office, in some new technology. It’s not ready for deployment yet but I’m hoping in about a year it will be. That will enable people to be scanned for knives as they walk down high streets to take more knives off the street.      9.45am GMT  Philp says he wants police to feel 'more confident' about using stop and search  In his morning interviews Chris Philp, the policing minister, said he wanted the police to feel “more confident” about using stop and search to tackle knife crime. He told BBC Breakfast:  I also want the police to be much more confident in using stop-and-search powers to stop people on the street when they’re suspected of carrying knives or drugs and performing a search …. More does need to done, that’s why from April we’re going to be really stepping up these hotspot patrols.  He also claimed that “some Labour politicians, like Sadiq Khan [the London mayor] in particular, I don’t think give the police the encouragement they need”.     9.24am GMT  Policing minister Chris Philp admits that previous crackdown on zombie knives contained obvious loophole  Good morning. Labour and the Conservatives are in a bidding war over knife crime today, with Keir Starmer announcing or re-announcing various plans to deal with the problem on the day when the Home Office is laying legislation before parliament to ban zombie-style knives. Pippa Crerar has the details here.   Related: Starmer vows that Labour will ‘get a grip’ on knife crime   You may think the government was meant to have banned them already. According to Labour, the government has made 16 announcements on this theme since 2015. But, as Chris Philp, the policing minister, admitted this morning, a previous crackdown contained a rather obvious loophole. When the government legislated to ban zombie knives, it defined them as blades having a cutting edge, a serrated edge and “images or words that suggest that it is to be used for the purpose of violence”. When the legislation came into force, manufacturers came up with a cunning ploy to get round the ban; they just left off the images or logos. When asked why the legislation contained such an obvious flaw, Philp told LBC:  I wasn’t responsible at the time. There was essentially a loophole where the knives that were banned in 2019 had to have threatening words or pictures on them … What happened then is the manufacturers responded by taking the words and pictures off … that, amongst other loopholes, is being closed.  When it was put to him that it should have been obvious manufacturers would do this, he replied:  That may be so. I can answer for what we’re doing now. This came to my attention and we’re fixing it today.  Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Morning: Keir Starmer is on a visit in Buckinghamshire. 10am: Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, gives evidence to the UK Covid inquiry in Edinburgh. Liz Lloyd, Nicola Sturgeon’s former chief of staff, follows him and Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, gives evidence at 2pm. 10.30am: Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, takes questions on next week’s business in the chamber. 11am: Mark Drakeford, the outgoing Welsh first minister, takes part in a Q&A at the Institute for Government thinktank. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 11.30am: Karen Bradley, the chair of the Commons procedure committee, makes a Commons statement on her committee’s proposal for David Cameron to be questioned by MPs in the chamber. Afternoon: Rishi Sunak is on a visit in Yorkshire. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature. You’ll see it just below the byline – on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a laptop or a desktop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos – no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.

        "content": "David Cameron breached “proper process” when he appointed Michelle Mone to the House of Lords in 2015, David Mundell, who was the Scotland secretary at the time, has said. Mundell, the Conservative MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, said Lord Cameron appointed Mone without Downing Street consulting the government’s Scotland Office, which is standard practice before awarding peerages to Scots. Cameron, recently appointed to the Lords himself, and other Westminster Tories had been impressed by Mone when she backed the union in the Scottish independence referendum. She was already well known in Scotland through her lingerie business, Ultimo. Mundell, who was the secretary of state for Scotland from 2015 to 2019, said some Scottish businesspeople were unhappy with Mone’s peerage, but he did not have an opportunity to discuss it until after Cameron had confirmed the appointment. “The peerage was a fait accompli by the time we heard about it,” Mundell said. “I was unhappy that the proper process was not followed and that the Scotland Office was not asked to provide any background or input. And I wasn’t at all surprised to find that Scottish businesses were very, very unhappy about the appointment. “I did communicate with Downing Street that Scottish business figures were unhappy because they did not consider Michelle Mone to be a substantial businesswoman.” Shortly before giving her a peerage in August 2015, Cameron made Mone his “entrepreneurship tsar”, and she was appointed to lead a review for Iain Duncan Smith, then the work and pensions minister, on supporting people in deprived areas to set up businesses. The government’s announcement described her as a “leading entrepreneur and businesswomen [sic]”. Later the same month, Cameron made her a Conservative life peer in his 2015 dissolution honours list, the official citation describing her as a “leading entrepreneur”. The peerage, carrying the title Baroness Mone of Mayfair, was controversial at the time and the subject of outspoken criticism by some Scottish businesspeople. Douglas Anderson, the managing director of the Glasgow-based plant hire company Gap Group, gave his views in strong terms in a letter to Cameron after reading initial press reports that a peerage was being considered. Anderson pointed out that published financial accounts of the Ultimo company showed it had been making losses and been in financial difficulties, and that in 2013 it had been rescued by a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, MAS Holdings. “Ms Mone is not a successful entrepreneur, she is a small-time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success,” Anderson wrote. “Awarding her a peerage for a very mediocre business performance brings the awarding of titles into disrepute by rewarding failure.” A spokesperson for Mone said she “came from a working-class family in Glasgow’s East End and worked hard to become a successful entrepreneur, building one of the biggest independent lingerie brands in the world”. She was “proud of her achievements”, the spokesperson added. “Michelle was honoured to be asked to join the House of Lords by David Cameron after her role in the Scottish referendum campaign. Her appointment was duly vetted by Holac [the House of Lords appointments commission] at the time.”  Interactive  Holac’s role is to vet people nominated as peers “for propriety”, and can withhold support if there are legal or regulatory issues, such as an outstanding tax investigation. Cameron did not respond to an invitation to comment. A Cabinet Office spokesperson pointed out that all peerages were vetted by Holac. Mone, 52, with her husband, Doug Barrowman, 58, is facing a National Crime Agency investigation into the procurement of £203m of government PPE contracts during the Covid pandemic for PPE Medpro. Both now admit involvement in the company but deny any wrongdoing. The PPE Medpro contracts were awarded in 2020 via the government’s “VIP lane” for politically connected people, including Tory peers, after Mone approached the Cabinet Office ministers Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew, offering to supply personal protective equipment."

        "content": "Britain’s next government faces some of the toughest tax and spending choices for generations as it will be forced to grapple with the impact of weak growth and high debt interest payments, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that Jeremy Hunt’s much-predicted budget tax cuts risked being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to “level” with voters before polling day. Launching the IFS’s work programme for an expected autumn general election, the thinktank said the victorious party would have a “thorny” inheritance. “Living standards have endured an unprecedentedly long stagnation. Taxes are at record levels for the UK (though remain low to middling by European standards). Public services are showing visible signs of strain and are, in many cases, performing less well than they were in 2010,” the report said.   Related: UK economy shrinks unexpectedly as households feel squeeze   Falling inflation and lower market interest rates have improved the short-term outlook for the public finances and provided Hunt with the scope for a giveaway package worth around £20bn. But the IFS said the chancellor needed to spell out what taxes would rise in the future or specify which services currently supplied by the state would be axed. “Further tax rises and further cuts for most public services are built into current plans. But on official forecasts, this is only just enough to stabilise government debt as a fraction of national income,” the report said. The thinktank said the challenges facing the next government were made more acute because a slow-growing economy would generate less in tax, and interest payments on the UK’s £2.7tn national debt would account for 9% of revenues on average across the next parliament. Both the Conservatives and Labour have promised to reduce debt as a share of national income – which stands at just under 98% – but the IFS said this would be more difficult than at any time since the 1950s and would involve trade-offs. These included:  A large cut to public investment over the rest of the decade, which would still fall even if Labour’s planned spending on its green prosperity plan was taken into account. Tough funding constraints, with concentration of spending on priority areas such as the NHS, schools and defence, implying cuts of £20bn in other unprotected departments. Plans by both parties to cut net migration to the UK had implications for the social care and higher education sectors, and neither party had talked about the higher care costs or the higher tuition fees for domestic students that would result from cutting numbers. Progress towards achieving net zero had involved picking most of the low-hanging fruit and the next steps – such as reducing emissions from buildings – would involve short-term costs on businesses and consumers. Spending on disability benefits was rising fast and required urgent attention, but previous efforts to rein in spending had struggled to achieve the stated objectives, while any general promises to cut spending would need to be accompanied by specific details as to who would lose out.  The IFS said that unlike wars and pandemics, the challenges facing an incoming government were predictable, but could not be dealt with by a government that ignored reality and the need to choose from competing options. The thinktank’s director, Paul Johnson, said: “Now more than ever, as a country, we face some big decisions and trade-offs over what we want the state to do and how we’re going to pay for it. Those looking to form the next government should be honest about these trade-offs. “If they are promising tax cuts, let’s hear where the spending cuts will fall. If they are going to raise, or even protect, spending, they should tell us where taxes will rise. Or parties might think that further increases in government debt are justified, in which case they should make the argument for why debt should be rising. “If to govern is to choose, then to campaign should be to present clear choices and trade-offs to the electorate. If the parties don’t do that clearly and honestly over the next year, we at IFS will do what we can to plug that gap.”"

        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s former special adviser is working with a group of rebels trying to oust the prime minister and helped commission polling which predicted a landslide Labour victory, according to reports. Will Dry, who worked as an adviser at Downing Street, quit in November last year after becoming “dispirited” by the direction being taken by Sunak, the Times reported. Since leaving No 10, he has been working with a group of former government advisers and MPs who believe the Tories “are heading for the most almighty of defeats” in the forthcoming general election under Sunak. In a statement published on X by the Sun’s political editor, Harry Cole, Dry said: “Everyone in the country can see just how colossal the challenges we face are. Sadly, it became clear to me we weren’t providing the bold, decisive action to overcome those challenges. “You cannot dent them without internalising how just how fundamentally broken our political system is.” Dry, 26, helped to draw up questions for a recent YouGov poll of 14,000 people commissioned by unnamed Tory donors, calling themselves the Conservative Britain Alliance (CBA) grouping. The poll reported that the Conservatives are heading for an electoral wipeout on the scale of their 1997 defeat by Labour. Dry added: “I further concluded, again sorrowfully, that the Conservatives are heading for the most almighty of defeats. Be in no doubt: we are on course for at least a decade of Labour rule. “And if [Nigel] Farage comes back, the Conservative party won’t exist by Christmas.” The polling, set out in the Daily Telegraph, was presented by Conservative peer and former Brexit negotiator David Frost, with the estimated £70,000 cost covered by the previously unknown CBA. Under British Polling Council guidelines, all polls have to say who commissioned them. However, it needs only a name to be contacted – in this case Lord Frost – and does not need to specify who paid for the work. Dry’s comments follow a call by Simon Clarke, who was a cabinet minister in Liz Truss’s short-lived government, for Sunak to quit and make way for a new Tory leader. In an opinion piece for the Telegraph, published online on Tuesday evening, Clarke said Sunak’s “uninspiring leadership is the main obstacle to our recovery” and that he has “sadly gone from asset to anchor”. Clarke argued that Sunak “is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred” because “he does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.”"

        "content": "Labour will use its sold-out business conference next week to unveil the party’s City policy plans, the Guardian can reveal, as it tries to win over hundreds of UK executives before a general election. More than 500 bosses from across British finance will gather in London on 1 February for the event, where opposition leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, plan to “showcase Labour’s offer to business”. The party is hoping that the conference – which sold out within two hours in the autumn – will demonstrate its “commitment to work hand in glove with the business community” and will use it as an opportunity to reveal its business policy plans after two major industry reviews. The Guardian understands that will include Labour’s much-anticipated strategy for the City and will detail how the party plans to harness the strength of the UK’s £275bn financial and professional services sector. Reeves and the shadow City minister, Tulip Siddiq, revealed in December that they had appointed a panel of 10 independent grandees from the world of finance – including Barclays chair Nigel Higgins and London Stock Exchange Group chief David Schwimmer – to guide its approach to the City, which accounts for about 12% of the UK economy. However, work had begun months earlier, when Labour seconded staff from the consultancy Oliver Wyman to gather views from more than 80 industry bodies, including TheCityUK, UK Finance, and British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, as well as consumer groups and charities. Siddiq is now expected to reveal the findings and policy plans at a breakfast meeting with City bosses on Thursday next week, which will cover financial regulation in areas such as buy now, pay later, and plans to boost gender and ethnic diversity across the sector. It is likely to break down its announcement into five key themes: capital markets, competitiveness, consumer protection, innovation and sustainability. However, Labour’s approach to more controversial issues, including a previously mooted move to scrap discounted tax rates for “carried interest” in the private equity industry, were not “in scope” of the City review, according to sources. Carried interest refers to the share of profits that private equity fund managers make on successful deals. Dealmakers now pay 28% capital gains tax on those profits, nearly half of the 45% income tax levied on higher earners. Labour had pledged in 2021 to scrap the tax loophole, which is believed to benefit about 2,000 private equity bankers across the UK. Meanwhile, the shadow business minister is expected to reveal how the party intends to boost the voice of small businesses after a review by lobbyist Iain Anderson, a former adviser to Boris Johnson, who defected from the Tory party in 2023. Anderson had been asked to draft a plan for how Labour should engage with smaller firms, to ensure they were not sidelined by engagement with big business and unions. “This is about everybody getting an ability to make a pitch,” Anderson told the Financial Times in October. Labour’s conference – the location of which has yet to be unveiled for security reasons – will be held more than a month before Jeremy Hunt’s spring budget on 6 March, giving the opposition some lead time before the chancellor announces initiatives that the Conservatives hope will appeal to business and voters. Labour was approached for comment. "

        "content": "Conservative MPs have rallied around Rishi Sunak as a former minister who called for him to quit said he felt he was shouting “iceberg” on the Titanic. Sir Simon Clarke was roundly criticised by Tory colleagues for writing that Sunak should be replaced as party leader in a scathing opinion piece in the Telegraph. One Tory MP from the 2019 intake said Clarke, 39, who was housing secretary in Liz Truss’s short-lived administration, should lose the whip for undermining the PM in an election year. “He’s a tosser,” they said, and referred to other recent articles in the paper. “A guy out for revenge for the failed Truss experiment relying on a single Telegraph poll which was paid for by Rishi’s enemies to discredit him.” Tobias Ellwood, the former defence minister, said: “It’s been interesting how his comments have prompted an impressive rally of support for the PM and against Clarke. I suspect this may deter others from following such a reckless call for yet another leadership campaign.” In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Clarke, knighted in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours, likened himself to someone shouting “iceberg” as the Titanic heads towards disaster. “I totally respect the strong views that something like this evokes,” he said. “No one likes that guy that’s shouting ‘iceberg’ but I suspect that people will be even less happy if we hit the iceberg. “And we are on course to do that … I don’t want a decade of decline under [Keir] Starmer. I really worry that we’re on course for a shattering course.” In a particularly humiliating development, Clarke has been removed from an event to launch a free-market Conservative group he had worked on alongside Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg. A source close to Truss said Clarke would no longer be appearing at the launch event of Popular Conservatism on 6 February.  Tory MPs from all wings of the party joined in to criticise Clarke on Wednesday. There was not a single message in support of him on the Conservative MPs’ WhatsApp group, according to one source. Kwasi Kwarteng, who was Truss’s chancellor, told Times Radio: “I don’t agree with Simon … I think to change the leadership now, without a general election, would be very unwise. “It was an odd intervention. The thing that struck me is that I think every single person, and there have been lots of people, have really jumped on him and said: ‘What are you doing? Get behind the leader. You’re not speaking for the vast majority of people in the party.’ He’s very much a lone voice on this.” Another Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, told Times Radio that Clarke should “keep quiet”. Sunak was greeted by particularly loud cheers from his backbenchers as he entered the Commons for prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. Starmer accused Sunak of “endlessly fighting with his own MPs”. “We have seen this story time and time again with this lot, party first, country second,” the Labour leader said. Asked afterwards what his message was to Tory MPs who are calling for his resignation, Sunak’s press secretary replied: “What, Simon Clarke?”   Related: Faithless Tories feign loyalty to Rish! with all the plausibility of a Nadine Dorries story   On being reminded that one other MP, Andrea Jenkyns, had urged Sunak to go, she said: “They are both known critics. That is their view. Clearly, lots of other Conservative MPs disagree with them.” The regular 1922 Committee meeting of backbench Tory MPs ended after just 15 minutes. Asked if Clarke was there, one MP asked sarcastically: “Who?” Another said that if Clarke had come, “we would have had tar and feathers ready”. Some Tory MPs privately agree with Clarke’s criticisms of Sunak but think that the idea of replacing him is fanciful. One former minister said: “This is unwise as there is no alternative plan.” Clarke’s intervention has raised further questions about a major YouGov poll that was commissioned by a shadowy group called the “Conservative Britain Alliance” and published with great fanfare in the Telegraph last week. After asking those surveyed initially who they would favour between Starmer and Sunak, the poll then asked voters to carry out a “hypothetical thought experiment” where they chose between Starmer and a new Conservative leader who is tough on migration, cuts taxes for working people and gets NHS waiting lists down.  YouGov published a clarification of its methodology on Wednesday after criticism, including from Manchester politics professor, Rob Ford, who called it “one of the worst poll questions I’ve ever seen”. It is not known who paid for the polling. In his piece, Clarke argued that Sunak “is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred” because “he does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.”"

        "content": "Downing Street wants to give UK families higher priority for social housing in a controversial scheme that will be badged as “British homes for British workers”, the Guardian can reveal. Officials will launch a consultation in the coming weeks into how they can give British citizens faster access to social housing, a move designed in part to bolster Rishi Sunak’s reputation for being tough on immigration. But the move has prompted anger from some in government, who warn it could further fuel support for the rightwing Reform UK party. Housing experts say it is likely to be either illegal or unworkable, or both. Polly Neate, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: “This policy amounts to nothing more than scapegoating at its worst. It is unnecessary, unenforceable and unjust. Not only does it ignore the fact that there are already stringent rules so only UK citizens or those with settled status can access homes for social rent, but it blames a group of people for a housing emergency that they did not create.” Advisers to the prime minister originally wanted to include a “British homes for British workers” bill in the king’s speech, but decided instead to focus on reform of the rental and leasehold markets – both priorities of the housing secretary, Michael Gove. In recent weeks, however, the prime minister has been buffeted by polls showing his party heading for a defeat on the scale of 1997, as well a high-profile call for his resignation from a former cabinet colleague, Simon Clarke. He also faces a bruising confrontation with members of the House of Lords over his bill to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. With N0 10 looking for ways to boost the party’s ratings on immigration, officials are looking again at the “British homes for British workers” scheme, and are planning to release a consultation early next month setting out its options. Under current rules, local housing authorities are meant to decide social housing allocation based on need, giving priority to those who are homeless or living in overcrowded or squalid conditions. Refugees are allowed to claim social housing, but anyone who is not entitled to benefits is not, meaning most foreigners in the UK are already excluded. The latest government figures show that 90% of the lead tenants in social housing are British citizens. In certain areas, however, that figure is much lower. In the London borough of Brent, 40% of new social homes were let to foreign nationals in 2021-22, while in Southwark the figure was 29%. Under changes introduced under Gordon Brown’s government, housing providers trying to choose between two households of roughly equivalent need should take into account how long they have lived in the area or whether they have local family connections. Those changes were criticised at the time for equating to “British homes for British workers”, but those under consideration by the current government are expected to go further. Since then, pressure on social housing has increased hugely thanks to a sharp drop in new housing supply. Nearly 40,000 new socially rented properties were added to the market in England in 2010-11, but by 2022-23 that figure had dropped to 9,561. The relative lack of social housing, coupled with record immigration levels, has left ministers looking for a way to prioritise British people on the waiting lists. One option would be to discriminate on the basis of nationality, but such a move is likely to fall foul of equalities law. A more plausible change would be to bar refugees from gaining access to social housing, but this would be controversial given that those who have successfully been given refugee status are supposed to be allowed full access to social benefits. Those who have come to the UK under the Ukrainian or Afghan resettlement schemes are likely to be protected, however, sources said. Ministers could also seek to strengthen the rules introduced by the Brown government so that people have to show they have stronger or longer connections to an area before being given priority for housing. Neate said: “For decades, we’ve lost more social homes than we’ve built, leaving us with a huge shortage and condemning homeless families to years on a waiting list with no hope of a stable home. If the government wants to do something that would genuinely tackle the housing emergency, there’s a clear solution – we need to build 90,000 social homes a year.” The plan was due to be announced this week, but was postponed at the last minute after some officials warned that it would look bad to do so in the same week that Grenfell Tower victims were testifying about their experiences. No 10 instead wants to push ahead with the announcement early next month, though it is unclear which minister will be placed in charge. Some in government believe, however, that any policy proposals are unlikely to be implemented in time for the election. “This looks like a piece of electioneering more than anything else,” said one government source. Downing Street declined to comment on “policy speculation”."
