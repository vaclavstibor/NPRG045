        "content": "More than a decade before an AI-powered chatbot could do your homework, help you make dinner or pass the bar exam, there was @Horse_ebooks. The primitive predecessor to today’s chatbot renaissance began as a Twitter account in 2010, tweeting automated excerpts from ebooks that, decontextualized, took on unexpected and strangely poetic meanings.   Related:  ‘Drama magnet’: Elon Musk’s biggest headlines of 2023   Purportedly a spambot, the account surfaced quotes from ebooks that went viral for their absurdist fragments – phrases like “Hello saxophone,” “COULD THIS BE THE”, and “Today we are lucky to be talking”. It amassed more than 200,000 followers at its peak and now, despite being inactive for a decade, the account still holds 131,000 followers. Its most memorable quip – “everything happens so much” – still resonates today. In 2013, it was revealed that real-life human being Jacob Bakkila had been responsible for tweets from the account for the preceding two years. The New York City artist purchased @Horse_ebooks from an actual spammer in 2012 and then simulated its “speech” – tweeting excerpts from books at random intervals and “performing” as the bot 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “My goal was to reverse engineer how the bot approached things on the internet,” Bakkila said. “Nothing that @Horse_ebooks tweeted – either when it was an actual automated spam bot, or when it was myself – was ever written originally. It was always pulled from previously written text.” By reusing and repurposing existing writing, the account functioned similarly to today’s more advanced chatbots, albeit on a smaller scale. Language learning models, the technology upon which apps like ChatGPT is built, work by crawling large troves of human writing, analyzing patterns in human speech and spitting back that speech to the user based on context clues. “I wanted to draw on the tension of authorship, both between myself and the fact that it was originally a literal spam bot. When does the bot end and when does the human begin?” Bakkila said.    It’s still just taking language that humans previously wrote and giving it back to humans   That question has never been more relevant, as people increasingly use AI-powered chatbots not just as an alternative to Google, but as therapists and friends. AI companies are also under legal threat for their use of existing writing, with authors accusing them of unfairly and illegally using copyrighted works. The Guardian spoke with Bakkila about human-robot authorship, the alleged AI apocalypse and what the popularity of his spam bot art project means in our modern times. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. @Horse_ebooks is one of the first examples I can remember of a language-based bot the public meaningfully engaged with in such a viral way – what are your thoughts on this new bot-based artificial intelligence boom we are seeing? I think you flatter me too much when you say it was the first. @Horse_ebooks itself was inspired by a variety of things – most notably earlier models, all the way back to what almost any older millennial will remember – SmarterChild and other early AOL Instant Messenger bots. This idea of automated language is certainly not a new concept. That said, obviously, the sophistication has grown enormously. It’s important to remember that we are still fundamentally just pulling from pre-established corpuses of work. It’s still just taking language that humans previously wrote and giving it back to humans. So in that sense, even with the enormous variety of sophistication, my understanding is that it’s still humans talking to humans, with a bot as the intermediary. I’m curious if you have any thoughts on the evolution of AI and chatbots. They used to hallucinate a lot more, their language was a little bit more simple – as they improve, do you think that impacts the experience?   Related: New York Times sues OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement    We’ve always foisted human-like traits onto machinery – probably ever since we invented the first machines. People talk to the Roombas as though they are pets. We have AI speakers or smart speakers we are encouraged to talk to as though it’s a normal human conversation. When things break, when things glitch, when things go haywire there’s always a beautiful moment of peeking behind the curtain – understanding and reminding yourself that it is just a machine. With ChatGPT, there was an initial surge of people seeing what they could get ChatGPT to do, and what it couldn’t do. Invariably, there’s the sine wave of new technology, with people having fun and exploiting it and using it in ways that the people who built it did not anticipate. Then those loopholes get closed and the bugs get squashed, and some of the fun disappears. But people find other ways to use it, again in ways that are counterintuitive and funny and artistically meaningful. From an artist’s standpoint, what do you think about the integration of AI into the art world? It’s an issue that has obviously been controversial. I would agree that it’s been controversial, but, like so many things, it might be a little bit of a tempest in a teacup. We live in a time when hot takes are very valuable to people. And there are plenty of people having fun with AI in ways that are interesting and counterintuitive. It remains to be seen how permanent AI is. Talk to me a year from now, a lot of this could fade, people are already predicting that we’ve reached or are near the height of sophistication for things like language models. The problem with any new type of technology is that, as humans we have a tendency to assume an asymptotic growth. We think, “Wow, this is incredible – I bet it’s going to be 100 times as incredible 10 months from now.” Sometimes that happens, sometimes it doesn’t.   There are definitely some things about the internet now that are more pernicious and more volatile than they’ve ever been before   I feel like something’s been awoken in me at the mention of SmarterChild – I completely forgot about that. Yes, I don’t want to guess how old you are, but I imagine you’re younger than I am – what was your screen name on AOL? Mine is humiliating – it was PV – because my school was called Pleasant Valley – frog lover, because I loved frogs. That’s wonderful, really. There’s an innocence and a wonder in the names that we assigned ourselves in those earlier eras of the internet. I believe it still exists now with kids and preteens and teens going on things like Roblox. The song remains the same, but the fidelity at which it is played has changed. It’s interesting to look at it from that perspective – obviously there’s so much nefariousness about the internet, but there is also an innocence in some parts of it, and people having fun with it. Do you think that still exists within AI, or do you think it’s as scary as people say? That’s a great question and it really depends on who you ask. There are definitely some things about the internet now that are more pernicious and more volatile than they’ve ever been before – I don’t want to downplay that. But when it comes to people just having fun and experimenting and making things with the tools given them, I don’t think it is appreciably different than it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago. People who forecast too much doom and gloom have a tendency to be wrong. Maybe that’s just my optimistic nature.   Related: Rite Aid facial recognition misidentified Black, Latino and Asian people as ‘likely’ shoplifters   There have been a lot of changes to online platforms since @Horse_ebooks was around – what do you think of the changes to Twitter’s character limit? Back then, there was a 140-character limit on tweets, so it meant the bot would post text that would sometimes be cut off. I adhered to that religiously, and it meant that truncated text was something that you could work with very interestingly. One of the more unexplored aspects of the world as it exists today is that we have such an abundance of information that very few people work counter to that. There are very few comparative mysteries anymore and because information is so freely available. And brevity is rare. I think less is always more when it comes to these types of brief communications. It’s interesting that through your performance, you were seeking to replicate a bot whereas AI bots are predominantly thought to be seeking to replicate human behavior. What do you think of that? I would caution with the word replicate, because that’s the difficult part – are we trying to replicate? Are we attempting to imitate? Are we attempting to supplant? I wouldn’t disagree with you that, in shorthand, I was attempting to carbon copy the bot’s process. But I believe my intentions were different. I wasn’t making any kickbacks from the sale of ebooks. That said, there’s also the tension of the Turing test – if a human can’t tell whether or not it’s talking to a bot or a human, does it matter? In general I think people who are using AI in interesting ways right now are not doing so in an attempt to seek attention or or galvanize either opposition or support. They’re just trying to think, what can I do with AI? It’s incredible to think of what you’d be able to do right now. We are becoming something altogether larger than ourselves – and that is where you can find a very interesting tension because it brings up that age-old question, what does it mean to be human? And of course, we’re no closer to an answer – we are probably further than ever before. But we’ve never been able to ask it so interestingly. I’m sure you get asked this a lot, but why do you think @Horse_ebooks was so resonant with people? I can’t say why, but I’m always flattered when I get asked about it. A friend recently pointed out there is a variety of Spotify playlists that use probably my most famous combination of words: “everything happens so much”. Can you remember where that phrase came from? It came from a local information product – but then again, did I write it? No. It came from a book about retirement, something like “everything happens so much faster when you’re retired”. We’re all fascinated with things on the internet that we don’t understand and this is the heart of why people are drawn to new technology. I also find it interesting that in the case of @Horse_ebooks, people felt disappointed or betrayed or something to find out that a human was involved with tweets that they were seeing. Now, it seems like with AI, it’s become the reverse – people are disappointed to find out when something was made by a bot or an AI – do you think that has changed? I actually think that, like many other technological changes that happen in culture, most people have a pretty good eye right now for text and imagery that has been generated. You see it coming from a mile away. I think that speaks also to how much we read. In the modern era, even if we don’t consciously think of it as reading, so many of us are in front of screens close to every waking moment. The average person has a great degree of sophistication in terms of separating the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. With all the new technology, is there ever a world in which @Horse_ebooks is resurrected as a new bot? @Horse_ebooks was a piece that was designed to be an endurance piece and a piece of performance poetry. And in that sense, when a piece is done, a piece is done. I don’t like to retread old territory."

        "content": "A chief executive officer whose claimed qualifications appear to have no basis in fact was used to promote the HyperVerse crypto fund, alongside celebrity messages of support, as part of a push to recruit new investors into the scheme.\nA Guardian Australia investigation last month revealed thousands of people have lost millions of dollars to the HyperVerse crypto scheme, which was promoted by the Australian entrepreneur Sam Lee and his business partner, Ryan Xu, two of the founders of the collapsed Australian bitcoin company Blockchain Global.\nBlockchain Global owes creditors $58m and its liquidator has referred Xu and Lee to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for alleged possible breaches of the Corporations Act. Asic has said it does not intend to take action at this time.\nThe HyperVerse investment scheme is among those that appear to have escaped scrutiny in Australia despite being flagged by regulators overseas, by one as a possible “scam” and another as a “suspected pyramid scheme”.\n\n Related: Investors lose millions as crypto schemes operate unchecked in Australia \n\nLee has denied HyperVerse was a scam and disputes being its founder. Guardian Australia has not been able to contact Xu for comment.\nA man named Steven Reece Lewis was introduced as the chief executive officer of HyperVerse at an online global launch event in December 2021, with video messages of support from a clutch of celebrities released on Twitter the following month, including from the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and actor Chuck Norris.\nPromotional material released for HyperVerse, which was linked to a previous scheme called HyperFund, said Reece Lewis was a graduate of the University of Leeds and held a master’s degree from the University of Cambridge. A brief career summary of Reece Lewis, which was presented in a video launch for potential investors, said he had worked for Goldman Sachs, sold a web development company to Adobe and launched an IT start-up firm, before being recruited to head up HyperVerse by the HyperTech group. This was the umbrella organisation for a range of Hyper-branded crypto schemes.\nLee spoke at the launch event as “chairman” of the HyperTech group, while Xu was introduced as the group’s “founder”.\nThe company praised Reece Lewis’s “strong performance and drive”, citing his credentials as the reason for his recruitment.\nGuardian Australia has confirmed that neither the University of Leeds nor the University of Cambridge has any record of someone by the name Steven Reece Lewis on their databases.\nNo records exist of Steven Reece Lewis on the UK companies register, Companies House, or on the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAdobe, a publicly listed company since 1986, has no record of any acquisition of a company owned by a Steven Reece Lewis in any of its public SEC filings.\nIt is understood that Goldman Sachs could find no record of Reece Lewis having worked for the company.\nGuardian Australia was unable to find a LinkedIn profile for Reece Lewis or any internet presence other than HyperVerse promotional material.\nA Twitter account in Reece Lewis’s name was set up a month before he appeared in the HyperVerse video launch and was used to promote the scheme on the platform for just six months before the account became inactive.\nCelebrity support\nHyperVerse was promoted at the launch event as a new digital metaverse that would rival Facebook, where members could explore “the new frontier of a galactic universe and bring to life a complete virtual world”.\nIn the video, Reece Lewis encouraged people to become early supporters of HyperVerse, saying the company would “create a parallel system of existence that will change how people live, how we interact with people around the world, and even how companies and corporations will conduct business”.\n“This metaverse race has just started so I do strongly urge everyone to join us as an early backer and supporter of this foray into the metaverse era,” he said.\n \n\n\n\nInvestors were offered “memberships” to the HyperVerse, which was a “blockchain community” that allowed members to “explore the HyperVerse ecosystem”.\nThe minimum membership amount was $300USD, which was converted to HyperUnits once invested.\nThe scheme offered minimum returns of 0.5% a day, with a 300% return over 600 days.\nMembers were incentivised to “reinvest” their earnings, with more HyperUnits offered if funds were not withdrawn once they became available.\nMembers were also paid HyperUnits to recruit new members, with referral commissions paid on a sliding scale according to how many people were recruited. Further commissions were paid based on how many people these recruits then recruited, down to 20 levels.\nHyperUnits were linked to various crypto tokens and once matured could be withdrawn and converted to other cryptocurrencies.\nWhile early investors profited and were able to make withdrawals, the scheme has left many investors unable to access their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n“In fact I believe we have done all the research needed, and we are poised to launch something that can truly shine in the years to come.”\nInvestors in HyperVerse were able to buy “memberships” with minimum returns of 0.5% a day, with a 300% return over 600 days. Incentives were also offered for recruiting new members.\nThe launch video included a five-minute presentation near the beginning from a HyperVerse “compliance officer” on the terms and conditions of becoming a member, saying it was a “globally compliant company”, while warning that there was a “risk of loss” for those involved.\n\n Related: ‘They are so convincing’: Vera Gazzard lost her life savings to HyperVerse \n\nA report from the US-based blockchain analysts Chainalysis estimates consumer losses to HyperVerse in 2022 amounted to US$1.3bn ($1.92bn).\nFollowing the online launch the company released video messages of support from celebrities on the Reece Lewis Twitter account, including Wozniak, Norris, comedian Jim Norton and boy band singer Lance Bass.\nIt is unclear how these messages of support were obtained, but all four celebrities are available to hire through the website Cameo, which allows people to pay high-profile individuals to read out a script for them, for anything from a birthday greeting to a business marketing video.\nThe Norris “shout out” to HyperVerse states that “under the leadership of CEO Steven, HyperVerse will be the leader of metaverse space”.\nWozniak said: “I’m here to support Steven and HyperVerse” and “I can’t wait for the HyperVerse”.\n \n\n   default\n  \n\n\nNorton described HyperVerse as a “decentralised metaverse platform with infinite possibilities” and encouraged people to sign up. “I strongly believe Steven will lead HyperVerse to success. Let’s all join the HyperVerse. What are you waiting for? Do it now.”\nThe video messages of support were released in January 2022 as HyperVerse was ramping up its global recruitment drive.\nGuardian Australia contacted Wozniak, Norris, Norton and Bass for comment but received no reply. There is no suggestion they had any knowledge of HyperVerse’s business model when filming the messages of support and they make no reference to money or investments. \n‘The problem is I’m not involved’\nSome HyperVerse members said they faced problems withdrawing funds from the scheme in the first half of 2022, with members saying they were then encouraged to migrate to a new platform called HyperNation. A May 2022 launch event video for HyperNation broadcast on YouTube featured masked promoters called “Mr H” and “Miss N”. Reece Lewis did not feature and was not referred to in the video.\n“Mr H” described himself in the video as an “evangelist in the new world order” and he and “Miss N” were presented as the “official ambassadors of HyperNation”.\nIn the presentation, “Mr H” talked about the failure of neoliberalism and said HyperNation would use new technologies to provide “citizens of HyperNation” with a universal basic income.\n“I thought I was destined to live a meaningless life but not any more,” he said. “As a citizen in HyperNation I feel liberated and free; I can have full autonomy over my finances with the help of decentralised finance, and best of all my self-worth is no longer determined by anyone else.”\nLee and Xu did not feature in the HyperNation launch video and were not mentioned.\nIn a subsequent Zoom meeting with HyperNation members, a senior promoter of both HyperVerse and HyperNation was asked how HyperNation was associated with the original HyperTech schemes.\nThe promoter said the company was “one big entity”.\n“[It is] one big entity where you’ve got HyperVerse and HyperNation, which is a new entity within the same setup,” he said in a Zoom meeting in early 2022 about the launch of HyperNation.\nThis individual promoter lists himself on his LinkedIn profile as a “VIP5 STAR” for the HyperCommunity, which was the highest ranking available, based on how many people he recruited into the HyperVerse scheme.\nWhen Lee was asked directly about his involvement with HyperNation in a Zoom meeting with investors in January 2023, he denied being involved and suggested that he had only worked on the funds management and technology side of the Hyper schemes.\n“In terms of HyperNation … the problem is I’m not involved so I don’t really have that much else to say that could give you visibility of who Mr H is,” Lee said.\nLee did not respond to questions from the Guardian about his involvement in the establishment and operation of HyperFund and HyperVerse before the publication of the previous Guardian Australia article.\nIn a WhatsApp message after the article was published he alleged it included “misstatements” about his role in running the Hyper schemes, but did not respond when asked what they were. He also claimed that “people on the internet continues [sic] to make things up”.\nHe did not respond to further emailed questions that sought to clarify his involvement in HyperNation, or to questions about Reece Lewis.\nIn further WhatsApp messages, Lee said: “There is no shortage of angry people saying I should have done more, but I’m not a public person and continue to be disturbed by people threating [sic] me for the mistakes they made.”\nReece Lewis’s identity could not be verified by the Guardian, nor could he be contacted for comment.\n• If you are feeling overwhelmed or need financial help, call the national debt helpline on 1800 007 007\n• Do you know more?

        "content": "A Dutch manufacturer has cancelled shipments of hi-tech microchip machinery to China after pressure from the US government, it has been reported. ASML, a key firm in the global semiconductor manufacturing supply chain, was due to export three chip-making machines to China but had its export licences revoked by the Dutch government before they were shipped. The company is one of the only manufacturers of extreme ultraviolet lithography systems (EUVs), which use lasers to help create the circuits for chips. The advanced technology is used by leading chip producers such as Samsung and Intel, which are then used in products ranging from smartphones to sophisticated military equipment. Bloomberg reported that ASML decided to cancel the shipment of some of its most advanced machines after a request was made by the Biden administration. However, a later statement from the company said that a licence for the shipment of two types of lithography machines had been “partially revoked” by the Dutch government, and would affect a “small number of customers” in China. It added: “In recent discussions with the US government, ASML has obtained further clarification of the scope and impact of the US export control regulations.” The pressure from the US comes as the country seeks to limit China’s ability to expand its semiconductor knowledge and production, urging allies to restrict technology associated with the manufacturing of semiconductors. The Biden administration brought in new restrictions last October to try to block non-US firms exporting semiconductor chips and lithography machines that contain US-made parts and technology. In July last year, the Dutch government agreed to put restrictions on sales of ASML’s deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines, the second most advanced it produces, after pressure from the US. The restrictions came in officially on Monday. Responding to the most recent blocking of the ASML orders, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin urged the Netherlands “to be impartial, respect market principles and the law, take practical actions to protect the common interests of both countries and their companies and maintain the stability of international supply chains”. He added that the action by the US to encourage the move was “hegemonic and bullying behaviour”. ASML said it did not expect the revocation of the licence to have a “material impact” on its financial outlook for 2023."

        "content": "I spent my teen years baring my soul on Blogger, Xanga, Friendster and Myspace, well before there was widespread acceptance and knowledge of the ways companies already did and would increasingly collect and share my data. The idea that there was no such thing as a free service and that, in fact, the cost of doing business with digital platforms is relinquishing control over your personal information is a relatively new one, and it’s too late for me. After years of being extremely online, there’s little hope left for me and my privacy on the internet.   Related: Revealed: how US immigration uses fake social media profiles across investigations   My yet-to-be-born son, on the other hand, has a squeaky-clean slate. His soon-to-be-mother is also a surveillance reporter, equipped with the knowledge of how few privacy protections we have online. I have been handed what has felt like both a unique opportunity and a daunting responsibility: managing and protecting my future child’s digital footprint. My wariness of the privacy ramifications of everything we do online is probably higher than most. But it’s been particularly horrifying to watch how quickly social media platforms figured out I was pregnant. I am pretty sure Instagram knew I was expecting before my mom did. Within days of taking four (yes, four) pregnancy tests and Googling questions like “how do I know if I’m really pregnant,” my Instagram Explore page started surfacing the good, the bad and the scary of the world of #Momstagram. Sponsored ads for companies like Babylist and dozens of products I never knew I needed started following me around and popping up between every few posts on my feed. It was more anxiety-inducing than helpful: six weeks is too early to begin researching and planning out the products I want to put on my baby registry. “10 things you SHOULD NEVER DO with a newborn” is not a helpful post when I’m just trying to figure out if I am actually pregnant. Having closely covered surveillance, it’s not a surprise to me that a cursory click or two on posts from prominent mom influencers could open the floodgates of targeted ads and content. Such is the insidious nature of ad tech surveillance: advertisers collect reams of data on you, me and everyone we know. That data then is stored and shared with other companies or government entities in such opaque ways that some companies admit to not being able to keep track of where it ends up themselves. And, for years, law enforcement has increasingly been making use of that data. I am, unfortunately, hyper-aware of the ways any pictures I post are fed into a data-hungry surveillance machine that may one day be used against me or my family. Therein lies a dilemma: I am still a millennial on the internet. I suffer from what I’ve come to affectionately call Posting Disease. Symptoms include an inability to experience most major life moments without documenting and posting pictures of them. It’s an affliction I expect will become more unmanageable when the days of having a cute little human loafing around my home arrive.   I have been handed what has felt like both a unique opportunity and a daunting responsibility: managing and protecting my future child’s digital footprint   I want to post pictures of my baby. It’s hard enough to resist sharing every memorable moment of my pregnancy like the 3D image of my son in my womb, covering his face and refusing to have his picture taken. (Take a hint, mom.) How can I be expected to not share when my son does something impossibly cute in the first few weeks of his life like lying in his crib, lying in his bouncer or lying on the floor?  Can a privacy girly ever really have it all? Several surveillance experts say “it depends”. There’s no way to completely protect your child’s privacy if you don’t live on a remote, internet-free island, according to Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (Stop). In most cities in the US, your kid’s image might be captured and shared by neighbors’ Ring devices, the baby’s daycare or CCTV cameras on the street. “So it really becomes a question of what types of harms are you trying to prevent,” Fox Cahn said. Different people with different vulnerabilities or priorities might have different threat models, he said. For instance, undocumented parents or parents who are in a custody battle might have more acute fears about revealing information about where they live, where their kids go to school and what parks they go to. Reducing access to location data on their phones and not sharing images that inadvertently reveal their most-frequently visited places might be one way of protecting themselves.   The more I look, the more it’s just a series of kind of unhappy choices  Nat Meysenburg    Thinking about my own future kid, my current threat model includes his Muslim mother who is a journalist. It’s a combination that might put me, and consequently my family, at higher risk of potential doxxing, hacking or surveillance because of my religion or what I report on. So my priorities include protecting information that might reveal our home address and the places we frequent, shielding my future son’s images from surveillance tech firms like Clearview AI, and keeping as much personal information about him off the internet for as long as possible.  What that looks like in practical terms, is of course, up to me, though it might not feel like there’s a real solution, according to Nat Meysenburg, a father of one and a technologist at New America’s Open Technology Institute, a thinktank. “The more I look, the more it’s just a series of kind of unhappy choices,” Meysenburg said. “There are definitely things, I’ve found that we can do [to protect our children’s privacy]. But I think that there’s a certain amount of resignation that I’ve come to having that this is the reality.” Meysenburg and his partner have operating principles that have worked so far. They don’t post pictures of their children’s faces on Facebook or Instagram. The pair also accept that they can’t always control every environment. Their kids are in a daycare that posts images of their children on Facebook. “Am I going to keep a kid out of daycare when I know they post on Facebook? The answer was, in fact, no. I was like, ‘OK, I can’t prevent this, and every daycare does this, and it was the only spot that we could find.’” While my husband and I have yet to make decisions about childcare, a close comparison for us is that it will probably be hard to limit what other family members share about our kid on Facebook or Instagram. While Muslims are accustomed to masking their children’s faces on social media to avoid evil eye – we are professionals at cropping, unafraid to throw a flower emoji on a kid’s face – that might not be the case for my non-Muslim family members and friends. Meysenburg also suggested using an encrypted-messaging platform, Signal, to share images with a close group of friends, rather than posting on social media. “The Signal group has at least scratched the itch of having an audience of people to give you likes and comments, which is what you really want,” he said. He’s right – that itch is the core of my Posting Disease. I want other people to coo over my future son; I can’t help it.   Parents should be listening to their kids and letting their kids control the extent to which their image is public  Nat Meysenburg    Even off social media, there’s the question of how and where to store the images of our kids. Meysenburg said Apple iCloud has felt secure enough for his family, given photos stored on it are encrypted and that Apple’s business model is less about monetizing user data than that of many other tech companies. Fox Cahn said he gets “very nervous” about relying on the service “since I don’t know how long their encryption promises will last if governments keep pushing back”. Apple has gone back and forth on whether to roll out photo-scanning software to iCloud, pitched as a means of detecting child sexual abuse material; the company most recently scrapped the plan after receiving pushback from privacy experts. Fox Cahn instead recommended a third party encrypted file-sharing service called Tresorit for storing photos. Then there are baby monitors – the idea of having a camera in my child’s room that connects to some external server fills me with deep anxiety. Who else is seeing this footage? Is someone going to hack the connection? But I also really want to be able to keep an eye on my kid while he’s sleeping – maybe even send a couple of snaps of the sleeping tot to grandma and grandpa. Meysenburg’s solution was to use a camera-based baby monitor without connecting it to the internet – something that requires a technical savvy I do not have, I must admit. When his family travels, Meysenburg uses an audio-only radio monitor, which, I’m increasingly realizing, might be my best option. My husband and I will need to make tradeoffs about how and what to share with the digital world and how much to expose our son to it. For instance, Fox Cahn doesn’t believe sharing pictures of milestones like birthdays on social media presents a huge threat to children’s futures for parents with fewer vulnerabilities. It’s more important to think about children’s agency in these decisions, he said: “Parents should be listening to their kids and letting their kids control the extent to which their image is public from as early an age as possible.” Will I be able to manage my Posting Disease until my son can tell me how he wants to be perceived by the digital world? Realistically, probably not. But until then, sharing only memorable moments rather than every waking and sleeping moment of my child’s early life might be a doable compromise."

        "content": "The social media platform X has lost 71% of its value since it was bought by Elon Musk, according to the mutual fund Fidelity. Fidelity, which owns a stake in X Holdings, said in a disclosure obtained by Axios that it had marked down the value of its shares by 71.5% since Musk’s purchase. Musk acquired Twitter for $44bn in October 2022 and renamed the platform X in July 2023. Fidelity’s estimate would place the value of X at about $12.5bn.   Related:  ‘Drama magnet’: Elon Musk’s biggest headlines of 2023   The number of monthly users of X dropped by 15% in the first year since Musk’s takeover amid concerns over a rise in hate speech on the platform. Since Musk’s takeover, X has cut at least 50% of staff and reduced moderation. And in September, the European Union issued a warning to Musk after it found that X had the highest ratio of disinformation posts of all large social media platforms. Fidelity’s revised valuation of X came from a disclosure which ran to the end of November 2023, Axios reported. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. That disclosure would cover the fallout from a number of major companies pulling advertising on X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, the New York Times reported. Musk responded to the boycott by telling companies to “go fuck yourself” during an interview at an event in New York. Musk is the world’s richest man, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $251bn. When he acquired Twitter, Musk said he was buying the company “to try to help humanity”. Since the takeover Musk has reinstated a number of people previously banned from the platform, including former president Donald Trump and the rightwing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Trump is facing more than 90 criminal charges stemming from subversion of the 2020 election that he lost to Joe Biden, retention of government secrets after his presidency and hush-money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels. He is also attempting to fend off civil lawsuits over business affairs and a rape allegation deemed substantially true by a judge. Meanwhile, Jones recently proposed to pay $55m over 10 years to the Sandy Hook families who sued him for spreading lies that the 2012 schoolhouse killings in Newtown, Connecticut, were part of a hoax meant to force the US to accept gun control. Jones’s offer came after a Texas judge ruled that Jones, the host of Infowars, could not invoke bankruptcy protection to avoid paying the nearly $1.5bn he was ordered to pay to families of the victims of one of the deadliest school shootings in US history. Believers of Jones’s lies aimed abuse and threats at the families."

        "content": "Partway through 2023, I caught up with a respected, high-ranking tech writer at another publication. We gossiped and nattered, and, a bit exasperated, empathised with each other: we were run ragged. The last two years have raised the stakes for what tech journalists do from serving a small niche community to covering stories that have an impact on the wider world. In part, that’s due to the increasing importance of technology in our day-to-day lives. It’s also down to the characters involved and what’s at stake. Tech journalists have lived on fast-forward since Elon Musk first lodged his bid to take over Twitter – now X – in April 2022. We’ve been forced to drop everything and respond whenever he posted. And just when things were at their craziest, another paradigm-shifting technology arrived: ChatGPT. Plenty has happened since then. Like Musk, who planned to ride high with X but almost collapsed it, so too has OpenAI gone from top of the world to near-non-existence. (I recently presented a BBC Radio 4 documentary on 106 hours of chaos at OpenAI.) The world in January 2024 feels totally unlike the one we welcomed in January 2023 as the clock struck midnight. Could you have forecast on 1 January 2023 that OpenAI would depose its CEO, then bring him back after almost all of its employees threatened to quit? It’s foolish, then, to offer predictions about what 2024 will bring. But if I can offer guidance to what could be big stories in the year to come, it would be these … X v Threads gets a lot more interesting In July 2023, Meta quickly launched Threads, its purported X killer, in an attempt to capitalise on a weakness X faced at the time – little did we know then it would be one of many. However, the launch wasn’t wholly successful: so quickly did the Instagram parent company roll out its text-based social network, that it couldn’t offer the service to European consumers because it feared it would be in breach of EU rules. Shorn of nearly 400 million potential users, Threads looked like a damp squib. Five months later, Threads finally launched in Europe. The week after – and just seven days before Christmas – the EU launched an investigation into X, for allegedly breaching its laws on hate speech and disinformation. The potential outcome is a ban from operating in Europe. If the tables turn, it could be the decisive blow for Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg’s battle for supremacy. Big tech deals will get unwound – or won’t happen Mega-mergers were in vogue in the tech sector for a period in 2022 and 2023. But now they’re out of fashion, and that could affect the industry in 2024. Just before Christmas, Figma and Adobe abandoned their proposed merger after 15 months of trying to persuade regulators it should go ahead because … they weren’t convinced they could ever win the argument. Not everyone gives up, however: in October, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard succeeded in appeasing UK regulators the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Their $69bn merger will now go ahead. The big deal to look at in 2024 is the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI, which the CMA said it was investigating for potentially being anti-competitive. We won’t have long to wait: the deadline for comments on the partnership falls tomorrow, and we can expect an announcement on whether the CMA wants to take it further shortly. Cyber-attacks will continue to alarm Cybercrime costs UK companies £21bn a year, according to a government analysis. And while there haven’t been many blockbuster incidents that have bled into the mainstream – perhaps the most notable is the ongoing British Library outage, which is believed to be due to a ransomware attack – it’s likely that 2024 will see more high-profile and pernicious incidents occur. Who’ll win the AI race? The long year of 2023 was dominated by the multifarious impacts of AI on our lives, and 2024 looks likely to be equally AI-centric. From Google releasing Gemini, its latest state of the art AI model just under a month ago, to the excitement some had when ChatGPT started hallucinating that it has received an upgrade to the ballyhooed GPT-4.5 turbo model just before Christmas, it’s clear that the race is still on for AI supremacy. OpenAI’s stumbles in November – when, lest we forget, it went through three CEOs in a matter of days – have made it less certain that we’re all going to live by ChatGPT in the years to come. And there are a raft of exciting open-source models coming up on the rail. Get used to more excitement. The metaverse renaissance If you believed Mark Zuckerberg, 2022 was meant to be the year of the metaverse – remember, he renamed Facebook to Meta in October 2021, so enamoured was he by the potential of the virtual- and augmented-reality future. Of course, that didn’t happen, and the metaverse was eclipsed by AI in 2023. But in 2024, it could re-enter the public consciousness: Apple will be releasing its $3,500 Vision Pro headset some time this year, after announcing it midway through 2023. The smart money is that it will do for the metaverse what the iPhone did for smartphones, and the iPad did for portable tablet computing.
