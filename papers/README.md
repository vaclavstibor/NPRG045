# Papers
This repository is a collection of papers I have read and found interesting. I have also included some notes I have taken on the documents. The grouping idea is based on the desire to reflect on a specific part of each work that is exceptionally well-described.

[`links.txt`](links.txt) contains the links to the papers I want to read.
